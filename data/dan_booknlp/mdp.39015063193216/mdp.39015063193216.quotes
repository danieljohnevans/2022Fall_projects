6058	6070	6051	6051	People	417	” They laughed together . She decided to tell the truth . “
6084	6652	6081	6082	Loisaida girl	563	" He stroked an imaginary beard , as if contemplating this revelation . She saw that he wore a brace on his right forearm . It started at some point inside the jacket , covered the back of his hand and his palm but left the fingers free , separating only the thumb . As they talked , she stole guilty glances at it , wondering whether it compensated for a deformity or a broPOLYMORPH ken bone . It looked like the braces worn by roller bladers to keep their wrists from snapping when they fell , but those were usually made of black plastic and trimmed with fluorescent green or red . The boy 's brace was the dirty beige of an Ace bandage . He was from Nevada . His mom had been a telemarketer , laid off during the mid - nineties bank failures and still out of work . No dad was mentioned . The boy had the self - assured talk of the young men who had arrived in New York in time for the city 's renaissance at the turn of the century and had made good , or at least better than the rest of the country . He also had the self - deprecating manner of immigrants when they meet a native . He was vital but not dangerous . Refreshingly , he did not paint , act , or play music . She said little about herself . She was good at drawing others out . Constructing a new body for the night was hard enough without creating a new history as well . Her body , whatever its form , was solid and real . For any personal stories to make sense , she would have to fill them with lies . It did n't take much to draw Freddie out . He offered his ideas about the park 's demolition . He admitted that the planned light rail was already obsolete , since even the Canadians were building mag - lev lines now , but he had little use for the protesters . He did n't mention the PWHs . He took her to task , as a native New Yorker , for the city 's exploding steam pipes and crumbling bridges . Things would have to change , and soon . Fortunately , he said , a complete reworking of the city 's infrastructure was at hand . He explained that planned obsolescence had a silver lining . The things built in New York two hundred years ago the bridges , the roads — were built to last two hundred years . Things built a hundred years ago — the tunnels and housing — were built to last a hundred years . He asserted that nothing obsolete , lines now , but he the PWHs . Het testers . He din now , but he Lanadians weras alre 26 Scott Westerfeld built in the last twenty years could possibly last more than twenty years — and the federal housing built since the turn of the century , no more than five . Thus , the diminishing life spans were converging . Soon , in a colossal crash coordinated by humanity 's shrinking foresight , everything would fall apart at the same moment . The city would be left as flat as Belgrade after the Intervention . "
6656	6662	6081	6082	Loisaida girl	563	" he paused for effect , "
6684	6685	6081	6082	Loisaida girl	563	" "
6688	6951	7021	7021	He	570	" she asked . Naturally , the idea appealed to her . He looked at his watch gravely , and they laughed . He liked to find solutions for things . He was a technophile , but practical in a serpentine way . His opinions were long and complex , turning aside from obvious conclusions , contradicting themselves . She was soon comfortable with Freddie . When the beers were gone they finally accepted the music 's insistent call , dancing until they broke a solid sweat . The DJ was punctuating the music with sudden pauses . Short sampled phrases , sound bites lifted from the president 's latest reelection ads , stabbed into the silences . Out of context and isolated , his rhetoric sounded emptier than usual . As they danced , she noticed that Freddie was also listening . The music slowly elided into a more Gothic beat , until the infrabass shudder became unnerving . She bought a round , with cash , and led Freddie down to the water 's edge behind the amphitheater . A few hundred feet of the park had been fenced off and incorporated into Payday . They watched an ancient F train lumber across the Manhattan bridge . She took his hand , the one without the brace , in hers . He looked puzzled , rubbed his fingers across her palm , and caught her eye . One of his nervous POLYMORPH 27 pauses began . She waited . Then he slowly lifted her hand into the light and stared . "
6957	6965	6966	6966	You	569	" He said it with simple awe . "
6971	7000	6966	6966	You	569	" He did n't answer , splaying her fingers and staring at the hand like a child with a strange animal . He looked at the other hand . “

8076	8084	8073	8073	He	257	“ That 's just the screen saver . ”

8117	8166	8073	8073	He	257	" He said it with respectful finality . Freddie put on his qwerty bracelets , winding the fingerclips around his brace expertly . The explosions on his screen cleared away . A small menu appeared . Four names : Turbo , Action Jackson , C.C. , and Cosmo . “

8185	8240	8182	8182	I	0	” He peeled off his jacket , selected one of the names by touch , and began qwerting . The brace was beautiful against his pale skin . He qwerted in short , nervous spurts . He was incredibly quick . As he talked , his fingers kept up their dancing in the air . “
8315	8375	8377	8377	they	631	" His sudden bursts of qwerting flew by as text on the screen , each character corresponding to a different position of his fingers . There was a small snick of sound from the monitor confirming each letter . He had the capslock key down . He made errors in every line and did n't bother to correct them . “

8454	8562	8427	8427	AcNet	215	“ Nope . There are n't a lot of actors anymore . Now it 's the old hackers , the technical types who did n't like it when the net got user - friendly . Our motto is , Everything sucks but ASCII . All those faces on - screen made everyone too polite . The AcNet customers still like to flame and gender - surf and generally be assholes . They also stay here 'cause it 's one of the last places with all technical users . It 's a great place to pick up tips . But mostly , I make sure things stay animated . "
8563	8569	8427	8427	AcNet	215	" You talk to them ? "
8570	8602	8427	8427	AcNet	215	" I chat . I animate . When boring guys like Turbo and Action Jackson are on the line , someone has to provide some interest or everyone just signs off . ”

8625	8635	8636	8636	she	636	" So you 're sort of like a host ? "
8639	8674	8636	8636	she	636	“ Not really . I 'm what you might call a shill . They all think I 'm another subscriber . Most of them think I 'm a young NYU drama student named ME . "

10071	10108	10160	10160	he	257	“ Real easy . Subscribers pay fifteen cents a minute to stay on - line . When I 'm animating them , I get thirty percent of that for the time they spend chatting to me . "
10109	10117	10045	10045	he	257	" That 's how you get paid ? "
10118	10154	10160	10160	he	257	" Yep . Six or seven at once and it 's good money . These days , text - only is the boutique market , so the bastards who own this place really clean up . "

10827	10856	10764	10764	he	257	“ Anything like that : typing , assembly - line work , pushing a mouse . It 's neural damage from doing the same damn thing all day . "
10857	10866	10764	10764	he	257	“ Why do n't you use speech recognition ? "

10916	10935	10764	10764	he	257	" Speaking of speech , do n't these people ever use voice and visual ? It 's cheaper . "
10936	10968	10873	10873	he	257	" Anonymity is bliss ; you can say what you want . AcNet may be more expensive than a regular on - line , but it 's cheaper than a shrink . ”
11003	11025	11000	11000	She	668	“ Well , if you get carpal from doing the same thing for too long , let 's do something else . "

11788	11795	11796	11796	she	704	" You collect these old things ? "
11799	11808	11809	11809	He	257	" Yeah . LPs , they 're called . "
11836	11848	11831	11831	He	257	" It seems a little ... dark . Is it plastic ? "
11849	11860	11861	11861	he	257	“ Actually , you 're not supposed to touch them , "
11873	11880	11869	11869	He	257	“ It 's vinyl , actually . "
11951	11968	11969	11969	she	704	" How does the laser read vinyl ? It 's not very reflective , is it ? "
11999	12132	11969	11969	she	704	" He put the disk on the turntable . A small robot arm jerkily picked up from beside the turntable and swiveled until it was over the disk 's circumference band . The arm ended in a tiny pin that she assumed was the read head . It was odd seeing the workings of the machine out in the open . It made her slightly nervous . At least MD players were contained . After a moment 's pause , the arm lowered . She was alarmed for a second , thinking it was going to miss the disk altogether , but it made contact on the outer edge and Thorgruo dine the speakers suddenly sprang to life . The sound was a kind of low static , bright with tiny pops . “
12144	12153	11969	11969	she	704	" She looked at him a little quizzically . "
12156	12262	12263	12263	My	0	" The music started . It had a distant , haunting qualPOLYMORPH 87 ity , like the cry of a seagull . She had always heard that LPs were tinny , but this was not just lack of fidelity . It was as if the musicians were far down the hall of an old house . The quality of sound was familiar and comforting . It was , she realized , the melancholy sound - track quality that filmmakers used to signify nostalgia . There were saxophones and drums , and some sort of bass that was barely distinguishable above the rumble of the speakers . "
12273	12357	12266	12266	I	0	" Freddie was suddenly much happier . They danced , slowly , their bodies pressed together . They were about the same height . His arms wrapped around her . She reached through them to feel the muscles of his back and his tight shoulders . Her cheek rested against his , and she could smell the sharp scent of amphetamines on his sweat . So that was why he was so damn nervous . She kissed his ear and murmured into it . “
12363	12364	12439	12439	She	722	" "
12367	12373	12439	12439	She	722	" His voice sounded dry . “
12390	12413	12377	12377	You	0	” She kept up the massage of his shoulders . As his mind shifted to the explanation , he began to relax . "
12434	12435	12439	12439	She	722	" "
12453	12475	12439	12439	She	722	" Yeah . So the music is stored as undulations in a long sinuous groove on the surface of the record . "
12476	12483	12439	12439	She	722	" Mmmm . Tell me more . ”
12484	12506	12536	12536	He	723	“ And as the record rotates , the stylus — that 's the read head - slides along the groove . ... "
12507	12514	12515	12515	She	722	“ Are you making this up ? "
12539	12568	12536	12536	He	723	“ And the stylus moves with the un- 42 Scott Westerfeld dulations . Its vibrations , thousands per second , go to the speaker , which reconverts them . "
12569	12572	12536	12536	He	723	" Into ? "
12573	12578	12579	12579	They	724	“ ' Into music . ”

21748	21759	21733	21733	She	222	" There are more of us , are n't there ? "
21792	21832	21775	21775	Bonita	222	" Did n't you ever consider that you might not be the only one ? '' Lee considered this . There was a mass of unarticulated memories to be negotiated . She had never spoken to anyone of this . “
21836	21840	21775	21775	Bonita	222	" she said , “
21948	21955	21937	21937	adults	970	" Bonita looked at her quizzically . "
22049	22129	22130	22130	Bonita	222	" ' The big surprise was when I started experimenting with other kids . One by one the hidden things became unhidden . I smoked a joint , drank a six - pack and puked , blew a guy off , felt up another girl . But those experiments somehow never led to talk about changing . I kept waiting for some older kid to say , ' So , can you turn your cunt into a dick ? ' "
22166	22356	22163	22163	she	222	" Then I made friends with a kid called José . He was a pretty boy , and all the girls liked him . I thought I was in love with him . He was one of those kids who likes to play with his body . You know : burns his own skin with a lighter , puts a straight pin through the webs between his fingers , likes to show you his dick . He liked me because I could outdo all the other kids at the things close to his heart . I had double - jointed elbows , I could bend my fingers all Scott Westerfeld od the way back , and could curl my tongue like the devil , literally . So one day he came over and we spent an hour in the closet , trading secret knowledge by flashlight . I guess I went a little too far . I showed him one of my scariest face changes , which I used to practice in the mirror . He screamed bloody murder , ran like hell , and never came over again . "
22432	22445	22426	22426	Bonita	222	" So , you finally figured out that you were a freak . "
22446	22520	22577	22577	Bonita	222	" I was n't sure right away . But I started to get the general picture . I figured that José would tell his parents , or the police , or someone , and that I was in deep shit . When no one came to haul my freak ass away , I vowed to keep my power under my hat . Having made a fool of myself , I went totally underground . "
22521	22526	22528	22528	Bonita	222	" How very human , "
22530	22567	22568	22568	She	222	“ You made a mistake , so you adopted a position on the opposite extreme . Since everyone else was not a changer , no one else was . You went from Condom Catholic to existentialist . "

22662	22738	22647	22647	She	222	“ As I thought . The hands give you away , of POLYMORPH 69 course . Mother Nature did not come up with those mutations . But I was n't sure .

You did n't grow up with those hands , and you sure would n't have paid a surgeon for them . So I watched you . When you got into the pool , you took off your shoes . I looked hard , and your feet did n't have any calluses . Surprise , surprise . It 's a typical mistake , one I 've made myself . I was doppelgänging this guy 's wife , and I thought I had her perfect . But then he noticed that I was way too smooth ; no writer 's hump on my middle finger , no calluses on my heel , no cuticles "

23862	23869	23855	23855	he	987	" You son of a bitch ! "
23870	23887	23824	23824	Lee	191	" What 's your problem ? Do n't tell me you 've never had a cock . "
23888	23892	23893	23893	she	191	" I have , "
23910	23920	23896	23896	She	191	“ But this is not a place for pricks . "
23942	23958	23921	23921	He	987	" That does n't make any difference to us . Gender is a human thing . "
23974	23977	23978	23978	he	987	“ Besides , "
23981	24003	23978	23978	he	987	“ what 's it hurt these dykes ? Their mothers'd probably be glad they 're in the pool with a man . ”
24099	24105	24106	24106	His	987	“ ' You dyke bitch ! "
24344	24351	24338	24338	She	191	“ Did a woman just leave ? "
24352	24376	24377	24378	The woman	864	" No . Some guy with no shirt on did , though . Looked mad , too . Somebody cut his dick off ? "
24437	24445	24428	24428	Kathy	201	" Girl , you bopped that bitch ! "
24457	24476	24477	24477	Kathy	201	" I do n't know what she said to you , but I never liked her one bit . ”
24483	24496	24477	24477	Kathy	201	“ ' There was something about her that just pissed me off . "
24503	24521	24497	24497	Lee	191	“ ' You do n't know how glad I am to hear you say that , Kathy . "
27275	27278	27279	27279	he	257	" So , ”
27282	27291	27279	27279	he	257	" you 're a hell of a lover . "
27300	27313	27314	27314	He	257	“ ' I mean , next time leave a note or something . "
27322	27344	27345	27345	He	257	“ I 'm glad you showed up . I was gon na write you off as a dream . Nice dream . "
27348	27352	27345	27345	He	257	“ Nice haircut . "
27353	27357	27373	27373	himself	257	" ' Thanks . "
27379	27387	27371	27371	He	257	" I 'm glad you showed up . "
27388	27420	27373	27373	himself	257	" I 'm glad I found you . I did n't have your number , and your damn buzzers do n't work . It 's lucky I hit the right window . "
27421	27429	27373	27373	himself	257	" My number 's in the book . ”
27430	27438	27439	27439	He	257	" So what 's your last name ? "
27445	27448	27439	27439	He	257	" Smith . ”
27458	27469	27454	27454	he	257	“ I 'm serious , by the way . Smith . ”
27470	27478	27479	27479	His	257	" Okay , okay . Freddie Smith . ”
27483	27505	27479	27479	His	257	" Where 'd you get that scar ? '' She realized she had been fingering it unconsciously and dropped her hand . "
27510	27533	27506	27506	I	0	” He reached out and touched the scar . Another pause , that was more uncomfortable , and then he said haltingly , “
27545	27552	27534	27534	You	191	" He almost seemed to blush . "
27560	27561	27553	27553	I	0	" "
27599	27616	27575	27575	they	1097	" She smiled . For the last few weeks , the election POLYMORPH restau He laurant . "
27628	27636	27637	27637	she	191	“ It reduces their power over you , ”
27640	27663	27637	27637	she	191	" And it makes it hard to get any work done ! I have been the worst employee the last two days . "
27664	27672	27673	27673	He	257	" ' That 's what I mean . "
27680	27701	27673	27673	He	257	“ Oh , yeah . But I also mean , it makes it hard to concentrate . And to qwert ... "
27739	27748	27749	27749	His	257	“ I have a favor to ask you . "
27754	27757	27749	27749	His	257	" Sure . "
27768	27789	27790	27790	She	191	“ ' I have a receipt , from a restaurant , I think . I want to find the restaurant . "
27807	27814	27798	27798	He	257	“ Did you try this number ? "
27815	27868	27790	27790	She	191	“ Yes . It 's a bank access number . ' Candy ' is the PIN code . But that does n't help me . I need to find the restaurant . The Library has a database with restaurant menus , but I ca n't get anyone up there to help me . "
27869	27875	27876	27876	he	257	" You have interesting problems , "
27889	27896	27897	27897	she	191	" They 're in the kitchen , "
28037	28047	28048	28048	she	191	“ Are n't you going into the library service ? "
28051	28054	28055	28055	he	257	" Yeah , ”
28071	28115	28062	28062	he	257	“ But we 're going in through AcNet . NYPL responds faster if it thinks you 're a network . Besides , city databases cost money , and this could take a while . I 'd rather my employers pick up the tab . ”
28314	28387	28302	28302	He	257	“ Some of the older terminals at the Main Branch are pretty archaic , even compared to the primary system there , and they are n't directly connected to it . But they still maintain contact with their counterparts at other branches . If you build a UOS daisy chain of terminals out of and back into the Main POLYMORPH 85 Branch , you can through - put connections between unconnected machines . "
28388	28393	28394	28394	she	191	" Whatever you say , ”
28516	28521	28509	28509	He	257	“ tomorrow and tomorrow , "

28666	28674	28661	28661	He	257	“ Not fully compatible , I guess . "
28928	28932	28933	28933	he	257	" Got it ! "
29175	29206	29169	29169	He	257	“ There 's not a lot of power here . I do n't think it 'll search for item prices , which is all we 've got to go on . ”
29207	29215	29216	29216	she	1134	“ What 's under that dollar sign ? "
29225	29255	29216	29216	she	1134	“ That just gives a general range , from ' affordable ' to ' very expensive . ' We need to search based on specific prices of specific items . "
29261	29270	29271	29271	He	257	" By the way , check this out . "
29298	29302	29303	29303	she	1134	“ Very cute , "
29306	29322	29303	29303	she	1134	“ But back to our problem . Could n't we just search them all ? '' "
29352	29353	29345	29345	they	1137	" "
29356	29363	29345	29345	they	1137	" was all she could say . "
29366	29376	29345	29345	they	1137	" he said , his energy a little faded , “
29386	29518	29519	29519	Freddie	257	" They looked again at the receipt . It was dated June 4 . The meal was for two people : two soups , two entrées , and two coffees . Judging by the soups , the restaurant could have been French . But vichyssoise was a standard of expensive world cuisine , generic enough to be served at almost any fancy restaurant . She looked at the mysterious numbers between the 88 Scott Westerfeld subtotals and the final amount . One was probably the waitperson 's designation , another , clearly the sales tax . The tip was also there , printed in the same dot matrix font as the other numbers . It was not a round amount . She tried some mental arithmetic , but soon gave up . "
29528	29547	29519	29519	Freddie	257	" He looked at her , slightly indignant , as one appeared on screen , overlaying the menu . "
29578	29592	29570	29570	I	0	" Freddie qwerted , and the amounts appeared on the calculator 's readout . “
29601	29602	29570	29570	I	0	" "
29608	29609	29570	29570	I	0	" "
29617	29633	29570	29570	I	0	" Freddie said . He was silent for a second , then his eyes sparked . “
29655	29673	29644	29644	you	257	” He qwerted quickly , and numbers began to stack up on the calculator 's extended readout . “
29720	29721	29710	29710	You	257	" "
29734	29735	29736	29736	I	0	" "
29745	29749	29736	29736	I	0	" he said . “
29757	29761	29736	29736	I	0	" she answered . “
29777	29778	29736	29736	I	0	" "
29813	29895	29807	29807	anyone	848	" But he was already working . The calculator had been replaced by one of the menu program 's utilities . A long table scrolled by , an alphabetical list of restauPOLYMORPH 89 rants in its rightmost column . In the other columns of the table were various characteristics : credit card logos , the handicapped symbol , the green V for vegans , the cellular phone symbol with bar sinister . Freddie had highlighted one column , headed with the word "
29898	29985	29807	29807	anyone	848	" As restaurants flew by , she saw that a few had superscript numbers in the Special column . Freddie 's fingers moved like lightning . As each restaurant flew by , his left ring finger would flicker , and the restaurant name would carry a small black check as it filed up off the screen . He was manually marking all the fields containing a 5 . In the fine print that was constant at the bottom of the window , she found the reference : "
29992	29993	29807	29807	anyone	848	" “
30000	30049	29994	29994	We	1142	” he said . It was manual labor , like some particularly grueling video game , but Freddie 's speed never flagged . He punctuated his qwerting with curses . The process went on for twenty solid minutes . When it was done , he sighed and said , “
30074	30091	30069	30069	I	0	" Freddie compiled the list of restaurants he had marked . There were 124 in all . "
30094	30098	30069	30069	I	0	” she said . “
30107	30108	30069	30069	I	0	" "
30111	30115	30069	30069	I	0	" said Freddie . “
30124	30129	30069	30069	I	0	" He began qwerting . “
30156	30187	30190	30190	You	0	" In a few seconds , the list shrank noticeably . She laughed , and clapped him on the back . The list was down to a few dozen restaurants . “
30211	30239	30240	30240	We	1142	" But Freddie was staring , openmouthed . He took 90 Scott Westerfeld the receipt from her and stared at it . Then he shook his head . “
30246	30265	30240	30240	We	1142	" He called up the menu for one of the restaurants and pointed . Vichyssoise was $ 17.95 . “
30272	30293	30269	30269	you	1150	" He pointed at the restaurant 's name , emblazoned large at the top of the menu . It was called “
30296	30416	30269	30269	you	1150	" He handed her the receipt . Of course . Candy . She groaned . The name was n't just a bank access number . Like most people , when Bonito chose the PIN numbers and other codes that identified him , he picked words and names that meant something personal . Candy was a PIN number and a restaurant . Lee considered this . She had glimpsed narrowly into Bonito 's life . The information , even if it was basically insignificant , gave her confidence . Lee was willing to bet that Candy was Bonito 's favorite restaurant . It was , in any case , a place to start . Freddie leaned back and sighed deeply . “
30424	30475	30269	30269	you	1150	" She wanted to laugh but held her hands to her mouth . Freddie 's hands hung slackly , his eyes were red - rimmed . She took his wrist and looked at the clock on his qwerty bracelet . They had been at it for more than an hour . "
30487	30519	30483	30483	You	0	" He looked at her with a weary smile . Then he held his wrist where she had touched him . It was the wrist he had worn his brace on . "
30532	30536	30524	30524	I	0	" he began . “
30542	30553	30632	30632	her	1151	" she interrupted . He looked wearily at the monitor . "
30557	30579	30580	30580	She	1151	“ Shit , I 've got to go . Listen , I owe you a big favor . I 'll call . "
30589	30598	30599	30599	he	0	" Do n't you have a phone number ? "
30604	30620	30632	30632	her	1151	" No . No phone . Honest . But you 're Freddie Smith , right ? "
30621	30628	30629	30629	She	1151	“ Right . In the book . ”
30647	30654	30655	30655	she	1151	“ Are you the only one ? "
30657	30663	30655	30655	she	1151	“ ' The only what ? "
30664	30674	30675	30675	He	0	“ The only Freddie Smith . In the book . ”
30679	30689	30675	30675	He	0	“ I do n't know . I doubt it . "
30690	30697	30655	30655	she	1151	" I 'll try them all . "
30698	30704	30705	30705	he	0	" It serves you right , "
30712	30721	30705	30705	he	0	" Good - bye , and thanks again . ”
30737	30745	30746	30746	he	0	“ I hope you find this guy , "
30749	30754	30746	30746	he	0	“ But call anyway . "
30755	30759	30760	30760	she	1151	" I will , ”
32928	32934	32935	32935	He	511	" This looks like it . ”
33195	33200	33179	33181	A young woman	1240	“ Welcome to Candy . "

36541	36545	36523	36532	a man of color with a patois name and accent	1417	“ Where to ? "
36546	36555	36556	36556	He	234	" Follow the cab in front of us . "
36564	36569	36570	36571	the driver	511	" You mean it ? "
36574	36581	36570	36571	the driver	511	“ You a reporter , right ? "
36593	36599	36582	36583	The woman	864	" Why do you ask ? "
36600	36632	36570	36571	the driver	511	" Come on , man ! You want me to follow the girlfriend of the King of America , and you are not a reporter ? Who you think you fooling ? "
36633	36639	36640	36641	The cabbie	606	" The King of America ? "
36646	36656	36640	36641	The cabbie	606	" Do n't you know the King , man ? "
36657	36693	36695	36696	Scott Westerfeld	235	" Ĩ did n't know we had a king . In fact , I did n't know we had much of a government at all right now . The election seems to have paralyzed everything . "
36722	36758	36717	36717	he	511	“ Ah ! You may not know it . He 's much more important than the President . He 's the one with the big power . Enter , Accept , Confirm . The King . "
36802	36841	36842	36843	The man	488	" ' That 's right ! That 's why he 's come , to give us a king . Maybe it 's not so good to have a king , but it 's better than nothing at all . ”
36858	36865	36852	36852	he	488	" Take it from a Haitian . "
37151	37158	37148	37148	he	1416	" What you think , man ? "
37184	37189	37190	37190	Milica	234	" This is fine , "
37193	37210	37211	37212	the cabbie	606	" So , if you are not a reporter , you maybe just like this girl ? "
37215	37218	37219	37219	Milica	234	“ Actually , "
37222	37230	37219	37219	Milica	234	“ I think she 's in danger . "
37231	37255	37190	37190	Milica	234	“ From you ? You do n't look like a dangerous man . And the King , he look like a nice man . "
37256	37259	37260	37260	He	1416	" No . "
37272	37291	37292	37293	The driver	511	“ From someone I met last night . A real mean son - of - a - bitch . "
37296	37344	37292	37293	The driver	511	" Well if I was you , I 'd tell the King . He 'll kick that son - of - a - bitch 's ass . He 'll kick your ass , too , you mess with his girlfriend . Newsday says they are in love . "
37352	37358	37345	37346	The driver	511	“ In love , huh . "
37359	37379	37400	37401	the cabbie	606	“ It 's a Cinderella story , man . She a local punk girl , and him a king ! "
37380	37386	37387	37387	Milica	234	" Thanks for the advice , "
37390	37393	37387	37387	Milica	234	" Bye . ”
37394	37398	37400	37401	the cabbie	606	" Take care , "
37462	37554	37454	37454	He	234	" No ... King , he looki look like a de 's in danger ... 110 Scott Westerfeld opened his shirt , trying to look like he belonged in the neighborhood . The building was an old church , decorated with a crude mural of Jesus , in whose chest an anatomically correct heart glowed bizarrely . Behind Jesus a cityscape had been painted that matched the view uptown . The painted city was alive with glowing headlights , windows , streetlights . Under Jesus , a scroll bore the words , “
37561	38245	37454	37454	He	234	” The windows of the church were boarded over . The crucifix above the door was decorated with bits of broken mirror and safety glass . Shiny fragments had also been glued to the surrounding brick , as had a host of cherubic plaster faces . From the basement doorway into which the woman had disappeared came the muffled murmur of a crowd . A color photocopy of a row of drummers on the door was captioned , TONIGHT : EMPIRE LOISAIDA SAMBA . SCHOOL . Nailed to the door above it was a crudely painted sign : LOISAIDA SOCIAL CLUB Inside the door , two young Hispanic men checked him out . The cover was five dollars . A pall of smoke hung from the low ceiling . A hundred - or - so customers crowded the basement room , dancers occupying a good part of the floor . Behind them , a line of about a dozen drummers swayed as a short white woman shook out a compound rhythm on a beaded gourd , soloing while the rest of the drummers caught their breath . Beside her , an old Hispanic man listened intently , eyes shut , a metal whistle in his mouth . Along the far side of the club a makeshift bar had been constructed , a row of sawhorses that held HARD plastic I - beams . The red - haired woman was there , sitting on a rickety stool , a can of beer beside her . He made his way toward her . The gourd player 's solo waned in energy , tapering off to a quiet but persistent shake . The old man raised POLYMORPH 111 one hand , and the drummers lifted their sticks . There were tambourines , small hand drums with bright tassels , a trio of snares , a whole family of larger drums , a concert bass that almost hid the Asian kid it was strapped to . The old man blew three sharp blasts , reestablishing the almost lost tempo . There was one silent fourth beat , filled by a gasp from the crowd . Then the sound of the massed drums exploded like a car bomb in the small club . The concussion of sound struck Milica bodily , almost halting his progress . Around him , onlookers flowed like water onto the dance floor . The naked rhythm was furious , driving the dancers into a blind frenzy . Milica stumbled as he negotiated the maelstrom . When he reached the bar , he stripped off his jacket . The length of the bar had been half - emptied by the music , but the red - haired woman remained . He slipped onto the stool next to her . She gave him a sidelong look and seemed to recognize him . The bartender brought an open beer and spread his fingers to indicate five dollars . Milica paid . The beer was a Brazilian import , the can warm in his hand . The empty case - boxes stacked behind the bar bore its logo . Evidently , it was the only drink the social club served , and to sit down was to order one . It was thick as English bitter . For warm beer , it was good . In the hot , smoky club , logy with rich and exotic food , it was the last thing Milica needed . The woman 's legs were crossed , and from this distance he could see her tattoo through fishnet stockings . It was a trompe l'oeil , designed to look like the flesh of her leg was freshly torn . Inside the shadows of the faux wound , Milica glimpsed the metallic sheen of vaguely organic machine parts . It looked like the leg of a damaged cyborg ; torn flesh and rup- 112 Scott Westerfeld tured machinery wound together indistinguishably . He had seen the style before . She caught him staring and shifted to give him a better look . “

38731	38744	38745	38745	He	234	" No . Actually , it 's all done with wooden tools . ”
38764	38776	38745	38745	He	234	" I guess you would n't call them tattoos . Scarification . "

39181	39326	39174	39174	they	1470	" There was a pause . As it stretched out , he felt the connection they had established slowly unravelling . Her reactions were somehow distant . He caught an image of himself in a dirty mirror behind the bar , and remembered how plain and unremarkable he had made his face . It had been a long time since he had been anything but beautiful , or at least striking . He considered how different it was to be averagelooking , how it affected even the most simple conversation . As practiced as he had become at facile repartee , he realized that most of his ease with people was bought with the superficial currency of appearance . It brought back memories of childhood . He had been plain faced as a little girl . He tried to salvage the conversation . POLYMORPH 115 "

42411	42476	42374	42374	he	257	” 126 Scott Westerfeld The water , extravagantly heated and pressured , restored her humanity . Drying herself , she stared sullenly at the filthy pile of clothes she had discarded . She stepped out of the bathroom naked . Freddie was microwaving two mugs of his Japanese coffee drink . He looked at her body in a kind of unself - conscious daze . "
42484	42498	42374	42374	he	257	" He rubbed sleep from his eyes and managed to find his voice . "
42503	42687	42374	42374	he	257	" The microwave buzzed . He looked at it as if the sound were new to him . She searched his closet with coffee mug in hand . The plastic was strangely hotter than the coffee . Freddie stood by , having rediscovered his self - consciousness , his eyes on the brick wall outside his bedroom window . It did n't take long for her to dress . Compared to her collection , Freddie 's clothes were all woefully alike . She chose a black shirt with brightred sleeves and a pair of huge - legged shorts like roller bladers wore . They came to just above her knees . As she pulled them up , he turned toward her . She looked into his still - sleepy eyes , and for the first time noticed they were flawed with tiny radial keratomy scars . . There was one of Freddie 's usual pauses . He seemed in no hurry to speak . She realized she did n't know what to tell him . For once , the silence made her nervous . "
42693	42715	42374	42374	he	257	" she offered . It felt like an idiotic thing to say , but it roused him . He smiled happily . “

42849	42871	42946	42946	You	1571	” He made an expansive gesture with his mug . It seemed to refer to her , to the whole situation . "
42874	42878	42946	42946	You	1571	" she paused . “
42895	42945	42946	42946	You	1571	" She had meant to be flip but sounded to herself as if she was on the edge of hysteria . He did n't react , except to take a drink of coffee . They looked at each other . She decided to say as much as she could . "
42957	42961	42946	42946	You	1571	" she asked . "
42973	42990	42967	42967	you	1571	” Freddie was speaking carefully . He did n't sound completely friendly . She went on . “
43016	43024	43009	43009	he	1572	" She looked down at her hands . "
43030	43037	43038	43038	I	0	" His reserve had n't lifted . "
43078	43079	43068	43068	I	0	" "
43082	43108	43068	43068	I	0	" he said . The sound was completely noncommittal . She already regretted her decision to tell anything of the truth , but barreled ahead . “
43157	43185	43144	43144	he	1572	" 128 Scott Westerfeld He considered this . The mention of the smartcard seemed to steady him , to put him on firmer ground . He said , “
43210	43216	43217	43217	He	1572	" She shook her head . “
43251	43255	43246	43246	someone	361	" Freddie nodded . "
43258	43276	43278	43278	Your	1577	" There was a flicker in his eye , and he added , as if an afterthought , “
43283	43284	43285	43285	My	0	" “
43288	43350	43285	43285	My	0	" she started , her mouth dropping open . Her hand went to her cheek . The knife wound she had opened two nights before was gone . It had been subsumed in her change to a male body , and she 'd forgotten to replace it . She tried to smile , as if letting him in on a joke . “
43369	43375	43360	43360	Gothics	252	" His voice was steady . “
43390	43581	43582	43582	Your	1579	” He reached out , and she took an involuntary step backward . He waited , arm half outstretched , until she moved forward again . He took her hand . Looked at it intently . Took the other . He splayed the two sets of fingers out . Inside her , a cycle of adrenaline and noradrenaline began , the sick feeling of panic being fought under control . It was made worse by the realization that she was not preparing for violence or action ; there was no fighting or flight out of this situation . She was being violated again . Her citadel of privacy , of deception , was again under attack . She knew that the deformed hands were not the same . Her transition , without a mirror , without enough sleep , without the X - rays and 3 - D views on a nearby screen , had been faulty . She had n't realized how perceptive he was , how exactly he had noted the deformity . POLYMORPH 129 He raised his eyes to hers . She could not hide her panic . "
43587	43746	43582	43582	Your	1579	" He put it simply . As if it were some interesting but unenlightening datum amid a host of clues . She had never seen anyone react to this discovery before , and she had no idea what to expect . Only Bonito , with his sick and knowing smile , had ever found her out ; and Bonito was a polymorph himself . Freddie looked at her steadily , the impossibility and the truth of what he was suggesting dawning on him slowly and surely . There was a long pause , in which her mind flailed for the radical act that would save her secret . The pressure in her head built , until the red mist of an incipient blackout gathered at the edges of her sight . She removed her hands from his grasp and sat down heavily on the carpeted floor . He was instantly beside her , an arm around her shoulders . "
43753	43765	43766	43766	I	0	" he asked , his voice soft for the first time . "
43769	43776	43766	43766	I	0	" she choked on the word . "
43781	44062	43766	43766	I	0	" She constricted into a fetal curl , tired and disoriented from too many changes , feeling a hundred times more naked than she had in front of Bonito . Freddie , a monomorph , had begun to see her for what she was . The nervous energy building inside her finally found purchase : It triggered the chemical of a change . She submitted to it and held out her hand to Freddie . The fire formed in her abdomen , became a pulsating sphere . The muscles of her arm bulged as the ball of pain forced its way toward her hand . There were a dozen unrelated , unbidden transformations , spontaneous in the wake of the fire . Her right aureole flared , one shoulder dislocated , and she felt the warm rush of a swath of melanin breaking into a mottled birthmark on her forearm . When the fire 130 Scott Westerfeld reached her hand , she set it to work savagely ; breaking down the small bones before they were properly limbered , threading the muscles strong and thick through the lengthening digits , leaving nervous tissue screaming in the skin as she reshaped her hand against his . When she was done , she opened her eyes , blinking away sweat . He sat , expressionless , staring at her transformed hand on his lap . It looked a little swollen and it ached badly , but it was basically normal . Next to it , her other hand looked freakish . She sat , raising herself a little tenderly on the new hand . He was speechless . She tried to smile . "
44069	44070	44065	44065	you	1581	" "
44082	44102	44103	44103	You	1581	" There was no accusation in his voice ; just a small distance , someone speaking of something lost . "
44114	44119	44112	44112	you	1581	" she said tiredly . "
44131	44155	44112	44112	you	1581	" She rose to her knees . Now that she had shown him the change , she was pleading for him to understand . “
44206	44226	44200	44200	I	0	" His eyes came up from the spot where her hand had changed . They were clear , penetrating . "
44235	44253	44200	44200	I	0	" he added . He rubbed one forearm against the other , frantically , like a junkie . "
44289	44323	44278	44278	You	1581	" As she nodded , he moved forward , grasping her by the shoulders . The right one was sore , and she cried out . He kissed her softly on the mouth . “
44328	44435	44326	44326	you	1581	" he said . He held her , and after a while the fear that had POLYMORPH 131 sutured her to consciousness collapsed . Slowly , she passed out in his arms . She awoke on the futon . He was watching her from the floor a few feet away . She came fully awake quickly . His gaze was too intent to doze under . She was naked . Her hands , shoulders , nipples were uneven . The new birthmark was still there . She rubbed her normal hand with the alien one and sat up to lean against the coolness of the wall . "
44439	44454	44455	44455	I	0	" she asked . She tried to find terror or disgust in his gaze . “
44462	44480	44455	44455	I	0	" He smiled . There was only amazement in his eyes . And something else . Affection . "
44487	44488	44455	44455	I	0	" “
44491	44492	44455	44455	I	0	" "
44495	45174	44455	44455	I	0	” The prosaic thought of food filled her with relief . While he took a shower , she dressed and turned the VTV to cable mode , losing herself to the mindnumbing drama of the Housing Court Channel . They ate Japanese at a restaurant next door . It was only two in the afternoon . Her imbalanced hands were far more embarrassing — and annoying - than they had been when both were deformed . Her new hand was still swollen , and chopsticks proved impossible despite her ambidexterity . She was too mentally and physically exhausted to make any corrections yet , having changed more often in the last few days than she usually would have in a month . She answered Freddie 's questions as well as she could . It was hard to fight her instincts , which screamed for deception . But the slow unraveling of the truth brought an awesome feeling of release . As they had with Bonita two nights before , her memories unfolded pristine and urgent . Her life 's story was unrehearsed , unarticulated . Wally wou more ofte make 132 Scott Westerfeld The telling was new territory to be traversed , unrefined by the habits of a familiar narrative . She realized how strange it was to have such a strange story , yet never to have told it . Because Freddie was from the Midwest , he was amazed even by the mundane : childhood in the projects , a public school education in impoverished New York . He was as interested in these as in her slow realization of her ability and of its uniqueness . It made telling the story easier , to mix the prosaic fact of an absent father with her secret experimentation on skin , bone , and sinew . Judging from his reaction , her first venture out in a fully changed body as a teenager seemed no more strange to him than her everyday existence in welfare housing . Instead of Bonita 's knowing smirk , Freddie 's reaction was unconcealed awe . His mind was quick to adapt , however , to see the inherent tensions and challenges in her position . His questions were intelligent and teased out strands of continuity in her life that , having no interlocutor , she had never assembled before . For five years her life as a polymorph , scattered among clubs and communities , sundry identities and sexualities , had shown her a host of difference . She had learned not to take sides and to accept any number of roles . She looked on the monomorph concept of identity with contempt . It was founded on violence and power . In a terrifying city , full of people who clung to their roles as a bulwark against its horror , she had sought anonymity as a moral imperative . But as she spoke to Freddie , the flow of memory broadened and her past began to open to her . She began to rethink her isolation . Bonita 's appearance had triggered a need that had long been latent in her . She had assumed that the community of polymorphs was the answer to that POLYMORPH 133 need , the hunger for a tribe . But now the desire was changing in her , taking on a more concrete form . She wanted to organize her memories for a listener , to explain her life story . As she spoke , she realized that she had been living without a past . It had been a pleasant hedonism , timeless and anonymous , but it was utopian in both senses of the word : a good place and no place at all . She found herself tripping over words in her hurry to tell Freddie everything , to explain everything . There was a fierce need to draw together the many lives and make a life . Across the small table from Freddie , she began to invent herself . “
45182	45197	45176	45176	you	1585	" he had asked at one point . She was still trying to answer . "
45210	45228	45229	45229	I	0	" She saw him register the idea that she had an original self , an infant body . “
45330	45375	45376	45376	Freddie	257	" She seemed to need to secure these things , these objects , this house . And as I followed her around , half hoping she would take a picture of me , I saw something in the flash : that everything was frozen . "
45382	45419	45376	45376	Freddie	257	“ You know , when the flash pops and there 's an afterimage burned into your eyes . That was what my mother wanted — that freezing flash - to keep everything the way it was . “
45528	45532	45507	45507	she	1594	" She laughed . "
45579	45580	45582	45582	you	0	” "
45584	45591	45582	45582	you	0	" he asked , all amazement . “
45639	45716	45725	45725	she	1598	" But anyway , to answer your question , I do n't see my mother anymore . After I moved out , I tried to , but it was such a drag changing back into that old body . She had my address , and she came by once looking for me . I told her to her face I did n't know who she was talking about . I was a man at the time . "
45734	45742	45743	45743	she	1598	" ' I moved a week later , "
45750	45768	45743	45743	she	1598	" Since then , there 's been no one . No one who knows who I am . "
45769	45778	45779	45779	Freddie	257	" So , I 'm your only friend , ”
45795	45802	45783	45783	She	1598	“ And Bonito my only enemy . "
45803	45829	45746	45746	her	1598	“ Right , Bonito . So how the hell did he find out your dark secret ? Did he catch you in the act ? '' "
45832	45915	45746	45746	her	1598	" She paused . Having told Freddie about herself , she was still reluctant to reveal that Bonito was also a polymorph . Not that she gave a damn about Bonito 's privacy . It was just that Freddie would realize that if there were two polymorphs , there were probably many . As long as Freddie thought of her POLYMORPH 135 as unique , a mutant , the larger community of polymorphs ( wherever they were ) was still a secret . “
45967	45968	45958	45958	he	1599	" “
45977	45991	45958	45958	he	1599	" said Freddie , in a voice that did n't confirm belief . . “

46471	46914	46354	46354	I	0	" She snorted . They paid and left . say so ary syste Playir effect . In a strongbox high in his closet , Freddie had a knife as well . A triangular - bladed trench knife , military issue and a lot more battle - worthy than her Canal Street switchblade . She slipped the knife into the enormous pockets of her shorts . It had just about enough blade to piss Bonito off . She also took a large black vinyl duffel bag that she had seen in the closet . They taxied to the bank in an unair - conditioned electric Ford whose radio cheerily announced that it was over ninety degrees again . Freddie waited outside with the weapons . The metal detector at the bank 's door offered a gravely digital Thank you . Downstairs , she leaned over an ancient and grimy retina scanner . Bright green flickered over her eye twice , and another synthesized voice assented . The guard , a short and compact black man , left her alone with the safe - deposit box in a cubicle with yellowing seven - foot walls . She would have traded him the box 's entire contents for the pistol he wore , an old but formidable revolver with a wide , short barrel . POLYMORPH 137 Inside the box was another smartcard , reassuringly identical to her last one . The picture her mother had taken was also there . After a painful glance , she left the picture . The dues on the box were paid up in cash for seven years . Some part of her might as well have a home . She was glad she had n't charged the box to her smartcard . The safe - deposit box was the last inviolate corner of her life . The sun was bright outside , and she made a mental note to collect her sunglasses at the apartment . She remembered to take the knife back from Freddie . They ate at a Dominican - run Mexican restaurant called El Sombrero , taking their time , waiting for evening . She wanted to enter the projects after kids had gotten home from school and were playing in the hallways and stairwell . She figured that if Bonito turned into anything too monstrous , some kid might shoot him . They waited . She was quiet . Freddie asked her what Bonito looked like . She described him roughly as he had appeared at Glory Hole , knowing it was useless . She warned Freddie that Bonito might have hired someone else . "
46918	47195	46354	46354	I	0	" he said . Her nervousness began to rub off on Freddie , and he began talking about his childhood . They split one margarita and then another as the sunlight angled steeper and steeper . She fed the jukebox her last few dollar coins , stalling and trying to find a samba piece with only drums . There were none on the box 's drive . Finally , Freddie paid and pulled her to the door . Her project was two blocks away . As they entered the lobby , the old men looked up from their game of dominoes . She looked them over surreptitiously . All looked vaguely familiar . One or two of their glances lingered over her still - freakish hand . She wished that she had changed for this . If Bonito was waiting , she was making it easy for him . 138 Scott Westerfeld Freddie pushed the Up button , but she nodded toward the stairs . He was n't used to the climb , and outside the eleventh floor they waited in the stairwell as he caught his breath . He went out first , calling an all - clear after a few seconds . She controlled her adrenaline as it built and then let it rush through her system , drawing the knife as she carded open her door . The bedroom was empty , untouched . She nodded Freddie toward the closet . He swung around the door frame with his stun gun at the ready , like a TV detective at a murder scene . He lowered it and smiled nervously back at her . “
47206	48197	46354	46354	I	0	" She pushed past him , peering into the dark corners . No one was here . She paused to neutralize some of her adrenaline , pocketed the knife . He stayed in the closet , still a little awed , while she went to work in the bedroom . First , she doublelocked the door . The optical anatomy disks did n't take up much room in the duffel bag , nor did a hard copy of Milica Raznakovic 's welfare records . At some point , she might want to reconstruct the identity . She went through the pockets of a few discarded pants and came up with three more dollars in change . Standing with the third - full duffel bag , she was struck with how little there was to gather . No diaries , no notebooks , no flopticals backing up a desktop calendar , no friends ' phone numbers , no business cards , no saved letters , no college papers . Almost nothing . There was a list in her head , assembled from observation , from conversations , from films about normal people . A list of things she knew she should have collected over twenty - three years but had n't . Her college papers and the letters from her short attempts at relationships were gone , trashed . Most of the rest had never existed to begin with . Just Freddie was there . POLYMORPH 139 She approached him from behind , put her hands on his shoulders . He turned around and they kissed . In the hot mustiness of the closet , she felt safe for a moment . Pressed against her shorts , Freddie was growing hard . His hands massaged the tightness in her shoulders , and she relaxed . The clothes were her one collection , the one record of her life . As she looked with half - lidded eyes across his shoulder at them , they told stories from the last five years . She would bury a thousand lovers when she left this room . She and Freddie kissed again , and she pushed him back against the soft mass of clothing hung on the wire . The coats , shirts , and dresses parted for them , swallowed them . She reached behind her to a stack of three wired - together milk cartons , tipped it over . A bed of scarves , socks , hats , T - shirts , and underwear scattered from the cartons . She knelt , holding his shoulders tight so that her weight brought him down . His clothes were light , elastic - waisted , cotton — the insubstantial garments of summer . His body surrendered them easily . He watched her silently as she stripped herself , his gaze on the nipple that her earlier change had disrupted . She held her breasts with the dissimilar hands , squeezed them tightly for a second to sharpen the blood flow in them . She leaned over to kiss him , hard and long , until their lips swelled against each other . She straightened and then arched her spine , missing the feeling of hair falling against her back . Freddie took a condom from his pocket and broke its package . She breathed in the bright smell of antiviral lubrication . The chemicals of change and sex were coursing strong enough to admit him easily inside . She stroked him with a small rocking motion , letting herself gasp aloud at the pain in her knees , hard against the floor . The change built , until her vagina nie took a conreathed in the of change ancily inside 140 Scott Westerfeld was articulated enough to undulate with its own muscles . On her toes , she lifted her knees off the floor , squatting down hard onto Freddie 's pelvis . He groaned and grabbed her wrists . Her palms were pressed sweatily against his chest . The compression waves inside her gradually changed to a slow constriction around his cock . She tightened the grasp of the vaginal muscles into a double twist , like two hands wringing a rag , and Freddie cried out so sharply she almost released him . But his panting steadied , remaining short and harsh . She wrung him again , in the opposite direction , and his groan was definitely pleasure . As the new muscles organized themselves inside her to optimize the hard and twisting constrictions , she gained purchase with her feet . She pushed up and forward , resuming the rocking stroke along the length of his cock . He cried out again as the coarse motion of their bodies compounded her internal manipulations . The sex became fast and hard , frantic in the compromised security of her apartment . She led him quickly to orgasm , squeezing red hand marks into the skin of his chest as he came . His cry of pleasure trailed off a little painfully , and she stopped her motion against him . With his breath still gasping , she tightened herself around his cock and let herself come to orgasm in a slow , determined wave . Freddie felt the wave hit and cried out along with her . They shuddered together through a lingering series of aftershocks . She leaned back , propping herself up with weak wrists . As they separated , the condom pulled off of Freddie 's cock and remained half inside her . She sat back into a split and pulled it out . Freddie smiled at her , a little embarrassed . She leaned forward and went down on him . He protested feebly but unmistakably , and she desisted . His cock was hot and limp , a little worse for the wear . POLYMORPH 141 "

48231	48363	48221	48221	I	0	" She laughed . Next time , they would n't be so rushed . They dressed and she gathered a few favorite clothes , mostly female , filling the duffel bag . She figured she could use Freddie 's clothes if she changed back to a male . He was about her weight . She smiled at the thought of being male ; she could show Freddie a few tricks he did n't know yet . At the door she remembered her sunglasses . Her final look at the apartment did n't last long . The place was already fading into the distance . Too much had changed in the last few days to linger at this oasis of false security . Freddie drew his weapon as he unlocked the door . "

48385	48468	48221	48221	I	0	” She scrabbled among the matchbooks and condoms in the ashtray by the door . The receipt was there . As she picked it up , her heart fell . On the side with the phone number and PIN code , more had been written . It read , in a tiny and precise hand : I 'm closer to you than you are to me . Freddie was out in the hall , looking both ways . He turned to her . "
48472	48741	48221	48221	I	0	" Speechless , she pushed the receipt toward him . His eyes focused on it , and his expression sharpened . He snatched it from her and thrust it into his pocket . Switching the stun gun to his left hand , he grabbed her wrist and pulled her out . The door swung closed and locked itself behind them . They took the stairs fast . Halfway down , a pair of murmuring voices to his hele door Smok the 142 Scott Westerfeld she had borking and backed a Freddie 's air below them brought Freddie to a halt . He rounded the next corner slowly , stun gun extended . She saw that it was the Chinese couple whose daughter 's face she had borrowed . At the sight of the gun , the two stopped talking and backed fearfully into an access door . Until they disappeared , Freddie 's aim never wavered . They ran the rest of the way down . At the curb outside the projects , a short Hispanic man was paying off a taxi . She pushed past the man and into the cab . Freddie joined her and shouted at the driver to roll . The driver shrugged her shoulders and the car jolted into the light traffic . She turned to look out the back window as Freddie gave directions . Bonito was there . He was a man . Dark and smiling , dressed all in black , he jogged after them . The cab was slowing for the turn onto Delancey , and he was gaining . “
48746	48793	48744	48744	him	1616	" she said quietly . Freddie turned to her and then whirled around to face the back . His stun gun came up . The cab turned right onto Delancey and sped up . Bonito fell back . Freddie sighed with relief . '' Thank God . "

The room was full of sprawling schematic before they gave up . The INS was a vast system , as chaotic as the New York Public Library . Bonito had n't left a trail . They returned to her personal finances . Sam worked for a while longer , then leaned back into his chair . that was it one byte was the intrusion POLYMORPH 159 "

54535	54659	54532	54533	this guy	2623	" He tried to sound enthusiastic . Sam considered this , a little hesitant at first . Then he flexed his fingers . The rubric of her finances melted . It had been a village , a few huts and dirt paths . It was replaced by a city . It hovered around them , a megalopolis of blue whorls and red shafts , mottled clouds and bright suspended pixels . Thin translucent red lines connected everything , arcing over their heads , splitting off to other distant clusters that hovered beyond the walls of the room . Red lines shot straight through the three of them , seeming to reduce their bodies to phantasms . The dense crimson web pulsated in intensity . “
54665	54836	54532	54533	this guy	2623	” said Freddie in quiet awe . As Sam worked , the whorls deepened in complexity , shifted in size and orientation . She asked for Eyemouse Help and probed the iconography . She learned that the red shafts represented transactions , aggregates of market activity between the various banks , S&Ls , government agencies , insurance companies , brokerages , currency houses , on - line individuals . The blue galaxies in their various 160 Scott Westerfeld forms - spirals , fractaloids , latticeworks , hexagonal mosaics — were large , highly regulated institutions . The dusty point clouds were more complex consortia , like mutual funds and university endowments . Here and there a lone bright pixel denoted a super - rich individual whose personal computers traded in the big leagues . The faraway clusters , seemingly several meters past the walls in the forced perspective of the VR visor , were other markets . Freddie pointed out Tokyo , Hong Kong , London , Hanoi , Moscow . "

54859	54938	54853	54853	I	0	" he added a little condescendingly . Her tiny account was safely locked in an inflation - rate bond , one of the few remaining government - insured instruments . Sam had Bonito 's receipt in hand . He qwerted a few numbers and pointed . Near the center of an elongated point cloud that hovered near Freddie 's foot , a single pixel flashed . A thin green line connected it to a detail window before Sam . “
54941	54945	54853	54853	I	0	” said Freddie . “

54971	55157	54959	54959	I	0	" Sam had blown up the detail window . As his fingers moved , highlights probed the window . Slivers of the red shafts emanating from the cloud turned white : Bonito 's money at work . More detail windows appeared before Sam , and he probed each for a few moments . More connections were made . The fragile network of white lines expanded , extending new feelers to other clouds and other galaxies . After ten minutes , the expansion stopped , and Sam leaned back to regard the detail windows that overlapped in an untidy batch before him . The white web now touched a few dozen financial entities . He frowned and gestured toward the swarm of windows , qwerting as he did so . look at the names POLYMORPH 161 For a moment she was confused . Then she realized that every detail window had a supertitle ; a company name in bright SEC blue . They meant nothing to her : Transfund Ltd. , World Enterprises , Global Custody , Universal Mercantile , Trade Internationale ... none were familiar . "
55168	55192	55159	55159	I	0	” Freddie echoed her thoughts . exactly they are generic names front companies each transaction goes through dozens of them hidden dozens of times "
55199	55236	55195	55195	you	0	" said Freddie . He had opened a copied set of the detail windows in the air before him and was qwerting madly . She tried to follow his progress . He talked while he qwerted . “
55346	55352	55337	55337	you	1736	" He looked at her . “
55433	55440	55441	55441	she	1739	“ Where did it come from ? "
55444	55450	55441	55441	she	1739	“ What ? His paranoia ? "
55451	55459	55420	55421	Scott Westerfeld	235	“ No , Freddie . His money . "
55460	55468	55420	55421	Scott Westerfeld	235	“ How the fuck should I know ? "
55469	55486	55441	55441	she	1739	“ Can you trace it back to whoever gave it to him ? '' she asked . "
55515	56212	55420	55421	Scott Westerfeld	235	" He turned back to the display hovering in the air above them . He and Sam began qwerting again , their desktops growing over with unruly hordes of green and blue transaction windows . They seemed to have turned their attention to a single transaction , tracing it through the maze of custodians between Bonito and its final goal . Freddie was muttering as he worked , oblivious to her presence . Her understanding became unfocused as she watched , her mind losing track of the individual commands they performed . She disabled her Eyemouse Help . There was a slow , cycling pattern to the play of fingers and virtual light , a repetition of the same series of steps as they followed the money from one transaction to the next . Apparently they had embarked upon some sort of brute force search , like taking every possible route in a maze to find the end . She was reminded of Freddie 's search for Candy , culling the huge database for matches with the few clues they 'd had . But this database was astronomically larger ; opaque with all the muddy footprints of capital . She remembered when the Public Access to Securities Act had been passed five years before . Bankers , brokers , and civil libertarians had all wrung their hands over the threat to privacy . But the other side had won ; taxpayers were sick of bailing out looted thrifts and banks , investors sick of finding out their stocks were worthless . So the new rules made it posPOLYMORPH 163 sible for individuals to audit almost any legal transaction . She looked at the multihued galaxy around them . It had n't done much good . The profusion of data made finding anything impossible . A Times editorial had compared PASA research with taking a micrograph of every cell in someone 's head and then using the data to sketch the person 's face . There had to be a better way . When she and Freddie had tried to find Candy , the most obvious clue had been staring them in the face , and they 'd gotten lost in minutiae . She decided to let Sam and Freddie continue until the search had almost exhausted them . When they were malleable enough to take a new tack , she would suggest another course . She drank tea , waiting . Sam 's eyes grew heavy - lidded , either from fatigue or in a meditative trance . Freddie 's muttering got harsher as his throat dried . Her barley tea grew cold and bitter , the leaves on the bottom of the cup a sickly mass of green . Freddie refilled his own tea with inhuman frequency . He must have a bladder the size of a basketball , she thought . As an hour crept by , punctuated only by the tiny snicks of qwerting , he developed a tick in one eye . She stood and moved behind his chair , putting a hand on one shoulder . He did not respond . Sam was a slower qwerter than Freddie . The windows and dialogue boxes that littered the air before him moved more deliberately , without the pyrotechnic flutter that Freddie 's had . But his concentration was more intense . He sometimes toggled among a small stack of windows like a nervous card player shuffling his hand . The time he paused before each little cluster of information was minuscule . Absentmindedly , she grasped Sam 's shoulders , felt the muscles and bone . They were as tense as Freddie 's , but the muscles were taut all the way across 164 Scott Westerfeld .. ......... ..................... - the shoulders , whereas Freddie 's were bunched in knots . She rubbed them lightly . He seemed more fragile than Freddie , and she felt intrusive touching him . The muscles relaxed a little , though his qwerting did n't slow . After a few moments he turned his head a little and looked at her malformed hand . She said , “
56218	56304	56216	56216	you	1740	" He must have detected her voice through the tight contact between hands and collarbone . He wiggled a finger , bringing forward her dialog window , her words time - stamped to show that she had just uttered them . no came his answer . I m used to defects if I may call it that my deafness is also congenital She did n't explain that the mutation was merely a whim . She stopped rubbing but left her hands on Sam 's shoulders . “
56320	56341	56314	56314	Freddie	257	" trying to isolate a single transaction not just the PASA filing but the locus of the actual debit / credit “
56350	56369	56314	56314	Freddie	257	" no but it shows us where the decisions are made so we can monitor all his transactions easily “

56424	56455	56314	56314	Freddie	257	" your friend Bonito is probably asleep of course his operating system is handling his affairs for most people , you must remember capital is the province of machines of algorithms “
56470	56478	56480	56480	I	0	” you are vanishingly rare in that regard “
56487	56730	56480	56480	I	0	" it is She resumed her massage , occasionally interrupting his work to ask a question . The shift from desktop manipulation to conversation did n't seem to break his concentration . His short , haiku - like answers were clear and direct . Apparently , his disability had trained him to make the most of few words . Sam 's labors gradually began to make sense to her . One window , always forward , showed the logical shape of the single transaction they had been tracing . As another hour dragged on , it grew into a twisted mass in the air before her , an impossible , Escherlike structure . Bonito had wound his finances into a dense and 166 Scott Westerfeld recursive forest of loops . Wherever they followed the maze of transaction , their path wrapped back onto itself , juggling their calculations , the different windows failing to add up . Sam explained that Bonito 's operating system was buying and selling short the same shares of mutual funds almost simultaneously , hiding still other transactions in the welter of balance adjustments that the self - negating credits and debits incurred . After another half hour , Sam stopped qwerting . He hung his head . Freddie went on another few minutes , then stopped . There was a moment of silence . Then came the snick of Sam 's qwerting . this has been quite instructive "
56745	56763	56734	56734	you	1742	" Freddie sighed . at this point I would n't be surprised if that were Bonito 's employer “

56873	56911	56841	56841	She	1742	“ But we ca n't even get his name from a numbered account . That 's what Swiss Nodes are for . Even the bank does n't know his name . It 's all accessed by codes . "
56912	56964	56841	56841	She	1742	“ Not his name , Freddie , or his address or his Social POLYMORPH 1 167 Security number . But what he is . He 's got all this money . So what 's the story behind it ? What 's he doing with it ? What does it mean ? '' "

'' I think maybe you should forget the status bytes and the parity checks and all that little shit . Look at the big picture . "
57081	57092	57093	57093	Freddie	257	" Like ... how much money has he made tonight ? "
57108	57120	57105	57105	he	257	“ He 's lost money , actually . A few thousand . "

57143	57169	57141	57141	Freddie	257	“ We ca n't even tell what he 's buying or selling . We do n't know what he 's doing , much less why . "

57331	57340	57341	57341	Sam	254	“ Does it correlate to some other account ? "
57352	57375	57349	57349	Freddie	257	“ There are millions of accounts open to PASA interrogation . Even Sam 's system would take years to check them all . "
57379	57409	57349	57349	Freddie	257	“ Sorry , Sam . Anyway , I do n't think we want to cast that wide a net . Even checking the Fortune 5000 would take an hour . "
57413	57451	57310	57310	him	257	" For a fuzzy search ? Bullshit . You 'd have to leave a lot of leeway for a loose correlation . It would take at least forty - five minutes . ' under 10 minutes , Freddie “

57463	57656	57310	57310	him	257	" done Another window opened , and Sam and Freddie started to define their correlation . They argued over the details . She lifted the visor and rubbed her eyes . Obviously Bonito still had the upper hand . Perhaps pursuing him was foolish . He was too powerful , too vicious . Possibly their probing had already alerted him . She felt the weight of the last week intensely . Finding Bonito had changed her landscape . Now , only a few days into this new existence , she was very tired . Her cloak of anonymity had been a precious thing , but perhaps it was n't lost forever . She could leave here tomorrow , find a new and remote existence . Or maybe the best thing to do would be to fade back into the Lower East Side and create a new persona , never sporting mutated hands again . Sam and Freddie , laughing as they set some final variable , concluded negotiations on their bet . Freddie stood , done for the night . The wild goose chase was over . He flipped up his visor . "
57676	57780	57349	57349	Freddie	257	" He turned toward Sam as he said the last words , mouthing them with exaggerated clarity . But Sam was n't looking at Freddie 's lips or dialog window . There was suddenly an awestruck expression on Sam 's face . His eyes were focused into the virtual middle distance . Freddie flipped his visor down . She did the same . There was a correlation . Under the window that showed Bonito 's balance , another had appeared . It bore the same red dot , rising and falling identically . In the supertitle of the new window was one word : “

Any fourteen - yearold hacker could 've figured that out . But Milica has medical records that patently do not match your body . So where did her body come from ? I told him I met a woman with hands that were different . Now you show up , but only one of your hands is different . You 've managed to make enemies with this Bonito , an Americorp hit man or whatever . Is this normal ? He keeps asking me who the hell you are , what the 184 Scott Westerfeld a lot quick of red came as in the VR clear . After hell you are , and all I can say is I ca n't tell him . "

64394	64413	64379	64379	she	1918	“ Hardly . It dates from the eighteenth century , when people appreciated what opera was all about . "

Over the next ten minutes , the women slowly lost their lead . 192 Scott Westerfeld She lifted the palemoscope and focused on the box across from them . Shielded from the glare on the stage , her eyes adjusted to the darkness . King 's box was close to the glitter of the stage , and he was clearer now . She recognized him from Candy . She leaned back to Freddie . “

She took the lead , assuming an air of confidence . They followed the curve of the hallway toward the other side of the opera house . Halfway there , they reached a crush of audience members exiting the mezzanine . There were soft mutters of recognition around them . A few people caught her eye and smiled . She smiled back . She calmed a rush of adrenaline , an unfamiliar exhilaration as the crowd parted before them . Fame . Suddenly a man was in their way , his face alight . He grasped Lee 's hands in his . "
67875	67913	67873	67873	Hillary	276	" A German accent . A seductive smile . Lee turned her fear into a smile and leaned forward into his offered hug . His hair was slicked back with something that smelled like lemon . POLYMORPH 199 "
67921	67952	67919	67919	Hillary	276	" he said , his eyes sweeping down her . She looked down at the Mylar dress , afraid to speak . She had made no changes to her voice . "
67962	68030	67957	67957	Hillary	276	" He laughed , joined by a few other people arrayed a step behind him . Like him , they were dressed in well - pressed black : suits , boxnecks , evening dresses . One of the women looked like a man in drag . Lee forced herself to laugh along with them . Freddie put his hand on her arm and started to say something . “
68044	68068	68069	68069	I	0	” the German interrupted . He stepped a little to the side , his arm extending like a game - show host 's . "
68073	68085	68069	68069	I	0	” she said , her voice coming out crisp and tight , "
68097	68169	68087	68087	I	0	” His smile stayed on his face , but something behind his eyes crumpled like a house of cards . He made a little rubbing gesture with the fingers of his extended hand , as if he was trying to remember a name , a phone number , a simple word that was somehow eluding his grasp . He started to speak again . Freddie 's grasp tightened as he said , "
68176	68376	68170	68171	Ms. Wilson	264	” He pulled her free of the little knot of embarrassed faces . She smiled as they moved out of her way . One of the women smiled back , a twinkle in her eye as if she 'd won a bet . Lee felt a rush of strange pleasure . It was the delight of illicit power . She 'd had a girlfriend once who could get bogus smartcards , and the feeling reminded her of the thrill of charging a purchase on one . But this was much more visceral . She guessed it was something Bonito would understand . They moved quickly through the rest of the crowd . She glanced back at Freddie . He was ashen . His hand still grasped her arm , as if for support . They reached a series of doors set flush into the 200 Scott Westerfeld He put antly . He hading , smilingered in h curved hallway , deep mahogany like the one that led to their box . A pair of suits flanked one . Freddie cleared his throat . Their expressions did n't change . He started to speak , but instead his grasp tightened . "
68382	68386	68379	68380	Hillary Wilson	276	” Lee said . “
68396	68426	68393	68394	Mr. King	240	" One suit looked at the other , his eyebrow raised . The shorter one 's face bore a look of recognition . He made a little half bow . "
68434	68604	68393	68394	Mr. King	240	" he said . He had a corporate accent as smooth as a CitiBank machine 's . He put a finger in one ear and muttered something almost silently . He had a bead in the other ear . He listened intently , nodding , smiling politely when he caught her eye . Confirmation flickered in his face . As they were ushered inside , the other suit waved his hand just behind her , at the periphery of vision . Something in the hand chirped a little , probably at the brass fittings on the palemoscope around her neck . Two more suits inside stood shoulder to shoulder , shielding King from her view . They smiled politely and waited for a signal from the guard with the metal detector . Then they parted . Behind them was King . He looked older than he had at Candy . In the yellow incandescent houselights , his boyish features were showing their age . But his enthusiasm was undimmed . "
68611	68630	68606	68606	God	259	” were the first words out of his mouth . It was n't the greeting she 'd expected . “
68639	68666	68636	68636	you	2018	" He pointed meaningfully at the paper notebook on his lap . It was covered in a welter of scrawls , looping curves in several colors . “
68679	68732	68668	68668	I	0	" POLYMORPH 201 He seemed desperately to need an answer . The silence grew , second by second . She held her hand out for the notebook . Maybe somewhere on it was a legible word , a drawing , any clue at all . He handed it over eagerly , saying , "
68768	69077	68761	68761	I	0	" He was waiting for a look of understanding from her . Beneath several layers of swirls and loops of ink , she saw a grid , eight - by - eight , a diagram of the opera set . Over the grid , the movements of the singers had been traced , elaborated , extrapolated . She gathered that each color was one singer , though there seemed to be too many colors . She pretended to study it carefully , nodding her head and biting her lower lip as she 'd seen Wilson do . King waited expectantly . He was chewing a thin plastic pen whose end was ringed with a color dial . It was a cheap item , popular with kids a couple of years before . The diagram staggered her . This was how King had seen the opera : chaos to be mapped and domesticated . She had looked for the pattern herself , but it seemed intentionally overcomplicated - as if to resist determined analysis , forcing attention onto other issues . She had let her intuition predict the movement of the singers , concentrating on the waning fortunes of the women rather than the rules of motion . But the pattern had been no match for King and his multicolored pen . Beside the scrawls that recorded the performers ' raw movements , a set of formulae had been inscribed . The handwriting was minuscule ; letters , numbers , flowcharting rubric , all neatly boxed and marked with symbols vaguely familiar from Senior Logic . On the facing page , numerous precursors to ye The On the opelooked 202 Scott Westerfeld these final formulae had been scrawled and scratched out . Christ , she thought , how did he have time to watch ? She cleared her throat . “
69083	69100	68761	68761	I	0	" she calmly disagreed . Out of the corner of her eye , Freddie looked horrified . “
69103	69107	69108	69112	the girl at the end	2019	" King blustered , "
69152	69190	69213	69213	I	0	" He pulled the notebook back out of her hand and looked at it again , his head nodding a little as if checking old and certain facts . Maybe all his doodles had discovered something interesting . "
69198	69202	69213	69213	I	0	" she asked . “
69209	69210	69213	69213	I	0	" "
69253	69290	69296	69296	she	2019	" He asked the question almost desperately . She knew the answer right away , as surely as if she really were Wilson . But she let the moment linger . Then she smiled and said , “
69305	69345	69296	69296	she	2019	" His face stayed blank for a moment , and he looked almost dumb as the thought sank in . Then the liveliness in his features , the sure intelligence , returned , and he broke into a grin . "
69349	69353	69346	69347	Ms. Wilson	264	" he said , "
69362	69363	69355	69355	you	264	" "
69366	69425	69355	69355	you	264	" She took the seat next to him , leaving Freddie standing . He retreated a step , giving them a small area of privacy . She took the notebook back and spread it open across her knees , caressing the sprawling loops . She could feel the incisions of the penned lines in the heavy bond paper . “
69436	69440	69429	69429	you	240	” she said . “
69447	69460	69461	69461	I	0	” He fondled the plastic color POLYMORPH 203 Shoverned and watch somassed . “
69467	69485	69486	69486	She	264	" Really a marvelous piece of technology : open architecture , pen - based , low power . ”

69517	69520	69521	69521	he	240	" What ? "
69524	69572	69521	69521	he	240	" That my soprano flies away from a danger that 's not real . Well , it 's very real , but not as imminent as it looks . I really did n't think anyone would figure out the pattern . Not on opening night , anyway . ”
69579	69610	69573	69573	He	240	“ ' It 's a curse , really . I ca n't just sit and watch something so exquisitely ... rule - governed and not try to figure it out . "

69815	69837	69841	69841	he	240	“ Damn . I wish Sean were here . She 's much better at catching that kind of stuff than me . "
69970	69974	69975	69975	she	264	“ Sean Bayes ? "
69978	69981	69975	69975	she	264	“ Yes . "
69986	69991	69982	69982	He	240	" You know her ? "
69992	70004	69963	69963	King	240	" I admire her work , but we 've never met . "
70005	70033	69963	69963	King	240	" That 's wonderful ! She really would have been here tonight , except . . . she 's working on a new show , you see . "
70034	70046	69982	69982	He	240	" I 've heard . Supposedly , it 's quite secret . ”
70047	70069	69963	69963	King	240	“ Not really . Sean just does n't like to work in all the publicity that I 've created for her . "
70070	70081	69963	69963	King	240	" I 'd love to see the work in progress . ”
70082	70092	69982	69982	He	240	" Really ? Let me introduce you , then . ”
70149	70168	70145	70145	King	240	“ Ms. Wilson , would you do me the honor of watching the second act from my box ? "

71769	71854	71702	71702	Freddie	257	" Right , and she complains to the press that they interviewed an impostor . So it 's a big story . Or Bonito sees it on TV .

The cab was a new Ford that smelled of tobacco smoke and cleaning solvents . The wipers arced grime and wet streaks that blinked mercury - vapor orange under the struts of Manhattan Bridge . The driver , a small Hispanic woman dwarfed behind the Ford 's steering wheel , passed back a handful of tissues wordlessly . Freddie blotted his nose clean with a wad of them , holding his head back . Lee cradled him against her shoulder . She and the driver talked about the rain , drifting back and forth between English and Spanish . As they approached home , she dug money out of Freddie 's pocket . The meter had hit twenty even , and she tipped the driver with the few dollars she had left of her own money . Freddie fumbled with the keys at the outside door and seemed unsteady on the stairs . Upon entering the apartment , he opened the refrigerator but closed it empty - handed . They showered together . More blood ran from Freddie 's nose when the water hit his face . He did n't notice . He met her eyes with a look that was intense , cautious , reticent . He seemed continually about to utious , reticentut it never camejad varied her His gaze fell to her body . She had varied her skin 216 Scott Westerfeld with the diverse textures of age ; it was here and there wrinkled or discolored . To conceal her strength , she had woven her musculature into multiple conduits : tight , dispersed cords discretely threaded among her sharp bones . Still , her body was spare and healthy looking , its surface seasoned with age . He held her , pressing tight . The water ran between them , around them , tracing the connection of their bodies . "

74147	74303	74145	74145	you	276	" She laughed , and he kissed her . They held each other until the water started to grow cool . In bed , they kissed for a long time . He explored her mouth carefully , with teeth , lips , and tongue . She realized the source of his fascination : Her lips were thinner than they had been . He was trying to measure her change , if only in this one trivial particular . The kisses lasted as her passion rose , and she pushed him down to her breasts , still sensitive in their newness . He licked them , tenderly bit . As he moved across her body , she felt a reluctance in his attentions . She moved down to kiss his shoulders , adjusting their position until she could reach his groin , ran her fingers through the soft hair above his cock . He was flaccid . "

74362	74792	74359	74359	her	2162	" There was a stab of pain , almost like a physical intrusion , in her side . Freddie was only half with her . He also lay with Hillary Wilson , in effigy . For the first time , she had stolen a body . Now came the price . Anger toward Freddie rose in her , a sense of betrayal . But there was something subtler than that , an almost imperceptible dislocation of self . The feeling was like the odd sense when a new body mimicked her in a mirror , but broader . Usually , a new body was like a new apartment , an empty shell that had to be filled before it was comfortable . But this body was already claimed , furnished with all the baggage of being Hillary Wilson . She had seen that reflected in Freddie 's eyes . Something seemed to slip away from her . Her mind tried to grasp exactly what it was , but it was too soon out of reach . She held Freddie until he fell asleep , his breathing heavy and slow against her chest , and waited for the feeling to go . new bobed her inlike the oceptible d . Teach . When she woke , Freddie was up , dressed and sitting cross - legged on the floor , drinking something from a coffee mug . He was staring at her , his eyes glazed . She reached out one leg and poked him with å toe . He smiled , blinking . Looking down at herself , she flexed her hands , the muscles in her arms and legs . The usual awkwardness of a new body was absent . In the last week , she had become physiologically accustomed to frequent changes . But she felt a physical toll . She relaxed her muscles and did an internal census of her major organs . There was a disquieting ache near her stomachs , from the place where the fire of a change usually started . À seasick feeling , so subtle that it 218 Scott Westerfeld went away when she concentrated on it . It was evident only in the peripheral vision of her mind 's eye . She reached out and took Freddie 's mug , lifted it to her lips . It was strong coffee , hot and sweet , flavored with something like hazelnut . It cleared her head . She wrapped one hand around its warmth and propped her head on the other . "
74798	74803	74796	74796	you	2163	" she asked him . "

74827	74896	74825	74825	Freddie	257	" She had picked up his habit of italicizing words . He smiled again , leaning back against the closet door . She drank , the events of the previous night going through her head . Visions from the vivid and effulgent opera colored her memories with a fantastic light . The whole evening now seemed overacted . Freddie watched her think for a while and then said , "
74903	74909	74825	74825	Freddie	257	" She had already decided . “

75030	75079	75023	75023	Sean	237	“ So , our only way to get to Bonito is through Sean . He 's only exposed while he 's stalking her . If we can warn Sean about Bonito and get her on our side , we can find him . Then we can hurt him . ”
75080	75108	75023	75023	Sean	237	“ Hurt him ? Are you serious ? Last time he fucked with us he ate fifty thousand volts and then got run over by a car . "
75109	75140	75023	75023	Sean	237	“ Merely a body thing . He changes bodies like you POLYMORPH 219 change clothes . I 'm talking about fucking up his life . Hitting him where he lives ? "

75168	75196	75164	75164	Freddie	257	" Something 's got to be important to him . Whatever is a constant for him : his plans , his home , his heart 's desire . "

75300	75339	75297	75297	her	2172	“ Freddie , I thought I was the only one , the only polymorph . Then Bonito appeared and showed me that there were more of us . He destroyed my innocence . And then he abandoned me . ”

79495	79515	79484	79484	She	276	“ He said that Sean had gone to meet me . He thought I was Bonita , of course . “
79517	79535	79484	79484	She	276	“ So they must have spoken on the phone . Sean called Bonito or Bonito called Sean . "

This was n't a user interface , like Sam 's elegant financial schematic or even the New York Public Library 's cluttered network . This was the operating system of a small , sophisticated machine , rows of numbers scrolling down the screen without any clue to their meaning . Freddie seemed at home here , though . A few minutes later , he spoke again . "

80392	80458	80384	80384	me	0	" His fingers moved into a blur . The screen rolled with text , too fast for her to follow . She looked away , her head beginning to spin again . She sat down on the bed and considered another jolt of morphine . Instead , she shut her eyes and relaxed the knotted muscles in her gut . Freddie did n't take long . "

80593	80925	80584	80588	Four - year - old	2298	” As he qwerted , she curled herself into a tight ball . The pain was duller now , but it was larger , more expansive . It had been a long time since she had thrown up involuntarily . She remembered a bad time at age twelve - five beers with an older girl who lived POLYMORPH 237 in the Gompers projects . They 'd found two six - packs hidden in a storage cage behind the laundry room and had drunk them too quickly , wary of being caught . Afterward , they 'd gone outside , where sundown pinkened the brick of the towers , the cool air beautiful to breathe in her adolescent intoxication . Then they 'd run to the swing sets . High into the air , standing , thrusting harder and harder until her hands were burning with the pattern of the chains , it had been glorious . Until they 'd stopped . The feeling had come as if from far away , a revolution fomenting in some distant province of her body . She fought it , marshaling her unformed talent against the rush of nausea , holding on far longer than her older companion . But the whole time there was a certainty in her gut that she had lost control , that her body was building toward some vast explosion . The feeling now had that same inevitable , sovereign edge . But she kept it down . Freddie talked while he worked , and she listened with half her attention as a distraction from the pain . As far as she could follow it , he opened Sean 's account easily , pretending to be an audit warrant from the Phone Harassment Complaints Bureau . He verified the audit request with the chip from Sean 's phone itself , and the last 1024 numbers that had called her rolled by , time - stamped and fully open to interrogation . “

81756	81782	81784	81784	you	2311	" Freddie picked up the roll of money wordlessly . He went to the door . His hand on the knob , he turned back . "
81787	82082	81784	81784	you	2311	" While he was gone , she searched the apartment for other weapons . She figured that a gun could knock 240 Scott Westerfeld Bonito down , but killing him would be a different story . She had no idea what it took to halt a polymorph 's metabolism . She could empty the gun into his head , but he might have rearranged his vital organs . She had considered developing a backup for her own autonomic functions but had n't known where to begin . With Bonito 's powers , he might have a spare medulla oblongata , distributed brain tissue , a whole extra braincase ; anything was possible . The point was to kill him good . On the kitchen table she arrayed Freddie 's stun gun , a spray bottle of 7 molar D - Con rat poison , a ten - pound maglight , the trench knife . Bonito was expendable now . She 'd realized it since Freddie had soaked the NYNEX mainframe . The CANDY account had given them only a thin sliver of connection to Bonito . Now they had him cold . Freddie could compile a history of his movements , his phone calls , his finances ; somewhere in the ocean of data had to be a trail that led to another polymorph . Even if every lead turned up dry , she could still wait in his house , with his face . Sooner or later , some polymorph friend of his would come by . She did n't need him to find the rest of her kind . He was in the way . The thought calmed her pain . She was contemplating the array of weapons when Freddie came back . "
82085	82093	81784	81784	you	2311	" he said , surveying the table . “

82106	82155	81784	81784	you	2311	" He pulled it out of the crumpled paper bag in his hand . It was about thirty centimeters long , with a snub nose and a magazine grip that was longer than the gun itself . There was a spare magazine taped upside down on the grip . "

82294	82300	82274	82274	She	2319	“ There a safety catch ? "
82301	82304	82305	82305	She	2319	" No . "

82706	82724	82703	82703	she	2330	“ Maybe with my Sony and some extra hardware , say about a thousand dollars ' worth . "

82729	82752	82684	82684	Freddie	257	" Probably should download the manual for the scanner off the net and spend a couple of days reading it , though . "
82753	82762	82763	82763	she	2330	" I will take that as a no , "
82814	82823	82824	82824	she	2330	" You sure you disabled the alarm system ? "

86652	86664	86648	86648	He	240	“ Just tell me this : Who do you work for ? "
86665	86674	86582	86582	He	240	“ No one . I 'm on welfare . "
86691	86720	86684	86684	he	240	" I am doing this myself because you are , or seemed to be , a friend of Sean 's . I have professional interrogators at my disposal . "

86908	86955	86902	86902	He	240	“ It 's some kind of accelerated clone . Obviously , you were going to fake her death and provide a body . But you were n't finished . You had n't gotten around to constructing fingerprints or retinas yet . Our question is , Why ? "
86985	86990	86976	86976	King	240	“ Sean is dead . "
86991	86998	86999	86999	he	240	" I just talked to her , "
87047	87057	87043	87043	She	191	" What you talked to was a ... doppelgänger . "
87058	87065	87017	87017	his	240	“ A doppelgänger ? How quaint . "
87066	87085	87086	87086	He	240	" It wo n't be very quaint when it gets through being Sean and decides to doppelgäng you . "
87091	87111	87088	87088	his	240	" ' This is ridiculous . I just talked to Sean , and she 's on her way here . "
87115	87143	87112	87112	She	191	" The person on his way here is Bonito . He can change himself into any form . I know , because I can change myself too . "
87186	87193	87194	87194	he	240	" Maybe we should talk later , "
87197	87200	87201	87201	she	191	“ Wait ! "
87227	87231	87232	87232	she	191	" I was — "
87244	87267	87268	87268	King	240	“ The last singer , in Wilson 's opera , she did n't really have to escape . It was a discrepancy . "
87315	87328	87329	87329	Her	191	“ Mr. King , she was just sick of the whole thing . "
87372	87401	87360	87360	She	191	“ That 's why she flew away . Like I said , there POLYMORPH 257 was really no discrepancy at all . She was just sick of it . "
87406	87421	87402	87402	He	240	" I guess I still do n't understand . The opera , I mean . "
87437	87444	87428	87428	his	240	“ What the fuck are you ? "
87445	87455	87456	87456	They	2463	" ' I do n't know , Mr. King . "
87465	87472	87473	87473	he	240	" We know you 're different , ”
87476	87499	87473	87473	he	240	“ ' Your heart rate is abnormally slow , your blood pressure way too low . We thought it was the drug . "

The chair you 're sitting in can take your heart rate , body temperature , blood pressure , can measure and analyze your sweat . We know you 're on some kind of opiate . It 's rampant in your perspiration . If you put your hand on the table , I can even tell you if you 're lying . "
87610	87615	87616	87616	she	191	" Sean is dead , "
87640	87655	87656	87656	She	191	" When the drug wears off , we can get a more accurate reading . "

87676	87683	87670	87670	he	2465	" Did you kill Hillary Wilson ? "

87742	87765	87766	87766	Sean	237	" King looked away from her suddenly , into the middle distance at the other end of the connection . 258 Scott Westerfeld "
87770	87787	87766	87766	Sean	237	" He stood , his head grotesquely attenuated by the upper limit of the projection area . "
87793	88031	87791	87791	Sean	237	" she said , but he was gone . The table stepped down , went dark . He had n't seen the forest . Chapter 14 Teeth An hour later , she decided to sleep . The phones in the chair armrests were all dead . She 'd pushed the hard icons on all the control panels in the room . There was no response , no way to get a line out . She curled up on the thick shag under the table , the fetal position containing and comforting the pain in her gut . It did n't even feel like pain anymore . It was an insistent presence , but it did n't hurt . It was an intrusion , like the dull bass throb from a stereo in another apartment . But it had no pulse , did not change . It seemed to be waiting . Finally , she slept despite it . She woke to fear . Someone was in the room . Not telepresent but standing at the open door . It closed , quietly . The intruder 's feet looked like a woman 's . They walked to the table and halfway around it . Lee remained silent , letting adrenaline build slowly in her , trying to keep control . Then the woman knelt . It was Sean 's face , close in the darkness below the table . "
88037	88109	88110	88110	Darling	2468	” Bonita 's smile had n't changed . Suddenly , the space under the table seemed horrifyingly small . Lee rolled out , away from Bonita . They both stood , across the table from each other . 260 Scott Westerfeld Lee screamed . It was piercing and inhumanly loud . She took a ragged breath and reformed her larynx slightly , then screamed again , louder still . Bonita smiled . “
88139	88181	88182	88182	You	2468	" Lee filled her lungs , expanding them flush against the limits of her rib cage , and screamed again . Her larynx was torn by the cry . Someone must have heard . Bonita put a finger to her chin . "
88226	88236	88182	88182	You	2468	” She said the last word with bared teeth . “
88242	88279	88182	88182	You	2468	" She shrugged . Lee tried to scream again but lost control of her breathing . She began to cough — deep , brutal spasms from the bottom of her lungs . Someone must have heard . “
88287	88339	88182	88182	You	2468	" Lee slowly regained her breath . She spat into one of the leather chairs . Her lungs were under control now , but she could n't scream again . She turned her concentration to her hands . A fire built in them , branching from the palms toward the fingertips . "
88428	88432	88426	88426	I	0	" Bonita smirked . “
88445	88466	88468	88468	you	2477	" Her eyes were filled with delight POLYMORPH 261 Lee cleared her throat and spoke , her voice breaking raggedly . “
88470	88481	88468	88468	you	2477	" Bonita leaned forward , hands flat against the table . “
88485	88512	88468	88468	you	2477	" Lee felt the change realize , cartilage extending out from each finger , sharpening . She smiled back at Bonita and cleared her throat again . “
88520	89246	88518	88518	bitch	2478	” Bonita moved a second before the words were out . There was no flicker of warning , no slight drop to show that her knees had bent . Just a smooth , effortless bound over the table . Lee watched her reaction from a strange remove , morphine , adrenaline , and instinct making a distant spectacle of it . She threw one hand between them , a sideways blow that sliced across Bonita 's neck . The newly formed claws opened up the flesh , and blood spouted from Bonita 's jugular . Bonita struck her with arms outstretched , the full force of her bound behind the blow . Lee was thrown back against the window , the breath knocked out of her . Then Bonita was upon her , a terrible force pinning her chest and limbs . Bonita 's face was only a few centimeters away . Blood spurted from the torn flesh for a few slow heartbeats . It soaked through Lee 's coverall , warm against her skin . Bonita giggled , the sound bubbling in her throat . In seconds , the wound had healed itself . Bonita forced them toward the floor . Her body , sized to Sean 's petite frame , seemed to weigh too much . They slid together down the window , smearing blood behind them , Lee 's legs powerless to keep her standing . Her arms were crushed against her sides . Her claws flexed uselessly . She closed her eyes and tried to focus for another change . The fire came quickly , caressing the muscles and bone of her jaw . She made 262 Scott Westerfeld her teeth longer and sharper than she ever had before , extending the canines until she tasted the salty warmth of her own blood , then hardened the tissue inside her mouth until the bleeding stopped They had reached the floor . Bonita 's body was wrapped around her like an octopus . Their faces were close , Bonita 's breath hot . Lee felt a warm , tender kiss on her cheek , then another on her closed mouth . The kisses were slow and long , Bonita 's lips wet and throbbing . The lips were inhumanly prehensile , pulsating with a wormlike inner motion as they caressed her neck . Eyes still closed , Lee turned her face toward the lips , responding as well as her stiffened facial skin would allow . The kisses became heavier . Lee parted her lips and felt a long , hot tongue venture into her mouth . She suppressed a gag as it slipped deep into her throat . She bit . Bonita 's body stiffened . Lee turned her head to the side , tearing out the last few strands of muscle and spitting the tongue out , gagging . It had writhed , disconnected , for a moment in her mouth . Lee turned back to Bonita and realized with horror that her face was beatific : eyes closed , the picture of pleasure , blood dripping from one corner of her mouth . Lee felt panic take her . She thrashed her limbs in a useless frenzy and strained her head forward to bite Bonita 's face . Her fangs found purchase in the cheek , tearing another mouthful of flesh . Bonita 's eyes opened as she screamed and rose from the floor . She stumbled back , one hand over the gaping hole in her face , and fell into a chair beside the conference table . Lee sprang to her feet , claws and fangs ready . Bonita 's body was like a fluid , reforming in some liquid dance almost too fast to see . It shifted from a bulky , indefinite mass to a long - limbed creature . Lee POLYMORPH 263 took a step back as it moved forward . Bonito 's fist swung out , in an inhumanly fast roundhouse , and struck the side of her face . There was a moment of blackout , and Lee felt herself falling . She came to as Bonita lifted her from the floor . Her vision blurred at the sight of Bonita 's ghastly ruin of a face . The words were slurred . “
89259	89584	89255	89255	you	2479	” Blood sprayed with every syllable . Bonita seemed to be weakening . Her eyes were glassy . Lee shook herself free and stepped back , her head still reeling . Bonita was pulling her own shirt off . Lee tried to thrust a claw toward Bonita 's throat , but her arms did n't respond . Bonita easily parried the blow and shoved her backward . Lee was thrown onto the table , her head snapping back to hit the hard wood . The pain was a white light in her brain . Her morphine organ shifted into full gear , out of control . Her head began to swim with hallucinations , and she gave herself a rush of adrenaline and endorphins to keep her mind together . She felt Bonita cover her again . She was powerless to resist . Bonita pulled her limbs akimbo , holding her wrists with steely hands , her ankles in prehensile , grasping talons . A coarse tentacle wound itself around her neck , tightening just enough to brighten the pain in her head . Lee could open only one eye . The other was shut by swelling from Bonita 's blow . Lee felt other extremities at work , ripping her coverall apart unhurriedly . One of her cheeks seemed to have a hole in it , torn by her own fangs when Bonita had struck her . Bonita 's facial wound still gaped , but the bleeding had stopped . Her skin was ghastly white , as though she had withdrawn the blood flow from her face entirely . Lee could glimpse bone through the hole . She thrust upward to bite again , but the tentacle 264 Scott Westerfeld whipped her head back against the table . It stayed tight for a few moments , until red clouds formed at the edges of her vision . It relaxed before she passed out . "
89594	90178	89591	89591	you	2468	” came the slurred words . As Lee gasped for breath , she felt something . It was subtle , at the threshold of awareness . The table was purring beneath them . She turned her head toward the projection well , and the tentacle reflexively tightened . Before redness clouded her vision again , she saw a faint glow in the well . The table had booted . Bonita was oblivious to it . She had pressed her body against Lee , her face as white as death . Lee could see that the tentacle around her neck emerged from Bonita 's chest . Another had formed between his legs . He had stripped , and Lee 's clothes lay in rags around her . The penetration came , oddly tentative . The member was thin , sinuous , ribbed like a cheap bodega condom . She felt its corded length slip slowly into her , then branch into distinct threads . They probed her with a strange tenderness , growing finer as they split and split again , exploring ever wider as if to exhaust the spaces inside her . She wrenched her vaginal muscles trying to expel the tentacle , but it was too strong . Lee 's face and head throbbed from their injuries , and she closed her eyes and focused her pain into her groin . She began to strengthen her vagina , stealing muscle from her thighs , her back , impressing into sinew the flesh of her buttocks . She took shards of bone from her pelvis and began to set them into the hard new muscles . Bonito 's flowering cock slid forth nervous tissue . It began to fuse with Lee 's nerves , first in her vagina , then penetrating deeper ; her stomachs , solar plexus , Ondom . Sheth into distince growing POLYMORPH 265 spinal column . As his nervous pattern imprinted itself on hers , she began to feel Bonito 's pleasure . It was wholly unlike the glow of her morphine buzz or any sexual pleasure she had ever felt . It was as flat and sharp as an Arctic wind ; it blew across a broad and empty place . In the mind 's eye of her morphine fugue , she was vividly there , in his pleasure . It was intense , brutal , barren . He was working his own change inside her . The disaggregated cock had merged into a few strands , which forced their way farther inside her . They reached for her solar plexus , the seat of her pain . Somehow , he had taken control of her body . Her abdominal organs shifted aside as his cock approached its goal . For a moment , the change in her groin was stalled . She fought his advance , straining to weave more muscles around the base of his cock . But his intrusion surged forward again , deep enough to interfere with her breathing , and the change was halted . He reached his goal inside her . His branching cocks grasped the ball of her pain like fingers . The nervous connection expanded , until she could feel him from the inside , a ghost body on top of hers , like the phantom of an amputated limb . She felt his hot , corrupt breath on her face again . Against her will , her eyes opened . "
90183	90318	90321	90321	him	2481	" the dead face said . His cock 's grasp tightened and began to draw her out . She would die now , she knew . Trying to speak seemed to mean nothing . Her awareness of her own body was diminishing . The ghost sensation of Bonito became stronger . She felt his chill pleasure increase , rising toward orgasm . Her hands clenched , fighting the pleasure . The claws cut into her palms . She focused her will on them , commanding them to close tighter , to wound ghost steps of peak ser 266 Scott Westerfeld ing from an box of superta did so instinctives effect her deeper . She felt him feel the pain , and they gasped together . For a moment , she found her own voice . “
90328	90755	90323	90323	He	2481	" she whispered . Bonito 's eyes opened . There was a look of suspicion in their glassy depths . The door slid open . She closed her own eyes , saw through Bonito 's . Two men with guns , leveled at his head . One started to say something . Bonito screamed . She felt the scream bubble up from his throat , rising from an organ between larynx and glottis , a mutated voice box of supertaut folds . Bonito 's ears closed as it began , and hers did so instinctively , but still the screech was deafening , punishing . Its effect on the guards was paralytic . One went to his knees , the other fell as he tried to back out of the room . She had once heard a FEMA cruiser let loose a paralyzing blast from its crowd - control siren during the riots . In the close and soundproofed room , Bonito 's scream was exponentially more disabling . But for a moment , she was free . The new muscles in her vagina pulled tight with wrenching force , their leverage against her pelvis threatening to snap it . The shards of bone she had teethed them with cut hard into Bonito 's cock , tearing at its knotted flesh . His pain doubled back through their nervous connection . It was blinding , shattering , and she reveled in it , pulling her muscles tighter . His scream had cut short with her first contraction , dying on his lips with a startled gag . She opened her eyes . Above her , his mouth was still wide . In it , fangs were forming , long and sharp , his jaw slackening as its bone was hurriedly depleted for them . The tentacle around her throat uncoiled and wrapped around her head , slamming sideways to expose her neck to his bite . POLYMORPH 267 She wrenched herself with one final contraction . The feedback of his pain stopped . The connection , his control , was cut . His cock was sundered . At the same moment , a spray of bullets hit his head . The gun was less than a meter from him , firing again and again . His skull shattered , he was thrown off her onto the floor . The man was one of King 's guards from the opera . His face was ashen . He dropped the gun and put a hand on her shoulder . "
90759	90780	90323	90323	He	2481	" he said . She fought to speak , feeling air and blood escape from the hole in her cheek . “
90784	90803	90323	90323	He	2481	" she whispered . She grasped his arm and pulled him closer , forced her tongue to move . “
90809	90968	90323	90323	He	2481	" His eyes widened , and he was pulled from her grasp , disappearing below the edge of the table . His screams seemed sadly faint after Bonito 's paralyzing screech . She sat up . Her abdomen felt bloated with Bonito 's riven cock . She grasped the gun . It was like the one Freddie had given her , but the magazine was longer . The other guard had fled . Somewhere , an alarm was ringing The struggle under the table had n't lasted long . She found she could pull herself into a kneeling position . The alarm cut off , and it was eerily silent . She jerked her head one way and then another , trying to see in all directions . The room began to spin in a waltz of pain , morphine , and adrenaline . Then , at the head of the table , Ed King resolved into focus . "
90976	90993	90323	90323	He	2481	” he said calmly . She clenched her wounded cheek shut with angry teeth and said , “
91002	91007	91009	91009	I	0	" och 268 Scott Westerfeld "
91027	91040	91024	91024	Sean	237	" She spat blood and started to speak , but he interrupted . “
91048	92258	91024	91024	Sean	237	” Two tentacles came over the table edge , long and spined with cartilaginous teeth . She pulled the trigger again and again as they scuttled toward her , chips flying from the dark wood of the table . One tentacle split as a bullet hit it and drew back , broken . The other wrapped around her waist , its hooked thorns tearing her flesh . She did n't resist . She threw herself over the side toward it , clutching the pistol . Bonito had repaired his face enough to show surprise when she landed beside him . He had normal arms as well as his tentacles , a taser wand in one . The right side of his mouth was still fanged , but the left had been shattered . His head was lopsided , half blown away . She did n't waste time with his head . She put four bullets into his chest , just to push him away . He dropped the taser . She pointed the gun at his solar plexus , at the place he had reached for inside her , and squeezed the trigger hard . It went fully automatic . When help arrived , she was bent over his bloody form , recharging the taser wand and thrusting it into his wounds one by one . CHAPTER 15 Ambulance She did n't dare pass out . The concussions were bad enough to kill her . She dealt with them slowly and surely , after she 'd stopped all the external bleeding she could find . King had told the paramedics not to touch her . She was in an Americorp limo , headed toward a Jersey City hospital . At first she had hallucinated that Freddie was beside her . But it was another man , old for a paramedic , who held her hand as she healed herself . His eyes were glassy with shock . He must have seen the boardroom . She laughed softly to herself . She was reducing her morphine level slowly but was still hopped up . She now realized that at some point during her battle with Bonito , she 'd had a mild overdose . The new muscles in her vagina took only minutes to force the remains of Bonito 's cock out . Repairing her groin , she discovered a hairline fracture in her pelvis from the stress of her final contraction . Two ribs had been broken at some point , and several teeth were missing from her mouth , snapped off in their thinned and sharpened state . The internal organs of her abdomen were a mess . Bonito 's efforts there had been even more brutal than she 'd realized . One stomach was collapsed , her spinal column was low on fluid , and the walls of her vagina and uterus were badly torn . 270 Scott Westerfeld But the changes came with an ease she 'd never known before . The fierce pain of change had been replaced by a fluidness , her body shifting facilely beneath the bloody sheet across her . The damage she 'd sustained did n't lessen the pleasure her new powers brought her . She was lightened by the realization that her body meant nothing . What was it Bonito had written ? The shock of massive trauma brought it to me . She lay there , exploring the splendid mobility of organs and tissues , the exquisite arbitrariness of form . This is what Bonito had found , or had always possessed : a pristine detachment from the trauma of discarding oneself . And finally , there was respite from the pain in her gut . It was as if the hot center of change at her solar plexus had exploded , spreading throughout her body . In its absence , a coolness covered her mind , like a blanket of snow . By the time they reached the hospital , she was fit enough to make a run for it . They had to use a taser to bring her down . The shock shot through her deliciously , and she laughed as they wheeled her to her room . CHAPTER 16 Down She changed in the shower . As he dried himself , he realized how good it was to be back at Freddie 's . The dingy bathroom was a pleasure after the antiseptic hospital suite . It felt like home . The coarse fabric of the towel across his back brought a twinge , a sense - memory of the spinal tap she 'd been subjected to a few days before . Americorp 's physicians had tested her mercilessly for two weeks : CAT scans , sonograms , fiber - optic insertions . She had carefully controlled what they withdrew from her , even during the spinal tap , and had destroyed the nanomachines they 'd slipped into her body . Of course , they did n't really need her . They He what was left they didn'they'd slippe Americorpd with cry have bee He shuddered . On a walk in the hospital corridors , limited to Americorp 's private wing , she had encountered a dolly stacked with cryostasis canisters , misting like dry ice . They could have been anythingplasma , transplant - ready organs , a superconducting coil . But for a moment she had imagined the line of Bonito 's jaw , his green eyes . The newsnets were full of Americorp 's big new push , a shift away from information services to biotechnology . He stepped from the bathroom , a little nervous about Freddie 's reaction to the change . 272 Scott Westerfeld Freddie sat at his new workstation , visor over his eyes , his frame sparkling with the nodes of a fullbody input suit . A million dollars bought a lot of toys . The cash had arrived by FedEx the day she got home from the hospital . The return address was in Belize ; black money from one of Americorp 's offshore operations , Freddie had guessed . There was no thank - you note . Lee suspected it was n't thanks at all . More like a down payment on services yet to be rendered . He was out of the hospital , but Americorp 's surveillance was always present . Like a watchful parent , it hovered at the edge of awareness , unintrusive , making itself known subtly yet surely . They knew that if he slipped through their fingers even once , he would disappear forever . Soon he would be able to lose them , if he really needed to . But that would mean leaving Freddie behind . Also , Ed King had Bonito 's papers and his data . They would have to be bargained for . Freddie was too deep into the net to look up . That was probably best . Lee dressed in jeans and a white T - shirt , looked through Freddie 's leather jackets . The jeans were too new looking . They were going to the Glory Hole that night . "
92269	92287	92288	92288	They	2487	" Freddie said from the workstation , his right hand making the faintest gesture toward the sky . “
92358	92388	92320	92321	Some guy	2773	" . A subtle message from Ed King . The retina scan was the one kind of ID he could n't beat . Not yet , anyway . POLYMORPH 273 "
92394	92411	92413	92415	The usual suspects	2490	" Lee asked . His voice was lower , but Freddie did n't seem to notice . “
92425	92426	92413	92415	The usual suspects	2490	" “
92440	92453	92413	92415	The usual suspects	2490	” Freddie did n't turn around , but his fingers stopped moving . "
92468	92469	92413	92415	The usual suspects	2490	" "
92472	92481	92413	92415	The usual suspects	2490	" Lee 's tone did n't invite argument . "
92494	92498	92484	92484	you	0	" Freddie asked . "
92502	92549	92484	92484	you	0	" He could send King messages too . Freddie flipped the visor up and turned around , about to say something . He paused at the sight of Lee 's new form , looked him up and down . Lee was suddenly embarrassed by his stare . “
92552	92557	92484	92484	you	0	" he asked Freddie . "
92567	92568	92560	92560	you	0	" "
92572	92573	92560	92560	you	0	” “
92582	92583	92560	92560	you	0	" “
92588	92589	92560	92560	you	0	” “
92599	92611	92594	92594	you	0	” Freddie smiled a little , as if laughing at himself . "
92626	92636	92594	92594	you	0	" Lee put his hands on Freddie 's shoulders . “
92645	92686	92687	92687	Man	1145	” He leaned forward and kissed him . There was just the slightest shudder in Freddie 's form , but he submitted to the kiss . When Lee drew back , Freddie 's smile had faded . Then Freddie laughed . “
92694	92759	92687	92687	Man	1145	" They laughed together . Freddie turned back to his workstation , and Lee massaged his shoulders for a while , letting him grow used to contact with the new 274 Scott Westerfeld body . Lee 's changes usually turned Freddie on . He figured this one would eventually . The monitor clock neared midnight . Lee kissed Freddie on the ear and said , “
92767	93401	93403	93403	yourself	2497	" Freddie made an inarticulate noise of assent . He climbed the stairs to the co - op 's roof . The air in the stairwell was hot and smelled of Spanish cooking . Someone had padlocked the roof door since the day before . A blow to the door snapped the hasp . Outside , the air was cool and still . The Empire State Building was lit red , white , and blue for the anniversary of the Intervention . In the clear night sky , he could see a widely spaced circle of planes in the La Guardia holding pattern . A few car alarms held forth in the distance . He paced the roof a little anxiously , preparing himself with a few shifts in his musculature , reinforcing his ribs to protect heart and lungs , hardening his cortex . Finally , he let his morphine organ expand a little , breathing deeply as the rush hit him . He went toward the back of the building , which overlooked an unlit airshaft . It was seven floors down , but at night the shaft looked infinitely deep . He knew that the bottom was paved with crumbling concrete , but free of broken glass and garbage . He took the T - shirt off . To the west , a VTOL freighter landed with a sovereign roar . He jumped . The moments of free fall were unexpectedly calm . There was no sense of hurtling downward as in a falling dream , only weightlessness . He had expected himself to tense as he fell , but instinct relaxed him utterly . For a second , the fall was timeless . In his ears , the sound of the impact was gigantic . After a brief incoherence , he awoke to a body awash in activated chemicals . Adrenaline , morphine , endorphins , and the rich rush of change buoyed him POLYMORPH 275 out of unconsciousness . His legs were badly broken , one femur splintered . A lung was collapsed , fragments of rib piercing it . He concentrated on its repair , trying to control the rattling cough that threatened to turn thick with blood . As he did so , poisons ran riot in his abdomen , where a ruptured kidney cried for attention . He turned from one crisis to the next frantically . His mind slipped closer to panic , until a mist of red gnats swarmed before his eyes . And then he felt it come . Control swept through his body like the rush of an aircraft 's acceleration , lifting him out of incoherence , thrusting a picture into his mind . He saw shattered bones swim , sinuous , to reform themselves . He saw organs flow like sand into their apposite shapes . Twisted muscles loosened , rent skin zippered closed . Almost casually , he coughed fluid from his lungs into his mouth , and swallowed . After he was healed , he lay for a while , a calm like the free fall having overcome him . Muscle and bone continued to shift as his thoughts wandered , a play of surfaces and forms under his taut skin . His morphine organ pulsed for a while and then slackened like an expended cock . His eyes opened and he smiled . He was ready to go out . He climbed the building easily . When he got back in , Freddie was dressed for the Glory Hole ; he 'd put on a black T - shirt and chinos . He looked at Lee 's jeans . They were scuffed and dirty , and despite his best efforts , blood had stained one knee . “
93405	93409	93403	93403	yourself	2497	" he asked . "
93415	93416	93403	93403	yourself	2497	" “
93426	93969	93403	93403	yourself	2497	” Freddie said with a smirk . Lee stuck his tongue out at him , eight inches studded with tiny pseudopods . Freddie 's face went briefly ashen , and he turned away . 276 Scott Westerfeld Lee smiled . Still buzzing from the fall , he was not in the mood for Freddie 's squeamishness . He put a hand on the boy 's shoulder . There was the slightest tug away . For a moment , the rejection hurt her , deep inside . Then , almost as a reflex , the morphine organ responded with a tiny burst . A flush of satisfaction filled him , and the dark look on Freddie 's face only prompted his desire . He took both shoulders , hard , and pushed Freddie against the wall . Through his fingers , he slipped filaments of nervous tissue into the bare shoulders , felt the flutter of Freddie 's heart , his confusion , the buzz of the speed he 'd taken before going on the net . Lee looked into Freddie 's eyes , trying to connect . He saw his desire reciprocated , with a hint of terror . He moved forward , his mouth at Freddie 's throat . When he allowed himself to be pushed back , his grip still firm , he saw he 'd marked Freddie 's neck . The terror in the boy 's eyes remained . Freddie was n't used to the new habits yet - the casual shape - shifting , the mood swings , the sudden violence . But he would learn . Coming From Roc Books in December 1998 The new book from Scott Westerfeld Fine Prey Chapter 1 : School The bed woke me with deliberate care . First a soft vibration that swept from foot to head repeatedly , then a gentle rocking , and finally a low chime that pulsed as the windows de - opaqued . The orange sun was still halved by the forested horizon ; the bed 's painstaking ministrations could not hide the fact that it was n't yet six . It took a full ten seconds of staring sleepily at the low orb , its shape burned into blue tracers on my retinas , to remember that it was the last day of school . With that , I leaped from bed . My roommate , Alex , was already gone , following to the last his perverse schedule of jogging for an hour before sunup . Of course , the run was his only freedom ; at Aya School , every moment of daylight was carefully prescribed . I had tried to join him at the beginning of semester , but it quickly became one discipline too many . I began heating the ceremonial morning meal , mindlessly uttering an appropriate Ayan votive . Out of the corner of my eye , the sun was slipping above the trees , and I rushed the prayer to conclusion . The meal stood ready when Alex , naked and sweaty , bolted in from his run . He grimaced at the sun , fully 280 Excerpt from FINE PREY clear from the trees , and muttered , “
93974	94108	94109	94109	I	0	" I whacked him halfheartedly with a rolled - up hunt magazine . He had been collecting too many infractions lately . We had drawn a room in the Salutatorian Seniors ' residence next year , and I did n't want to lose it . The building enjoyed an extra half hour of morning shade from the tall poplars at the edge of campus , which , according to the Ayan method of laying out the day , meant thirty minutes more sleep . Talking out loud in English was punishable by 144 demerits . As Juniors , we were supposed to speak , think , and shit in Ayan , twenty - four hours a day . He muttered a short , breathy trill which Hogson 's text series always translated as : “
94121	95017	94115	94115	you	2498	" At school , it pretty much meant something between ouch ! and fuck you , but he lofted it to the register of an affectionate mode . I did n't attempt to answer . My mouth was too dry in the mornings to really give the language its due . Alex was by far the better speaker . He had a natural feel for the airy vowels and glottal frictives of Ayan . His father had been on the original contact team , and I figured some of the collateral radiation had gotten into Alex 's genes , his language ability some perverse recompense for the bizarre cancers his dad had succumbed to . We were complimentary forces at school , his natural ability and slovenly working habits and my grim , scholarly discipline . That , and the fact that we had both lost our fathers , comprised the unspoken core of our friendship . Of course , we were also both riders of the fine hunt , but that we talked about all the time . We crunched through the morning meal in silence Excerpt from FINE PREY 281 and then dressed . The school uniform was a skintight , smart - fiber coverall , light gray for Juniors . The garment was lined with a colony of engineered bacteria that cleaned the skin , regulated our metabolisms , and protected us from any collaterals coming off our native Ayan teachers . Its hidden abilities were legendary in the rumor mill of the school . I 'd personally seen a student 's life saved by her suit . She had overdosed on a cortisone - based designer drug engineered to foil the suit 's substance monitors . The drug had slipped past the chemical censors well enough , but had also had the unfortunate side effect of stopping her heart . The suit registered the cardiac arrest and called the medics . Before they arrived , it stiffened and compressed bizarrely around her , forcing the blood from her extremities into the oxygen - starved brain . Her face turned a bright pink around bluing lips , her eyes agog and red with broken blood vessels . The med drones arrived a few minutes later and pumped her with jolt juice , and she was almost normal the next year . The real purposes of the suit were far more insidious , though . It protected us from being swayed by the human rhythms of bathing and menstruation , and from the adolescent scourges of zits and a sex drive . Aya School was total immersion , our young heads held under the water as if by some ass - kicking Baptist converting the heathen . Of course , this was the only way to learn a language born under an alien sun . I 'd been a star student in the curriculum since I was five years old , and my speaking proficiency compared to a native was roughly that of a polite but moronic adolescent . After eating we sat in the middle of the room , gnomon between us , and drilled a little . It was simple 282 Excerpt from FINE PREY stuff , prattling parallel niceties across the authoritative , and attendant modes . Alex badgered my demonstration mercilessly — my nominal hand movements were getting soft again — and I retaliated in the mercantile . He was better at the old modes , the ones that measured status and obligation by the drop . Today , though , he was just as facile with the egalitarian mercantile . That was good to see . I was half afraid that he would snap today and screw up an exemplary ( for him ) semester . Three years as his roommate had endowed me with a healthy dread of last - minute fuck - ups . I was probably being paranoid . After all , the testing today was relatively trivial . The school did n't follow the human academic rhythms of crunch and finals time , because that would have been very un - Ayan indeed . But even for a human , Alex had been jumpy lately . By now , the ceiling was transparent , and the shadow of the gnomon had reached the jewel at First Call . The little fleck of stone was imbedded in a resonant cavity in the hard floor . It sang softly , converting stored solar energy into sound . The jewels were beloved by the Aya because their singing sounded a little like Ayan : a whispery , airy shushing . They were the mythological source of the Ayan language , although with the Aya the line between myth and history was pretty fuzzy . The lack of a literal mode was one of the profoundly dirty tricks the language played on its human students . As we waited a few moments before taking the Call ( punctuality was not tolerated at school ) , Alex wished me good luck with rattling frictives of excessive gravity . I joked back at him in an imperious mode , cocking my head in the human equivalent of Excerpt from FINE PREY 283 a coutier 's tail twitch , but he took my wrist and spoke in English , dead serious .

95028	95049	95020	95020	you	2499	" I said , then swore , realizing I 'd answered in English . I looked nervously at the intercom . "
95055	95067	95020	95020	you	2499	" he said , demonstrating a milimeter between forefinger and thumb , "
95073	95253	95020	95020	you	2499	" Despite myself , I smiled at him . I 'd almost not let myself think about it . With the end of school came the riding season . Actually , it had started a week before , but Alex and I always missed the Milan shows ; Aya School ran a full month longer than the rest of the world 's elite academies . It was part of Alex 's job as the bad boy in our relationship to throw this in my face . I , the good student , had suppressed how soon we would be in competition again . The constrained world of elegant cycles , hushed hallways , and byzantine grammar was about to shatter , the shushing of Ayan replaced by the squeal of prey on the killing ground . I felt the heat of it prickle my skin inside the modulated cool of the coverall . It was a very un - Ayan explosion of joy . I put my hand into Alex 's , breaking the loop of his tensed fingers . "
