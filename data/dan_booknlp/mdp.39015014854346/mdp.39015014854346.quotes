140	146	147	148	Charlie Johns	67	" URGENTLY cried Charlie Johns : "
153	183	184	184	I	0	” for that was the absolute necessity — to know who Charlie Johns was , not to let go of that for a second , for anything , ever . “
189	1017	186	187	Charlie Johns	67	” he said argumentatively , and plaintively , he said it again . No one argued , no one denied it . He lay in the warm dark with his knees drawn up and his arms crossed and his forehead pressed tight against his kneecaps . He saw dull flickering red , but that was inside his eyelids , and he was Charlie Johns . C. Johns once stencilled on a foot - locker , written in speedball black - letter on a high - school diploma , typed on a paycheck . Johns , Chas . in the telephone book . The name , all right . All right , fine , okay , but a man is more than a name . A man is twenty - seven years old , he sees the hairline just so in his morning mirror and likes a drop of Tabasco on his eggs ( over light : whites firm , yolks runny ) . He was born with one malformed toe and a strabismus . He can cook a steak drive a car love a girl run a mimeograph go to the bathroom brush his teeth , including the permanent bridge , left upper lateral incisor and bicuspid . He left the house in plenty of time but he is going to be late to work . He opened his eyes and it was n't dull flickering red at all , but grey — a cold sourceless silver , grey like snail trails on the lilac leaves — a springtime thing , that . Spring it was , oh that springtime thing ; it was love last night , Laura , she When daylight saving time is new , the daylit evening is forever , and you can do so much . How he begged Laura for the chance to get her screens up ; if Mom could have seen that , now ! And down in Laura 's stinking cellar , shuffling through the half - dark with the screens under his arm , he had walked into the cruel point of the dangling strap - hinge of a discarded shutter , torn a hole in his brown tweed pants , punched a red blood - bruise ( with warp and woof stamped VENUS PLUS X on it ) on his thigh . And worth it , worth it , all that foreverevening , with a girl , a real girl ( she could prove it ) for all the long end of the evening ; and all the way home love ! of here and of now , and spring of course , and oh of course lovel said the tree - frogs , the lilacs , the air , and the way sweat dried on him . ( Good - this is good . Good to be a part of here and of now , and spring of course , and oh of course , love ; but best of all , to remember , to know it all , Charlie . ) Better than love just to remember home , the walk between high hedges , the two white lamps with the big black 61 painted on each ( Mom had done that for the landlord ; she was clever with her hands ) only they were pretty weathered by now , yes the hands too . The foyer with the mottled brass wall - full of mailboxes and discreet pushbuttons for the tenants , and the grille of the house phone that had never worked since they moved here , and that massive brass plate solidly concealing the electric lock , which for years he had opened with a blow of his shoulder , never breaking stride . . . and get closer , closer , because it is so important to remember ; nothing remembered is important ; it 's remembering that matters ; you can ! you can ! The steps from the ground floor had old - fashioned nickelplated nosings over carpet worn down to the backing , red fuzz at the edges . ( Miss Mundorf taught first grade , Miss Willard taught second grade , Miss Hooper taught fifth . Remember everything . ) He looked around him , where he lay remembering in the silver light ; the soft walls were unlike metal and unlike fabric but rather like both , and it was very warm ... he went on remembering with his eyes open : the flight from the second floor to the third had the nickel nosing too , but no carpeting , and the steps were all hollowed , oh , very slightly ; mounting them , you could be thinking about anything , but that clack clack , as a change from the first flight 's flap flap , put you right there , you knew where you were ... Charlie Johns screamed , “
1024	1202	147	148	Charlie Johns	67	” He unfolded himself , rolled over on his stomach , drew up his knees , and then for a moment could move no more . His mouth was dry and hot inside as pillowslips creasing under Mom 's iron ; his muscles , leg and back , all soft and tighttangled like the knitting basket Mom was going to clean out some day ... ... love with Laura , spring , the lights with 61 , the shoulder on the lock , up the stairs flap flap , clack clack and surely he could remember the rest of the way , because he had VENUS PLUS X gone in gone to bed gotten up left for work . . . had n't he ? Had n't he ? Shakily he pressed himself up , knelt , weakly squatted . His head dropped forward and he rested , panting . He watched the brown fabric of his clothes as if it were a curtain , about to open upon unknown but certain horror . And it did . “
1207	1737	147	148	Charlie Johns	67	” he whispered . Because there on his thigh was the little rip ( and under it the small hurtful bulge of the checkered bruise ) to prove that he had not dressed for work this morning , had not even reached the top of the second flight . Instead , he was here . Because he could not stand just yet , he hunched around , fists and knees , blinking and turning his unsteady head . Once he stopped and touched his chin . It had no more stubble than it should have for a man coming home from a date he had shaved for . He turned again and saw a tall oval finely scribed into the curved wall . It was the first feature he had been able to discover in this padded place . He gaped at it and it gave him Nothing . He wondered what time it was . He lifted his arm and turned his head and got his ear to his watch . It was , thank God , still running . He looked at it . He looked at it for a long time without moving . He seemed not to be able to read it . At last he was able to understand that the numerals were the wrong way round , mirror - reversed ; 2 was where 10 should be , 8 where four should be . The hands pointed to what should have been eleven minutes to eleven , but was , if this watch really were running backwards , eleven minutes past one . And it was running backwards . The sweep second - hand said so . And do you know , Charlie , something under the terror and the wonderment said to him , do you know , all you want to do , even now , is remember ? there was the terrible old battleax you got for Algebra 3 in high school , when you 'd flunked Algebra 1 and had to take it over , and had gone through Algebra 2 and Geometry 1 on your belly , and flunked Geometry 2 and had to take it over - remember ? and then for Algebra 3 you got this Miss Moran , and she was like IBM , with teeth . And then one day you asked her about something that puzzled you a little and the way she answered , you had to ask more ... and she opened a door for you that you never knew was there , and she herself became something ... well , after that , you watched her and knew what the frozen mein , the sharp discipline , the sheer inhumanity of the woman VENUS PLUS X was for . She was just waiting for someone to come and ask her questions about mathematics a little beyond , a little outside the book . And it was as if she had long ago despaired of finding anyone that would . Why it meant so much to her was that she loved mathematics in a way that made it a pity the word "
1739	2181	2282	2282	your	228	" had ever been used for anything else . And also that from minute to minute she never knew if some kid asking questions would be the last she 'd ever know , or open a door for , because she was dying of cancer , which nobody never even suspected until she just did n't show up one day . Charlie Johns looked at the faint oval in the soft silver wall and wished Miss Moran could be here . He also wished Laura could be here . He could remember them both so clearly , yet they were so many years apart from each other ( and how many , he thought , looking at his wrist watch , how many years from me ? ) He wished Mom could be here , and the Texas redhead . ( She was the first time for him , the redhead ; and how would she mix with Mom ? For that matter , how would Laura mix with Miss Moran ? ) He could not stop remembering ; dared not , and did not want to stop . Because as long as he kept remembering , he knew he was Charlie Johns ; and although he might be in a new place without knowing what time it was , he was n't lost , no one is ever lost , as long as he knows who he is . Whimpering with effort , he got to his feet . He was so weak and muzzy - headed that he could only stand by bracing his feet wide apart ; he could only walk by flailing his arms to keep his balance . He aimed for the faint oval line on the wall because it was the only thing here to aim for , but when he tried to go forward he progressed diagonally sidewise ; it was like the time ( he remembered ) at the fun house at Coney Island , where they get you in a room and close it up and unbeknownst to you they tilt it a little to one side , you with no outside reference ; and only green mirrors to see yourself in . They used to have to hose it out five , six times a day . He felt the same way now ; but he had an advantage ; he knew who he was , and in addition he knew he was sick . As he stumbled on the soft curved part where the floor became wall , and sank on one knee on the resilient silver , he croaked , “
2193	2207	2182	2182	I	0	” Then he heard his own words properly and leapt to his feet : “
2212	2216	2217	2217	I	0	” he shouted , “
2220	2277	2217	2217	I	0	" He tottered forward , and since there was nothing to hold on the oval - it was only a thin line , taller than he was he pushed against it . VENUS PLUS X It opened . There was someone waiting outside , smiling , dressed in such a way that Charlie gasped and said , “
2285	2388	2282	2282	your	228	" and then pitched forward on his face . erb Raile lives out in Homewood , where he has a hundred and fifty feet on Begonia Drive , and two hundred and thirty feet back to where Smitty Smith 's begins its two - hundred - and - thirty - foot run to its onehundred - fifty - foot frontage on Calla Drive . Herb Raile 's house is a split - level , Smith 's a rancher . Herb 's neighbors to the right and left have splits . Herb wheels into the drive and honks and puts his head out . “
2391	2441	2442	2442	Daddy	79	” Jeanette is mowing the lawn with a power mower and with all that racket , the car horn makes her jump immoderately . She puts her foot on the grounding - plate and holds it down until the mower stops , and then runs laughing to the car . “
2446	2447	2448	2448	Daddy	79	” “
2454	2462	2450	2450	daddy	229	” Davy is five , Karen three . “
2472	2473	2465	2465	honey	231	” “

2525	2536	2519	2519	I	0	” Davy shrills , poking in Herb 's side pocket . "
2544	2555	2537	2537	I	0	” shrieks Karen . Herb laughs and scoops her up . “
2568	2569	2519	2519	I	0	” “
2588	2604	2583	2583	you	76	” Herb puts down the three - year - old and turns to the car . “

2657	2658	2635	2635	I	0	” “
2667	2722	2665	2665	Louie	82	” He takes the parcel and goes in to change . While he is gone , Davy puts his foot where Jeanette put her foot when she stopped the mower . The 10 VENUS PLUS X cylinder head is still hot . Davy is barefoot . When Herb comes out again Jeanette is saying , “
2731	3200	2728	2729	a man	1334	" Herb is wearing shorts and a T - shirt . IT WASN'T MAIDENLY modesty that made Charlie Johns keel over like that . Anything could have done it — a flashlight in the face , the sudden apparition of steps going down . And anyway , he 'd thought it was a woman dressed like that . He had n't been able to think of anyone else but women since he found himself in that tank - Laura , Mom , Miss Moran , the Texas redhead . He could see why a flash glance at this character would make anyone think so . Not that he could really see anything at the moment ; he was lying flat on his back on something resilient but not so soft as the tank — rather like those wheel tables they have in hospitals . And someone was gently working on a cut high on his forehead , while a cool wet cloth smelling remotely like witch hazel lay blissfully across the rest of his forehead and his eyes . But whoever it was was talking to him , and though he could n't understand a word , he did n't think it was a woman 's voice . It was no basso profundo , but it was n't a woman 's voice . Oh brother , what a get - up . Imagine a sort of short bathrobe , deep scarlet , belted , but opening sharply away above and below . Above it was cut back behind the arms , and back of the neck a stiff collar stood up higher than the top of the head ; it was shaped like the back of an upholstered chair and was darn near as big . Below the belt the garment cut back and down just as sharply to come together in a swallow - tail like a formal coat . In front , under the belt , was a short silky arrangement something like what the Scot wears in front of his kilt and calls a sporran . Very soft - looking slipper - socks , the same color as the robe , and with sharp - cut , floppy points front and back , came up to about mid - calf . Whatever the treatment was , it killed the throb in his forehead with almost shocking suddenness . He lay still a moment , afraid that it might rear up and bash him as suddenly , but it did n't . He put up a tentative hand , whereupon the cloth was snatched away from his eyes and he found himself VENUS PLUS X 11 looking up into a smiling face which said several fluid syllables , ending in an interrogative trill . Charlie said , “
3205	3237	3238	3238	I	0	” The face shrugged its eyebrows and laughed pleasantly . Firm cool fingers touched his lips , and the head wagged from side to side . Charlie understood , so said , "
3245	3839	3238	3238	I	0	” He reared up on one elbow and looked around him . He felt much stronger . He was in a large , stubbily T - shaped chamber . Most of the stem of the T was taken up by the call it padded cell he had left ; its door stood open still . Inside and out , it gleamed with that sourceless , soft , cold silver light . It looked like a huge pumpkin with wings . The whole top of the T , floor to ceiling and from end to end , was a single transparent pane . Charlie thought he may have seen one as large in a department - store show - window , but he doubted it . At each end of the T were drapes ; he presumed there were doors there . Outside it was breathtaking . A golf - course can sometimes present rolling green something like that — but not miles , square miles of it . There were stands of trees here and there , and they were tropical ; the unmistakable radiance of the flamboyante could be seen , nearly felt , it was so vivid ; and there were palms - traveler 's , cabbage , and coconut palms , and palmettos ; tree - ferns and flowering cacti . On a clump of stone ruins , so very picturesque they might almost have been built there for the purpose of being picturesque ruins , stood a magnificent strangler fig nearly a hundred feet high , with its long clutching roots and multiple trunks matching the arch and droop of its glossy foliage . The only building to be seen and they were up quite high - twelve or fourteen stories , Charlie guessed , and on high ground at that - was impossible . Take a cone - a dunce cap . Taper it about three times as tall as it ought to be . Now bend it into a graceful curve , almost to a quarter circle . Now invert it , place its delicate tip in the ground and walk away , leaving its heavy base curying up and over and supported by nothing at all . Now make the whole thing about four hundred feet high , with jewellike groups of pleasantly asymmetrical windows , and oddly placed , curved balconies which seemed to be of , rather than on the surface , and you have an idea of that building , that impossible building . Charlie Johns looked at it , and at his companion , and , 12 VENUS PLUS X open - mouthed , at the building and back again . The man looked , and did not look human . The eyes were almost too far apart and too long - a little more of both , and they 'd have been on the sides rather than the front of his face . The chin was strong and smooth , the teeth prominent and excellent , the nose large and with nostrils so high - arched that only a fraction of arc spared them from belonging to some horse . Charlie already knew that those fingers were strong and gentle ; so was the face , the whole mein and carriage . The torso was rather longer , somehow , than it ought to be , the legs a little shorter than , if Charlie were an artist , he would have drawn them . And of course , those clothes ... “
3845	4650	3238	3238	I	0	" quavered Charlie Johns , meaning to be funny somehow , and sounding pitiably frightened . He made a useless gesture at the building . To his surprise , the man nodded eagerly and smiled . He had a warm and confident smile . He pointed to Charlie , to himself , and to the building , took a step toward the enormous window and beckoned . Well , why not ? ... yet Charlie cast a lingering glance back at the door of the silver cell from which he had emerged . Little as he liked it , it was the only thing here which was remotely familiar to him . The man sensed his feeling , and made a reassuring , sort of U - turn gesture toward the distant building and back to the cell . With a half - hearted smile , Charlie agreed to go . The man took him briskly by the arm and marched off , not to the draped ends of the room , but straight to the window , straight through the window . This last he did by himself . Charlie dug in his heels and fled back to the wheeled table . The man stood outside , firmly on thin air , and beckoned , smiling . He called to Charlie too , but Charlie only saw that ; there was no sound . When one is in an enclosed place , one feels it — actually , one hears it - in any case , one knows it , and Charlie knew it . Yet that bright - robed creature had stepped through whatever enclosed it , leaving it enclosed , and was now impatiently , though cheerfully , calling to Charlie to join him . There is a time for pride , thought Charlie , and this is it , and I have n't got any . He crept to the window , got down on his hands and knees , and slowly reached toward the pane . It was there , to ear , to spatial feel , but not to his hand . He inched outward . VENUS PLUS X 13 The man , laughing ( but laughing with , not laughing at , Charlie was certain ) walked outdoors on nothing and came to him . When he made as if to take Charlie 's hand , Charlie snatched it back . The man laughed again , bent and slapped hard against the level which unaccountably carried his feet . Then he stood up and stamped . Well , obviously he was standing on something . Charlie , remembering ( again ) remembered seeing an old West Indian woman at San Juan airport , coming for no one knows what reason off her first flight , meeting her first escalator . She backed and filled and touched and jumped , until finally the husky young man with her picked her up bodily and plunked her on it . She grasped the rail and shrieked all the way up , and at the top , continued her shrieks ; they were , they had been all along , shrieks of laughter . Well , crawl he might , but he would n't shriek . Pale and hollow - eyed , he put a hand through where the pane was n't , and slapped where the man had slapped . This one he could feel . Crawling on one hand and two knees , paddling ahead of him with the other hand , eyes slitted and head back so he would see out but not down , he passed through the nothingat - all which so adequately enclosed the room , out upon the nothing - at - all which waited outside . The man , whose voice he could suddenly hear again , laughingly beckoned him farther out , but Charlie was as far out as he intended to be . So to his horror the man suddenly swooped on him , lifted him bodily , and bumped his right hand down on a midair nothing about waist high to him a handraill Charlie gazed at his right hand , apparently empty but grasping a blessed something ; he could see the flattened flesh at the side of his grip , the whitening knuckles . He placed his other hand beside it and looked across the breeze - there was quite a breeze - at the other , who said something in his singing tongue and pointed downward . Reflexively Charlie Johns looked down , and gasped . It was probably no more than two hundred feet , but they looked to him like miles . He gulped and nodded , for obviously the man had said something cheerful like "
4656	4671	4673	4673	we	243	” Too late , he realized that the man had said the equivalent of , "
4678	4879	4675	4676	old boy	244	” and he had gone and nodded his head . They dropped . Charlie sbrieked . It was not laugther . * I he Bon Ton Alleys are -is - a complex , consisting of , naturally , bowling alleys , and of course an adjoining bar ; but a good deal has been added . To the tissue - dispensers , for example , a second teensyweensy dispenser for teensy tissues for milady 's lipstick . To the bar , as well , foamy cottage curtains and a floor - length skirt around the pretzel - and - egg stand . The barmaid has become somehow a waitress . No one has traced the evolution from beer out of cans to pink ladies and even excuse - theexpression vermouth and soda . The pool tables are gone and are replaced by a gifte shoppe . Here sit Jeanette Raile and her neighbor , Tillie Smith , over a well - earned ( Tillie , especially , is getting to be a first - line , league - type bowler ) crème de menthe frappé , and get down to the real business of the evening , which is business . “

Like here at last you can buy a car with a gadget on it that locks both rear wheels in such a way that they turn together , so you can pull out VENUS PLUS X 29 of a spot where one wheel is on ice . So maybe she 's read about it in an ad or something , she asks you about it . You say , well , it just cuts out the differential effect . As soon as you say the word you can see her black out . So you tell her the differential is nothing complicated , it 's these gears at the back of the drive shaft that make it possible for the rear wheel at the outside of a turn to rotate faster than the wheel at the inside . But all the while you 're talking you can see she is blacked out , and she will stay blacked out until you get off the subject . Frequency , too . ”

12094	12202	11618	11618	he	76	“ Well it bothers me , that 's all . Word like ' frequency ' now ; it 's good English . It says what it means . ' Frequent ' means often , ' frequency ' means how often something happens . ' Cycles'—that 's another blackout word - means what it says too : from the top around to the top again . Or maybe from forth to back to forth again , which amounts to the same thing .

25993	26065	26070	26070	yourself	678	” Mielwis did not answer , but remained still , looking at him kindly from those wide eyes and keeping a poised , also kindly , half - smile on his lips . In spite of his embarrassment , which for some reason began to be acute , Charlie recognized the technique and admired it ; he 'd had a teacher once who did that . It was a way of saying "
26072	26096	26070	26070	yourself	678	" but it would never be used on anyone who had not all the VENUS PLUS X 57 facts . Sort of like the “
26101	26242	26243	26243	I	0	" in an Ellery Queen whodunit . Charlie jumbled together in his mind all the uneasy impressions he had had on the matter : the large ( but not unusually large ) pectoral development , and the size of the areolae ; the absence of wide - shouldered , narrow - hipped individuals . As to other cosmetic characteristics , like the hair , worn in as many different ways as clothes , though predominantly short , and the clothes themselves with their wild variegation , he refused to be led astray . Then he turned to the language , which so unaccountably ( to him ) he could speak with fluency , and yet which was constantly presenting him with mysteries and enigmas . He looked at the grave and patient Mielwis , and said to himself in Ledom : "
26249	26255	26256	26256	him	680	” And he examined the pronoun "
26257	26286	26287	26287	him	680	” by itself for the very first time , and found that it had gender only in his own reference ; when he spoke the word it translated to "
26288	26345	26256	26256	him	680	” in English because , for some reason of his own , Charlie preferred it that way . But in its own reference , in the Ledom tongue , it had no sexual nor gender meaning . Yet it was a personal pronoun ; it would not be used in speaking of things . In English , "
26347	26355	26287	26287	him	680	" is an impersonal pronoun ; the word "
26357	26371	26256	26256	him	680	" used as a pronoun is not , stilted though it may be : “
26380	26409	26410	26410	he	680	” The personal pronoun — and there was only one ! in Ledom was like that : personal and without gender . That Charlie had told himself it was “
26411	26470	26287	26287	him	680	” was Charlie 's own mistake , and now he knew it . Did the pronoun 's having no gender mean the Ledom then had no sex ? For that would be one way to make Philos ' extraordinary remark consistent : they had never seen a male , but they were not females . The words and concepts “
26472	26474	26410	26410	he	680	” and “
26476	26508	26287	26287	him	680	” existed in the language ... the alternative was : both . The Ledom , each of them , had both sexes . He looked up into Mielwis ' patient eyes . “
26513	26560	26509	26509	You	682	" he said . Mielwis did not move or speak for what seemed a very long time . Then his half - smile broadened , as if he were pleased at what he saw in Charlie 's upturned face . Gently , then , he said , “
26568	26569	26570	26570	I	0	” "
26581	26586	26570	26570	I	0	” said Charlie candidly . "

26605	26631	26633	26634	Tillie Smith	83	” said Mielwis , and in his stately way he rose and came around his desk toward the stricken Charlie . * li , bulls ! ”
26636	26641	26633	26634	Tillie Smith	83	“ What 's bulling ? ”
26642	26647	26649	26649	Smith	83	" Just man talk , "
26654	26663	26651	26651	Herb	76	“ Hi , bowls . What 's bowling ? ”
26667	26675	26664	26664	Jeanette	113	“ Three strikes and I 'm out . "
26676	26683	26684	26684	Smith	83	" Herb already used the gag , ”
26701	26716	26696	26696	Tillie	83	“ What 's everybody saying highballs for ? Let 's all have a drink . ”
26717	26721	26723	26723	Herb	76	“ Not us , ”
26734	26744	26723	26723	Herb	76	“ I 've had mine and it 's late . ”
26745	26749	26751	26751	Jeanette	113	“ Me too , ”
26758	26769	26770	26770	Herb	76	“ Thanks for the drinks and all the dirty jokes , ”
26775	26786	26788	26788	Smith	83	“ Let 's not tell 'em about the dancing girls , ”
26796	26806	26807	26807	Tillie	83	“ ' Night , Til . Keep 'em rolling . "
26897	27059	26875	26875	she	113	” MIELwis said , and Charlie rose and followed him into a smaller room . One whole end , floor to ceiling , was a pattern of slits with labels — some sort of filing system , he presumed ; and Lord preserve us , even these were not in straight lines , but in arcs . .. and come to think of it , they did resemble the arcs he had seen drawn on an assembly bench , once , by an 58 VENUS PLUS X 59 efficiency expert : maximum reach of right hand , optimum reach of left hand , and so on . Attached to one wall was a flat white soft shelf - an examination table if ever he saw one . Mielwis , in passing , batted it gently and it followed him down the room , slowly sinking , until when it was within ten feet of the wall it was at chair height . "
27063	27095	26875	26875	she	113	" Mielwis said over his shoulder . Numbly , Charlie sat , and watched the big Ledom stand and glance over the labels . Suddenly , surely , he reached up . “
27100	27314	27315	27315	We	686	" He hooked his slender fingertips in one of the slots and moved his hand downward . A chart began feeding out of the slot ; it was about three feet wide and was very nearly seven feet long . As it came down the lights in the room slowly dimmed , while the picture on the chart brightened . Mielwis reached up and started a second chart and then sat beside Charlie . The room was now totally dark , and the charts blazed with light . In full color , they were the front and side views of a Ledom , clad only in the silky sporran which began perhaps an inch under the navel and fell , widening from perhaps a palm 's breadth at the top , to its lower edge , which was roughly three inches above mid - thigh , and which extended from the front of one leg to the front of the other . Charlie had seen them , already , longer and shorter than this , and also red , green , blue , purple and snowy white , but he had yet to see the Ledom who went without one . It was obviously a tight taboo , and he did not comment . “
27319	27890	27315	27315	We	686	" said Mielwis , and by means unperceived by Charlie Johns , he caused the chart to change : blip ! And the sporran , as well as the superficial skin under it , were gone , exposing the fascia and some of the muscle fibres of the abdominal wall . With a long black pointer he magically produced , he indicated the organs and functions he described . The tip of the pointer was a needle , a circle , an arrow and a sort of half - parenthesis at his will , and his language was concise and intimately geared to Charlie 's questions . And Charlie asked questions ! His unease had long since disappeared , and two of his most deep - dyed characteristics took over : one , the result of his omnivorous , undisciplined , indefatigable reading and picking of brains ; second , the great gaping holes this had left in his considerable body of knowledge . Both appeared far more drastic than he had heretofore known ; he knew ever so much more than he knew he knew , and he had between five and seven times as much misinformation and ignorance than he had ever dreamed . 60 VENUS PLUS X The anatomical details were fascinating , as such things so often are , and for the usual reason which overwhelms anyone with the vestiges of a sense of wonder : the ingenuity , the invention , the efficient complexity of a living thing . First of all , the Ledom clearly possessed both sexes , in an active form . First of all , the intromittent organ was rooted far back in what might be called , in homo sap . , the vaginal fossa . The base of the organ had , on each side of it , an os uteri , opening to the two cervixes , for the Ledom had two uteri and always gave birth to fraternal twins . On erection the phallos descended and emerged ; when flaccid it was completely enclosed , and it , in turn , contained the urethra . Coupling was mutual — indeed , it would be virtually impossible any other way . The testicles were neither internal nor external , but superficial , lying in the groin just under the skin . And throughout , there was the most marvellous reorganization of the nervous plexi , at least two new sets of sphincter muscles , and an elaborate redistribution of such functions as those of Bartholin 's and Cowper 's glands . When he was quite , quite satisfied that he had the answers , and when he could think of no more , and when Mielwis had exhausted his own promptings , Mielwis flicked the two charts with the back of his hand and they slid up and disappeared into their slots , while the lights came up . Charlie sat quietly for a moment . He had a vision of Laura - of all women ... of all men . Biology , he remembered irrelevantly ; they used to use the astronomical symbols for Mars and Venus for male and female . ... What in hell would they use for these ? Mars plus y ? Venus plus x ? Saturn turned upside down ? Then he heeled his eyes and looked up at Mielwis , blinking . “
27907	27935	28124	28124	you	688	" Mielwis laughed indulgently , and turned back to the rack . He ( and even after such a demonstration , Charlie found himself thinking of Mielwis as “
27936	27998	28001	28001	Mielwis	688	he"—which was still the convenient translation of the genderless Ledom pronoun ) he began hunting up and back and down . Charlie waited patiently for new revelation , but Mielwis gave an annoyed grunt and walked to the corner , where he placed his hand on one of the ubiquitous , irregular swirls of design . A tiny voice said politely , “
28003	28007	28001	28001	Mielwis	688	” Mielwis said , “
28022	28028	28012	28012	you	688	” Came the tiny voice , "
28037	28105	28012	28012	you	688	" VENUS PLUS X 61 Mielwis thanked the voice and went round to a second bank of slots at the side . He found what he was looking for . Charlie rose when he beckoned , and came to him , and the bench followed obediently . Mielwis tapped down more charts , and seated himself . The lights dimmed and went out ; the charts flamed . “
28118	28122	28124	28124	you	688	" Mielwis began . “
28145	28196	28131	28131	I	0	" He began with a beautiful demonstration of the embryology of the human reproductive organs , showing how similar were the prenatal evidences of the sexual organs , to the end of showing how really similar they remained . Every organ in the male has its counterpart in the female . "
28232	28534	28219	28219	you	688	” ( It was the first time he had heard any of the Ledom make a knowledgeable reference to homo sap . ) He went on with some charts of a pathological nature . He demonstrated how , with biochemicals alone , one organ could be made to atrophy and another actually perform a function when it itself had been vestigial to begin with . A man could be made to lactate , a woman to grow a beard . He demonstrated that progesterone was normally secreted by males , and testosterone by females , if only in limited amounts . He went on to show pictures of other species , to give Charlie an idea of how wide a variety there is , in nature , in the reproductive act : the queen bee , copulating high in midair , and thereafter bearing within her a substance capable of fertilizing literally hundreds of thousands of eggs for literally generation after generation ; dragon - flies , in their winged love - dance with each slender body bent in a U , forming an almost perfect circle whirling and skimming over the marshes ; and certain frogs the female of which lays her eggs in large pores in the male 's back ; seahorses whose males give birth to the living young ; octopods who , when in the presence of the beloved , wave a tentacle the end of which breaks off and swims by itself over to the female who , if willing , enfolds it and if not , eats it . By the time he was finished , Charlie was quite willing to concede that , in terms of all nature , the variation between Ledom and homo sap . was neither intrinsically unusual nor especially drastic . “
28539	28554	28219	28219	you	688	” he asked , when he had had a chance to mull all this . "
28561	28573	28219	28219	you	688	" : 62 VENUS PLUS X Mielwis answered with a question : "

Well , in the handle is a sub - miniature force - field generator . The shape of the field is determined by guides made of a special alloy . The field is so small you could n't see it , even if it was visible , which it is n't , with nine electron microscopes in series . But that blue wire around the edge is so composed that every atom in it is an exact analog of the subatomic particles forming the guides . And for reasons of spatial stress that I wo n't waste your time with , an analog of the field appears inside the loop . Right ? Right . That 's the gadget , the building block . Everything else around here is done by piling it up . The window - that 's an analog loop . There 's two of 'em holding up this building — you did n't think it was done with prayer , did you ? ”

34691	34765	34766	34766	He	799	" It sure would . You have an eye , but you do n't need an eye to see that . Sure , this heap is propped up two ways from the outside . And the loops are there . But instead of being made of alloy , they 're standing waves . If you do n't know what a standing wave is I wo n't bother you with it . See that ? ”
34783	34786	34788	34788	Seace	62	“ That , ”
34790	34841	34788	34788	Seace	62	“ is one of the props , or the outer end of it . Try to imagine a model of this building , held up VENUS PLUS X 75 by two triangles of transparent plastic , and you 'll have an idea of the shape and size of the fields . ”
34842	34851	34435	34435	Charlie	67	“ What happens when somebody walks into it ? ”
34852	34930	34788	34788	Seace	62	“ Nobody does . Cut an arch in the ground - line of your piece of plastic , and you 'll see why not . Sometimes a bird hits one , poor thing , but mostly they seem to be able to avoid it . It remains invisible because the surface is n't really a surface , but a vibrating matrix of forces , and dust wo n't sit on it . And it 's perfectly transparent . ”
34931	34964	34788	34788	Seace	62	“ But ... does n't it yield ? The bowl of that spoon I used , it sagged under the weight of the food — I saw it . And these windows ... "
34965	34972	34973	34973	Seace	62	“ You have got an eye ! "
34976	35052	34973	34973	Seace	62	" Well , wood is matter , brick is matter , steel is matter . What 's the difference between them ? Why , what 's in 'em , and how it 's put together , that 's all . The A - field can be dialled to be anything you want it to be thick , thin , impermeable , what have you . Also rigid - rigid like nothing else has ever been . ”

35179	35193	35171	35171	Seace	62	“ You 're looking at the underside of an A - field bubble . ”
35194	35198	35150	35150	Seace	62	“ You mean — "
35199	35224	35171	35171	Seace	62	“ Sure , all of Ledom is under a roof . Temperature controlled , humidity controlled , breezes blowing when they 're told to . "
35225	35230	35171	35171	Seace	62	“ And no night ... "
35231	35241	35150	35150	Seace	62	“ We do n't sleep , so why bother ? ”
35302	35309	35295	35295	He	67	" What 's outside , Seace ? "
35310	35317	35318	35318	Charlie	67	“ Better leave that to Philos . "
35363	35401	35346	35346	he	67	" Just tell me one thing , as — a — a matter of theory , Seace . If the A - field is transparent to light , it would be transparent to any radiation , no ? "

35609	35800	35841	35841	you	813	” He thumped the concrete - like curved pillar at the side of the window . Charlie , who at one time had run a bulldozer , began to compliment himself on his early determination to be only impressed , but not amazed , by technology . He recalled one time on a drydock job , when he was driving an AllisChalmers HD-14 angledozer back to the tractor shop to have a new corner welded on the blade , and a labor foreman flagged him and asked him to backfill a trench . While the pick - and - shovel boys scrambled out of the way , he backfilled and tamped a hundred feet of trench on one pass , in about 90 seconds — a job which would have taken the 60 - odd men the rest of the week . Given the gadgetry , one skilled man is a hundred , a thousand , ten thousand . It was difficult , but not impossible , to visualize the likes of the Medical One , four hundred feet high , being put up in a week by three men . "
35849	35863	35841	35841	you	813	” All the new people too , said Charlie , but not aloud . “

36270	36283	36252	36254	The otherthe other	820	” He translated the term into English and was going to say , “

36302	36327	36379	36380	a brain	821	" was indeed a word and concept in Ledom , but it was not the same word as the suffix ( in Ledom ) of "

36687	36778	36787	36787	Charlie	67	" And what the cerebrostyle does is to absorb certain sequences from , say , my mind and then transfers them to , say yours ; but it is not the mere presentation of a total , a conclusion ; it is the instillation of the entire sequence which led up to it . It 's done almost instantaneously , and all that 's required of the receiving mind is to correlate it with what 's already there . That last , incidentally , is a full - time job . "
36779	36786	36787	36787	Charlie	67	" I 'm not sure that 14 "
36794	36933	36790	36790	Seace	62	“ What I mean is that if , among a good many proven data , the mind contained some logically - arrivedat statement -- and mind you , logic and truth are two totally different things to the effect that alcohol and water are immiscible — that statement would ultimately find itself in conflict with other statements . Which one would win out would depend on how much true and demonstrable data were there to match it against . At length ( actually , damn soon ) the mind would determine that one of the statements was wrong . That situation will itch until the mind finds out why it 's wrong — that is , until it has exhaustively compared each logical step , from premise to conclusion , of every relative step of every other conclusion . ”
36934	36941	36787	36787	Charlie	67	“ A pretty fair teaching device . ”
36942	36952	36954	36958	VENUS PLUS X 79 Seace	62	" It 's the only known substitute for experience , "
36960	37112	36954	36958	VENUS PLUS X 79 Seace	62	" and a sight faster . I want to stress the fact that this is n't just indoctrination . It would be impossible to impress untruth on a mind with the cerebrostyle , however logical , because sooner or later a conclusion would be presented which was contrary to the observed facts , and the whole thing would fall apart . And likewise , the cerebrostyle is not a sort of ' mind probe ' designed to dig out your inner secrets . We have been able to distinguish between the dynamic , or sequence - in - action currents of the mind , and the static , or storage parts . If a teacher records the alcohol - and - water se quence to its conclusion , the student is not going to get the teacher 's life - history and tastes in fruit along with his lesson in physics . "

38206	38266	38267	38267	Seace	62	” Charlie glanced thoughtfully at Philos , who had been waiting for him at the foot of the invisible lift , as always appearing as if he just happened to be there , as always with the alert dark eyes sparkling with some secret amusement ... or perhaps just knowledge ... or perhaps something quite different , like grief . “
38269	38273	38267	38267	Seace	62	” said Charlie , "
38296	38316	38317	38317	I	0	" Philos laughed . As Charlie has noticed before , Philos bad 82 VENUS PLUS X a good laugh . “
38320	38325	38317	38317	I	0	” said the Ledom , “
38341	38357	38336	38337	The Children	1498	” Charlie looked across at the Medical One , and up at the Science One . "

38477	38563	38452	38452	you	0	” Philos pointed -at a cottage . It lay in a fold of the hills , surrounded by that impeccable greensward , and up its white , low walls , flaming flowering vines grew . Its roof was pitched and gabled , brown with a dusting of green . There were flower - boxes at the windows , and at one end , the white wall yielded to the charm of fieldstone , tapering up to be a chimney , from which blue smoke drifted . "
38569	38586	38452	38452	you	0	” Charlie sniffed the warm bright air , and felt the green springiness under his feet . “
38589	38611	38452	38452	you	0	” They walked toward the distant cottage , taking a winding course through the gently rolling land . Once Charlie said , “
38615	38617	38452	38452	you	0	” . "
38622	38634	38618	38618	You	834	” said Philos . He seemed taut with expectancy and delight . "

38646	38656	38618	38618	You	834	” said Charlie , and thought immediately of Laura . "
38661	38665	38618	38618	You	834	” said Philos , “

38685	38711	38675	38675	I	0	” Philos demanded . Then he stopped and with great gravity took Charlie 's arm and turned him to face him , and said slowly , “
38723	38737	38675	38675	I	0	" Startled , Charlie could think of no response except , at last , “
38741	38898	38675	38675	I	0	” which Philos accepted . They walked on . The sense of expectancy somehow increased . It was Philos , of course ; the Ledom radiated something . ... Charlie remembered having seen a movie once , a sort of travelogue . The camera was placed on an airplane which flew low over plains country , over houses and fields , with the near land rushing past , and the musical background was as expectant as this . The film gave you no warning of the absolute enormity that was to come ; for time and distance which seemed forever , there was only the flat country and the speed , and the occaVENUS PLUS X 83 sional road and farm , but the music grew in tension and suspense , until with an absolute explosion of color and of perspective , you found yourself hurtling over the lip of the Grand Canyon of the Colorado . “
38902	39039	38675	38675	I	0	” said Philos . Charlie looked , and saw a young Ledom in a yellow silken tunic , leaning against a rocky outcropping in a steep bank not far ahead . As they approached , Charlie expected anything but what actually happened ; when one meets a fellow being , there is reaction , interaction of some kind , whether one is homo sap . or Ledom or beaver ; but here there was none . The Ledom in yellow stood on one leg , back against the rock , one foot against the other knee , both hands clasped under the raised thigh . The rather fine - drawn face was averted , turned neither directly toward them nor away , and the eyes were half - closed . Charlie said in a low voice , "
39043	39044	38675	38675	I	0	" "
39047	39149	39150	39150	I	0	" hissed Philos . They walked unhurriedly past the standing figure . Philos veered close and , signalling to Charlie to be silent , passed a hand back and forth close to the half - closed eyes . There was no response . Philos and Charlie walked on , Charlie turning frequently to look back . All the while they were in sight , there was no movement but the gentle shifting of the silken garment in the light breeze . When at last a turn put a shoulder of the hill between them and the entranced creature , Charlie said , “

39733	39762	39763	39763	You	0	” Charlie cried angrily , and then checked himself . The likes of Philos could not be reached by rage ; he sensed that , and said bluntly , “
39785	39809	39810	39810	I	0	” Disarmingly , Philos cut it out , then and there ; his sharp eyes softened and in complete sincerity , he apologized . “
39814	39818	39810	39810	I	0	” he added . “

39935	39998	39911	39911	I	0	” In spite of himself Charlie laughed with him , and they went on . A few hundred yards from the cottage , Philos turned him sharp right and they climbed a rather steep slope to its crest , and followed it until they came to a knoll . Philos , in the lead , stopped and waved Charlie up beside him . “
40008	40237	40238	40239	The Children	1498	” Charlie found himself looking down on the cottage . He could now see that it was at the brink of a wide valley , part wooded , ( or was that orchard ? They would n't do anything in straight lines here ! ) and part cultivated fields . Around and between the fields and woods , the country was as parklike as it had been by the big buildings . Scattered throughout were more cottages , widely separated , each unique - timber , fieldstone , a sort of white stucco , plaster , even what looked like turf — and each widely separated from all the others , some by as much as half a mile . He could see more than twentyfive of the cottages from their vantage point , and there were probably more . Like scattered , diverse flower - petals , the bright garments of the people showed here and there through the woods and fields , on the green borders , and on the banks of the two small streams which wandered down the valley . The silver sky domed it all , falling to hills all about ; it seemed then to be a dish - shaped mesa , and higher than anything around it , for he could see nothing beyond the gentle ramparts of the valley itself . “
40243	40345	40238	40239	The Children	1498	" said Philos . Charlie looked down past the growing thatch of the cottage below , to the yard and pond before it . He began to hear the singing , and he saw the children . * V.r . and Mrs. Herbert Raile are shopping for children 's clothes in the dry - goods wing of an enormous highway supermarket . The children are outside in the car . It is hot out there so they are hurrying . Herb 86 VENUS PLUS X pushes a supermarket shopping cart . Jeanette fans through the stacks of clothes on the counters . "
40361	40386	40238	40239	The Children	1498	" She takes three for Davy , size Five , and three for Karen , size Three , and drops them in the cart . “
40391	40500	40238	40239	The Children	1498	” She marches briskly off , with Herb and the shopping cart in her wake . He unthinkingly follows the international rules of the road : a vessel approaching from the right has the right of way ; a vessel making a turn loses the right of way . He yields right of way twice on these principles and has to run to catch up . A wheel squeaks . When he runs it screams . Jeanette proceeds purposively right , straight ahead three aisles , and left two , and then stops dead . A little breathless , Herb and squeak regain her aura . She demands , "
40506	40510	40238	40239	The Children	1498	” He points . “
40518	40547	40238	40239	The Children	1498	” They had early passed within an aisle of it . Jeanette tsks in her haste and retraces her quick steps . Herb wheels and squeaks after her . “
40571	40585	40563	40564	Louie Graham	82	” murmurs Jeanette like one in prayer , and passes up the denim . “
40595	40601	40563	40564	Louie Graham	82	" She takes two pairs . “
40605	40646	40563	40564	Louie Graham	82	” She takes two pairs , and drops them into the cart , and hurries off . Herb squeaks , stops , screams , and squeaks after her . She takes two turns left , proceeds three aisles and stops . “
40653	40654	40660	40662	CHILDREN 'S SANDALS	852	” “
40664	40708	40660	40662	CHILDREN 'S SANDALS	852	" pants Herb , pointing . Jeanette tsks , and sprints to the sandals . By the time he overtakes her she has picked out two pairs of red sandals with yellow - white gum soles , and drops them into the cart . “
40711	40718	40660	40662	CHILDREN 'S SANDALS	852	” gurgles Herb , almost laughing . “
40723	40729	40660	40662	CHILDREN 'S SANDALS	852	” she says in midstride . “

40762	40795	40760	40760	dear	854	” she says , moving off . He maneuvers a stretch in which , briefly , he can wheel beside her close enough to be heard over the squeaks , and says , “
40804	40805	40801	40801	women	1391	" “
40812	40820	40801	40801	women	1391	” she says , passing a counter . “

40981	40994	40979	40979	honey	231	" She rapidly scatters the contents of a bin called Size 5 . “
40999	41014	40979	40979	honey	231	” She holds up a small pair of trunks , navy with red piping . “

41025	41063	40979	40979	honey	231	” she says ; perhaps this is a sequitur but he does not investigate . He rummages through Size 3 and comes up with a similar pair of trunks , but about as large as his palm . “

41218	41227	41205	41205	I	0	” She displays her find , and giggles . “
41236	41889	41205	41205	I	0	” She drops it into the shopping cart , and they squeak swiftly toward the checkout , with their six T - shirts , four khaki shorts , two pairs of red sandals with yellow - white gum soles , one size 5 navy swimming trunks , one size 3 perfect miniature bikini . THE CHILDREN , MORE THAN a dozen of them , were in and around the pond , and as they played , they sang . Charlie had never heard such singing . He had heard much worse , and , as singing goes , some better ; but he had never heard singing like this . It was something like the soft sound made by one of those tops which gives out an organ - toned chord , and then , slowing , shifts to another , related chord . Sometimes such toys are designed to issue a single constant note , which sounds as part of the two or even three chords as they modulate . These children , some in adolescence , some mere toddlers , sang that way ; and the extraordinary thing about it was that , of the fifteen or so voices which at one time or another involved themselves , never more than four , or very occasionally five , sang at once . The chord of music hung over the group , sometimes bunched over a cluster of small brown bodies , then moving by degrees across the pond to the other side , then spreading itself out so that alto notes came from the left , soprano from the right . One could almost watch the chord as it condensed , rarefied , hovered , spread , leapt , changing its hues all the while in compelling sequences , tonic , then holding the keynote reinforced by two voices in unison while the background shifted to make it a dominant , one fell away to a seventh , and then , rather than drop back to the tonic , one voice would flat a halftone and the chord , turned blue , would float there as the relative minor . Then a fifth , a sixth , a ninth sweet discord and it would right itself as the tonic chord in another key — all so easy , so true and sweet . Most of the children were naked ; all were straight - limbed , clear - eyed , firm - bodied . To Charlie 's as yet uneducated eye they all looked like little girls . They seemed not to concentrate at all on their music ; they played , splashed , ran about , built with mud and sticks and colored bricks ; three of them threw a ball amongst them . They spoke to each other in their dove - like language , called , squeaked as they ran and were almost caught , squealed too , and one cried like - well , like a child , when he fell ( and was ever so quickly caught up by three others , comforted , kissed , given a toy , teased to laughter ) 88 VENUS PLUS X 89 but over it all hung that changing three - part , four - part , sometimes five - part chord , built by one and another in a pause , between breaths , in midair diving into the water , between spoken question and answer . Charlie had heard something like this before , in the central court of the Medical One , but not so bright , so easy ; and he was to hear this chordal music wherever he went in Ledom , wherever the Ledom gathered in larger groups ; it hung over the Ledom as the fog of their body - heat hangs over the reindeer herds in the frigid Lapland plains . “
41897	41898	41892	41892	they	873	” “
41904	41911	41899	41899	They	873	" said Philos , eyes shining . “
42028	42211	42023	42023	me	0	" Softly , but clearly , he sang three notes rapidly : do , sol , mi .... And as if the notes were bright play - bullets , shot to each of three children , three children picked them up — one child for each note , so that the notes come in as arpeggio and were held as chord ; then they were repeated , again as arpeggio and again held ; and now one child - Charlie saw which one , too ; it was one standing waist - deep in the pond - changed one note , so that the arpeggio was do , fa mi ... and immediately afterward re , fa mi , and suddenly fa , do la ... so it went , progressing , modulating , inverting ; augmented , with sixths added , with ninths added , with demanding sevenths asking the tonic but mischievously getting the related minor instead . At length the arpeggio was lost as an arpeggio , and the music eased itself back to a steady , constantly changing chord “
42219	42248	42023	42023	me	0	” breathed Charlie , wishing he could say it as beautifully as the beauty he heard , and disliking himself for his inability . Philos said , gladiy , “
42253	42320	42321	42321	He	876	” Grocid , a scarlet cloak ribboned about his throat , the rest of it airborne , had just emerged from the cottage . He turned and looked up , waved and sang the three notes Philos had sung ( and again they were caught , braided , turned and tossed among the children ) and laughed . 90 VENUS PLUS X Philos said to Charlie , “
42337	42341	42321	42321	He	876	" He called , "
42348	42393	42396	42396	Philos	101	” Grocid gladly waved them in , and they plunged down the steep slope . Grocid snatched up a child and came to meet them . The child sat astride his shoulders , crowing with joy and batting at the billows of the cloak . "
42417	42455	42415	42415	you	101	” To Charlie 's astonishment , Grocid and Philos kissed . When Grocid approached him , Charlie stiffly stuck out his hand ; with instant understanding , Grocid took it , pressed it , let it go . “
42460	42877	42458	42458	Anaw	152	" said Grocid , brushing the side of the child 's cheek with his hair . The youngster laughed , buried its face in the thick mass , extricated a laughing eye , and with it peeped at Charlie . Charlie laughed back . They went together into the house . Dilating bulkheads ? Concealed lighting ? Anti - gravity tea - trays ? Self - frosting breakfast food ? Automatic floors ? No . The room was near enough to being rectangular as it needed to be to satisfy eyes which had become , Charlie suddenly realized , hungry for a straight line . The ceiling was low and raftered , and it was cool there — not the antiseptic and unemotional kiss of conditioned air , but the coolness of vine - awninged windows , low ceilings , and thick walls ; it was the natural seepage of the earth itself 's cool subcutaneous layers . And here were chairs - one of hand - rubbed wood , three of rustic design , with curves of tough liana and slats and spokes of whole or split tree - trunks . The floor was flagstone , levelled and ground smooth and grouted with , of all things , a glazed purple cement , and brilliant hand - tied rag rugs set it off . On a low table was a gigantic wooden bowl , turned from a single piece of hardwood , and a graceful but very rugged beverage set - a pitcher and seven or eight earthenware mugs . In the bowl was a salad , beautifully arranged in an elaborate star - pattern , of fruits , nuts , and vegetables . There were pictures on the walls , mostly in true - earth colors - greens , browns , orange , and the yellow - tinted reds and red - tinted blues of flowers and ripe fruit . Most were representational and pleasingly so ; some were abstract , a few impressionistic . One especially caught his eye ; a scene of two Ledom , with the observation angle strangely high and askew , so that you seemed to be looking down past the shoulder of the standing figure to the reclining one below . The latter seemed to be broken in some unspecified way , ill and in VENUS PLUS X pain ; the whole composition was oddly blurred , and its instant impact was of being seen through scalding tears . "
42886	42946	42878	42878	I	0	” It was the other head of the Children 's One , Nasive , standing by him and smiling . Charlie turned away from his contemplation of the picture and saw the Ledom , in a cloak exactly the same as Grocid 's , extending his hand . Charlie shook it and let it slip away ; he said , “
42956	42957	42951	42951	I	0	" “
42964	42968	42958	42958	We	878	” said Nasive . “
42983	43008	42979	42979	I	0	" Charlie could have nodded and let it go , but in this place , with these people , he wanted to be honest . “
43021	43025	43026	43026	We	878	” he said . “
43041	43042	42979	42979	I	0	" “
43075	43341	43342	43342	Illew	157	" Grocid filled all - but - rimless earthenware plates and passed them around , while Nasive poured a golden liquid into the mugs . It was , Charlie discovered , a sharp but honey - flavored beverage , probably a sort of mead , cool but not cold , with a spicy aftertaste and a late , gentle kick . The salad , which he ate with a satin - finished hardwood fork which had two short , narrow tines and one broad long one with a very adequate cutting edge , was eleven ways delicious ( one for each variety of food it contained ) and it strained his self - control to the utmost not to a ) gobble and b ) demand more . They talked ; he did not join in very much , although aware of their courteous care to say that which might include or interest him , or at least not to launch into anything of length which might exclude him . Fredon had weevils over the hill there . Have you seen the new inlay process Dregg 's doing ? Wood in ceramic ; you 'd swear they 'd been fireglazed together . Nariah wanted to put in for biostatic treatment of a new milkweed fiber . Eriu 's kid broke his silly leg . And meanwhile the children were in and out , miraculously never actually interrupting , but simply flashing in , receiving a nut or a piece of fruit , hovering breathlessly to ask a favor , a permission , or a fact : "
43355	43398	43399	43399	Grocid	103	" ( No ; none of the arachnids have wings . ) A flash of purple ribbon and yellow tunic , and the child is gone , to be replaced instantly by a very small and coquettish naked creature which said clearly , “
43407	43528	43399	43399	Grocid	103	" ( You got a funny face too . ) Laughing , the mite was gone . Charlie , eating with effortful slowness , watched Nasive , crouched on a nearby hassock , deftly prying a splinter out of 92 VENUS PLUS X his own hand . The hand , though graceful , was large and strong , and seeing the point of a needle - like probe excavating below the base of the middle finger , Charlie was struck by the sight of the callosities there . The flesh of the palm and the inside of the fingers seemed as tough as a stevedore 's . Charlie found himself making an effort to square this with flowing scarlet garments and "
43530	43562	43399	43399	Grocid	103	" furniture , and realized it was n't his privilege , just now , to draw such balances . But he said , thumping the sturdy arm of the rustic chair , “
43568	43569	43399	43399	Grocid	103	” “
43573	43578	43581	43581	myself	0	" said Nasive cheerfully . “
43609	43610	43611	43611	I	0	” “
43615	43629	43611	43611	I	0	” said Charlie . They were brown and almost gold , swirled together . "
43650	43651	43611	43611	I	0	” "
43654	43658	43660	43660	you	0	" said Nasive . “
43669	43678	43660	43660	you	0	" He glanced at Charlie 's empty plate . “
43684	43693	43694	43694	I	0	" Regretfully , Charlie laid the plate aside . “
43701	43775	43694	43694	I	0	” They rose and went toward a door at the back . A child half - hidden in the drapes at the back of the room darted mischievously at Nasive , who , without breaking stride , caught it up , turned it squealing upside down , very gently bumped its head on the floor , and set it on its feet again . Then grinning , he waved Charlie through the door . "
43783	43787	43776	43776	You	0	” said Charlie . “
43791	43819	43788	43789	My God	884	" said Nasive . And here again the language was shaded so that a translation must lose substance . Charlie felt that what he meant when he said “
43822	44147	43820	43821	My God	884	” was a direct response to his remark , and in no sense an expletive . Was the child his God , then ? Or ... was it the concept The Child ? The room in which they stood was a little higher than the one they had left , and wider , but utterly different from the harmonious , casual , comfortable living space . This was a workshop - a real working workshop . The floor was brick , the walls were planed but otherwise unfinished planks , milled shiplap fashion . On wooden pegs hung tools , basic tools : sledge and wedges , hammers , adze , spoke - shave , awl , drawknife , hatchet and axe , square , gauge , and levels , brace and a rack of bits , and a set of planes . Against the walls , and here and there out on the floor , were - well , call them machine tools , but they were apparently hand - fashioned , sometimes VENUS PLUS X 93 massively , from wood ! A table - saw , for example , was powered from underneath by treadles , and by a crank and connectingrod arrangement , caused a sort of sabresaw to oscillate up and down . A detachable , deep - throated frame was clamped to it , to guide the top end of the saw - blade , and was loaded with a wooden spring . There was a lathe , too , with clusters of wooden pulleys for speed adjustment , and an immense flywheel - it must have weighed five hundred pounds - made of ceramic . But it was the kiln which Nasive had brought him to see . It stood in the corner , a brick construction with a chimney above and a heavy metal door , which stood up on brick pilings . Underneath was a firepot on casters—"it
44154	44244	44245	44245	I	0	” Nasive pointed out as , with a muscular tug , he rolled it out and back under again - and mounted on it , well to one side , was a treadle - operated bellows . The outlet from the bellows led to a great floppy object which looked like a deflated bladder , which in fact it was . Nasive pumped vigorously on the treadle and the wrinkled thing sighed , tiredly got up off its back , and wobbled upright . It then began to swell . “
44261	44303	44245	44245	I	0	” said Nasive , his face glowing . He stopped pumping and pulled a lever a little way toward him ; Charlie heard air hissing up through the grates . He pulled it a bit more , and the air roared . “
44358	44359	44354	44354	They	892	” “
44364	44369	44354	44354	They	892	” said Charlie sincerely , "
44382	44383	44354	44354	They	892	” "
44388	44432	44354	44354	They	892	" said Nasive agreeably — and not by one word did he enlarge on it . Charlie looked admiringly about him , at the neat stacks of lumber which had obviously been milled here , the sturdy bracing of the wooden machines , the “
44436	44473	44354	44354	They	892	" said Nasive . He threw a clamp from the chuck end of the lathe ways and gave the ways a shove upward . Hinged at the tailstock end , it swung upright and latched into place “
44478	44490	44354	44354	They	892	” cried Charlie , delighted . He pointed to the flywheel . “
44505	44512	44498	44498	you	896	” Nasive nodded toward the kiln . “
44559	44560	44562	44567	the people dancing on the treadle	902	" "
44569	44573	44562	44567	the people dancing on the treadle	902	” laughed Charlie . "
44584	44589	44591	44591	you	896	” Nasive laughed back . “
44631	44632	44633	44633	I	0	" "
44639	44793	44633	44633	I	0	” said Charlie , looking at the flywheel but thinking of invisible elevators , time machines , a fingertip device which , he had been told , could take large bites out of hillsides and transport what it bit wherever it was wanted . The fleeting thought occurred to him that perhaps these people out here did n't know what they had back at the big Ones . Then he recalled that it was at the Medical One he had first seen Grocid and Nasive . So then the thought came to him that , knowing what they had at the Ones , they were denied these things , and must plod from cottage to field , and work up those case - hardened callouses , while Seace and Mielwis magicked ice - cold breakfast fruits from holes in the wall by their beds . Ab well . Them as has , gits . “
44805	44806	44633	44633	I	0	" "
44812	44816	44633	44633	I	0	” said Nasive . “
44821	45140	44633	44633	I	0	" He led the way to a door in the outside wall , and they stepped through into a garden . Four or five of the children were tumbling about on the grass , and one was up a tree . They shouted , cooed , crowed at the sight of Nasive , flew to him and away ; while he talked he would tousle one , spin another around , answer a third with a wink and a tickle . Charlie Johns saw the statue . He thought , would you call this Madonna and Child ? The adult figure , with some material that draped like fine linen thrown loosely half around it , knelt , looking upward . The figure of the child stood , also looking upward , with a transcendant , even ecstatic expression on its face . The child was nude , but its flesh tones were perfectly reproduced , as were the adult 's , whose garment was shot through with all colors possible to a wood fire . The two remarkable features about this sculpture were , first , that the figure of the adult was three feet high , and that of the child over eleven feet ! ; second , that the entire group was one monstrous single piece of perfectly glazed , faultlessly fired terra cotta . Charlie had to ask Nasive to repeat himself , saying something about kilns , as he was swept with wonderment at the beauty of this work of art , its finish , but most of all its VENUS PLUS X 95 symbolism . The small adult kneeling in worship of the giant child , rapt face fixed on the huge standing figure ; and the child , in a rapture of its own , detached from the adult and aspiring upward ... somewhere . . . higher in any case . "
45149	45238	45143	45143	I	0	” Nasive was saying . Charlie , still spellbound , scanned the great lovely work , wondering if it had been fired in pieces and erected . But no ; the glaze was flawless , without line or join from top to bottom . Why , even the base , made and colored like a great mass of flowers , a regular mound of petals , was glazed ! Well then ! They did get a crack at that A - field magic after all ! Nasive said , “
45292	45293	45270	45274	More than two hundred children	905	” "

45400	45404	45405	45405	Nasive	102	” said Charlie . “
45418	45419	45423	45424	The Maker	910	” “
45426	45465	45466	45467	The Maker	910	" said Nasive . ( In the language , that was creator , and also the one who accomplishes . The doer . ) The adult adoring the child . The child in adoration of something ... else . “
45469	45470	45466	45467	The Maker	910	” “
45483	45484	45485	45486	The child	1854	” “
45489	45499	45485	45486	The child	1854	" Nasive laughed , that full , easy , not “
45501	45515	45485	45486	The child	1854	” kind of laugh which seemed to come so easily to these people . “
45531	45586	45485	45486	The child	1854	” Charlie laughed with him , but as they left , looked back over his shoulder at the gleaming terra cotta , he knew that Nasive might have said more . And indeed Nasive seemed to understand that , and his feelings about it , for he touched Charlie 's elbow and said softly , “
45599	45702	45594	45594	you	919	” Charlie wrenched himself away , but his eyes were full of that exquisite , devout pair shining in the garden . As they 96 VENUS PLUS X crossed the workshop , Charlie asked himself , But why is the child bigger than the parent ? ... And knew he had asked it aloud when Nasive , stepping into the living room , and incidentally snatching the same youngster they had seen before delightedly cowering in the drapes , and as before scooping it up , turning it over and bumping its little head on the floor until it hiccupped with laughter : "
45711	45722	45705	45705	children	525	” Well ... in this language , as in English , “
45724	45727	45594	45594	you	919	" could mean “
45729	45789	45790	45790	He	921	" ... oh , he 'd think about it later . With shining eyes , he looked at the faces in the room , and then felt a very real pang of regret . One ought not to see such a thing , and then have no one new to show it to . Philos understood , and said , “
45798	45799	45790	45790	He	921	” “
45806	45864	45800	45801	Charlie Johns	67	" Charlie felt enormously pleased , but , not being able to see his own shining eyes , did not for the life of him know what he was being thanked for . Ihe Brute begins ominously , straddle - gaited , hunch - shouldered , to approach the bed against which She cowers in her negligee . "
45870	45979	45800	45801	Charlie Johns	67	” she cries in an Italian accent , whereupon the camera dollies in with the lurch of The Brute , becoming The Brute , and all the blood - and - flesh bugs within the steeland - chrome beetles ranked up before the gargantuan screen of the drive - in theater , bat their eyes and thrum with the blood in their flesh . The very neon - stained air around the popcorn machines is tumid with it ; hooded dead headlights in row upon row seem to bulge with it . When the camera dollies in close enough to make it possible , for this season cleavage is "
45981	45986	45800	45801	Charlie Johns	67	" but the areola is “
45989	46104	45800	45801	Charlie Johns	67	" The Brute 's big hand darts in from off - camera , smites her ivory cheek stingingly ( the straddle - gaited lumbering music stings too ) and drops below the frame of the picture , whereupon we hear silk ripping . Her face , still close up , forty - three tinted feet six inches from tangled hair to dimpled chin , is carried backward by the camera or The Brute and pressed to the satin pillow , whereupon the dark shadow of The Brute 's VENUS PLUS X 97 head begins to cover her face with the implacable precision of the studio sound - man 's hand on a volume knob . "
46115	46250	45800	45801	Charlie Johns	67	” Herb Raile , behind the wheel of his automobile , is at last made aware of a rythmic wrestling going on beside him . Although Karen is fast asleep on the back seat , Davy , who at this hour is ordinarily dead to the world , is blaringly wide awake . Jeanette has a half - nelson on the boy and with her other hand is attempting to cover his eyes . Davy is chinning himself on her wrist as on a horizontal bar , and both of them are , in spite of and during this exercize , snatching what avid glances at the screen as they can . Herb Raile , snatching what avid glances he can at the screen while analyzing this activity , says without turning his head , “
46256	46257	45800	45801	Charlie Johns	67	” “
46265	46284	45800	45801	Charlie Johns	67	" she hisses . She is a little out of breath from one or another of these stimuli . "
46290	46308	46288	46288	me	0	” screams shatteringly the She on the screen , then spasms her face and closes her eyes : "
46319	46323	46288	46288	me	0	" she moans , “
46337	46345	46346	46346	I	0	" Davy rips down the blinding hand : "
46350	46351	46352	46352	You	0	” “
46362	46387	46359	46359	I	0	” Herb barks imperatively , watching the screen . Davy sharply nips his mother 's forearm . She utters a small scream and says , “
46391	46503	46359	46359	I	0	” In not less than seventy feet of super - polychrome threeand - a - quarter - to - one - aspect - ratio tumble - sounded explication , the screen rapidly and succinctly explains that due to an early misunderstanding She and The Brute were actually really and truly married the whole time , and when She has finished broken in passion and in English as well explaining to The Brute that the clear source of their excesses is the legality of their loving , the screen dissolves in a blare of light and a blaze of trumpets , leaving the audience limp and blinking in the here and now . “
46514	46519	46504	46504	You	0	” says Herb accusingly . "
46531	46674	46527	46527	He	923	” There is an interlude wherein it seems to dawn on Davy that he has done something punishable ; he need not know what to get it over with , which is done by weeping and being comforted by raspberry sherbet and a shrimp roll . The sherbet , initially on a stick , presents its own problem by leaving same ; after a moment of watching it enfold his numb but apparently hot fingertips while it drips exactly on the crease of his trousers , Herb solves the problem by putting it 98 VENUS PLUS X entire into his mouth , which makes the bridge of his nose ache and by which Davy allows he has been robbed . This is not a crisis after all because the lights dim and the screen flares up again for the second feature . . "
46681	46689	46527	46527	He	923	” says Herb after the second minute . “
46710	46711	46707	46707	you	926	” "
46720	46724	46718	46718	honey	231	” Jeanette says . “
46731	46780	46726	46726	you	231	" Davy sees all right the fight at the cliff edge , the falling body , the old man lying broken at the foot of the cliff , the evil cowpoke bending over him , the gush of good bright red blood from the old man 's mouth : "
46790	46798	46799	46799	You	0	" ; the evil cowpoke 's laughing , “
46814	46901	46801	46802	Chuck Fritch	160	" ; his drawing of the .45 , the roaring shots , the twitch of the old man 's body as the slugs rip into him and his agonized grunts , the grin on the evil cowboy 's face as he stomps the old man 's face only they keep that specific off camera , but afterward you can watch him kick the body the rest of the way down into the canyon . Flashback to a dirt street with duckboard sidewalks . Herb says thoughtfully , “
46929	48221	46920	46920	they	929	” | HEY WENT TO WOMBEW 's house , the dooryard of which was surrounded by strong and intricate basketwork , which was essentially nothing more than poles driven into the ground and vines woven around them ; Wombew , a hawk - nosed young adult , showed Charlie how this was not merely a fence , but was integral with the house , for the walls were built of it too , and then plastered with a clayey mud from the neighborhood — the timeless mud - andwattle construction — which when quite dry had been coated with a species of whitewash which was not white , but violet . The roof was thatched and planted with the thick - matted , mowing grass found all through Ledom . The house was lovely , especially in its interior planning , for mud - and - wattle need make no compromise with standard lumber lengths , and VENUS PLUS X 99 the more curved the walls , the more stable they are , just as a curved piece of paper may be stood on edge . Grocid and Nasive and their children came along and helped show Charlie Wombew 's treasures . They went to Aborp 's house , which had been built of rammed earth , wooden forms having been set up and the moistened earth put between them and compacted by hand with the end of a heavy timber wielded by four strong Ledom standing on the top of the forms . Once it had dried , the forms could be removed . Like the wattle building , this too could be designed very flexibly . Grocid and Nasive and their children and Wombew 's children and Wombew came along . They went to Obtre 's house , which was made of cut stone , built up in square modules . Each module had its domed roof , which was made with great simplicity . You fill the four walls right to the top with earth , mound it to suit , and lay on plaster until it is nearly a foot thick . Once it is set , you then dig out all the earth . It is said that this kind of house , with this roof , will stand a thousand years . Obtre and Obtre 's children joined them as they went on . Edec had a moss - chinked log house , Viomor lived right inside a hill , part shored and panelled with hand - rubbed wood , part cut from the living rock . Piante had a fieldstone house with a sod roof , and all the walls were covered with splendid tapestries — not draped , but applied flat so their marvellous pictures and designs could be read ; and in the back , Charlie saw the hand - made loom which had made them all , and for a while watched Piante and his mate work the loom , while two tiny children threw the shuttle . And Piante 's children and Piante joined them , and his mate , and so did Viomor 's family and Edec 's ; and as they crossed the park areas , people in their bright garments , windblown children and leggy adolescents , came out of the fields and orchards , dropping hoes and mattocks , pruning knives and machetes at the borders , and came along . As the crowd grew , so grew the music . It was never louder ; it grew larger instead . So at last , visiting and gaining as it went , the multitude , and Charlie Johns , came to the place of worship . eanette flings herself unhappily on the neat afternoon bed . What makes me that way ? She has just turned away a home improvement services salesman . Which is all right in itself . Nobody asks these eager beavers to ring your doorbell and they have to take their chances . Nobody in her right mind is going to buy what she does n't want , and nowadays you have to get it straight in your head what you do n't want and stick to it , or they 'll pull you down , bleed you . It was n't that ; it was the way she had brushed the man off . She had acted this way before and doubtless she would again , and that is what is making her feel so rotten . Did she have to be that abrupt ? Did she have to give the icy stare , the cold word , the notquite - but - very - nearly slammed door ? None of that was her , was Jeanette . Could she have done it get rid of him , that is -acting like Jeanette instead of like some moving - picture parody of the hard life of a traveling salesman ? Sure she could have . She sits up . Maybe this time she can think it through and it wo n't bother her ever again . She has gotten rid of unwanted sales people , and gotten out of similar situations , many , many times before by being Jeanette . A smile , a little lie , something about the baby 's waking up or I think I hear the phone ; easy , and no harm done . My husband bought one just day before yesterday . Oh I wish you 'd come around last week ; I just won one in a contest . Who 's to call her a liar ? They go away and nobody 's hurt . But then , once in a while , like this one just now , she curls her lip and spits an icicle . And like just now , she stands by the not - quite - slammed door and bites her long coral thumbnail , and then goes to peer unseen through the marquisette curtain , being careful not to move it or touch it , and she watches the way he walks away ; she can tell , by the way he walks down the path , that he 's hurt . She 's hurt and he 's hurt , and who gets anything for it ? She feels rotten . 100 VENUS PLUS X 101 Why especially him ? He was n't offensive . Far from it . A nice - looking fellow with a good smile , strong teeth , neat clothes , and he was n't about to shove his foot in the door . He treated her like a lady who might be helped by what he was selling ; he was selling that , and not himself . You know , she tells herself , if he had been a real crumb , a winking , eyebrow - waggling creep who 'd goggle at the bottom end of your bra strap and make a kissing noise , you 'd have told him off in the nice way — a fast , light , harmless brush . Well , then , she tells herself , apalled , that 's the answer . You liked him ; that 's why you threw the freeze . She sits on the edge of the bed looking at that idea , and then she closes her eyes and lets her imagination get as foolish as it likes , imagining him coming in , touching her ; imagining him right here with her . And that rings no bell . It really does n't . What she liked about the man was n't anything like that at all .. “
48233	48485	48225	48225	you	930	" she demands of herself aloud . There is no answer . It is an article of faith with her . If you like a man , it has to be because you want him . Whoever heard of it any other way ? People just do n't go around liking people on sight unless . And if she ca n't feel that she wants him , it 's one of those subconscious whatcha - ma - callits ; she 's just not letting herself know it . She does n't want to want some other guy besides Herb , but she must . So she 's rotten . She falls back down on the bed and tells herself she ought to be hung up by the thumbs . She 's rotten clear through . HE FEAST WAS ON A MOUNtain - at least , it was the highest hill Charlie had yet seen . Nearly a hundred Ledom were waiting there when Philos and Charlie and the great crowd arrived . In a grove of dark - leaved trees , on the faultless greensward , food was arrayed , laid out Hawaiian fashion on platters of woven fresh leaves and broad grasses . No Japanese flower - arranger ever did a more careful 102 VENUS PLUS X job than these gifted people with their food . Each platter and clever green basket was a construction in color and form , contrast and harmony ; and the smells were symphonic . · "
48489	48526	48487	48487	yourself	932	” smiled Philos . Charlie looked around him dazedly . The Ledom were coming from every direction , filtering through the trees , greeting each other with glad cries . There were frequent embraces , kisses . "
48529	48530	48487	48487	yourself	932	” "
48539	48783	48536	48536	everybody	419	” They stepped through the swirling crowd and seated themselves under a tree . Before them were lovely mounds of food , laid up in graspable , bite - sized portions , and so beautifully arranged that until Philos reached , and disturbed a symmetry , Charlie had n't the heart to begin . A pretty child came by with a tray balanced on its head , and a half - dozen mugs apparently designed for the purpose ; they were shaped like truncated cones with wide bases . Philos held out a hand and the child skipped toward them ; Philos took two mugs and kissed the child , who laughed and danced away . Charlie took a mug and sipped ; it was like cool applejuice with peach overtones . He began to eat with enthusiasm . The food tasted as good as it looked - a most extreme statement . When he was able to slow down enough to look about again , he found the grove thick with a pleasant tension ; perhaps it was the cloud of music which hovered over the people that exemplified it most , for it lay in a wide chordal whisper , surging with a pulsation that seemed to become more regular by the moment . One thing that struck Charlie was the fact that a great many people seemed to be feeding each other rather than themselves . He asked about it . "
48808	48842	48843	48843	I	0	” Charlie recalled his odd touch of frustration in the realization that there had been , for him , no one to show the great terra - cotta statue to , and said , “
48848	48856	48843	48843	I	0	" He looked at his companion suddenly . "
48875	48884	48861	48861	me	0	” A strange expression crossed Philos ' face . “
48892	48897	48861	48861	me	0	” he said warmly . “
48910	48940	48941	48944	A lot of people	938	” ( Was that a slight rush of color in his neck and cheeks ? And what was it ? Anger ? Charlie felt suddenly unwilling to pry . ) "
48946	48957	48941	48944	A lot of people	938	" he commented after a while . VENUS PLUS X 103 "
48962	48963	48941	48944	A lot of people	938	" “
48969	48970	48941	48944	A lot of people	938	” "
48993	48999	48985	48985	you	935	” Puzzled , Charlie said , “
49003	50115	48985	48985	you	935	" They fell silent , listening . Softer and softer became the giant manifold music of the people , humming a series of close , and closely related chords . There crept into it a strange staccato , and looking about him , Charlie saw that some of them were gently tapping themselves , and sometimes their companions , on the base of the throat . It gave the voices a strange thrum , which at last took on a very definite rhythm , rapid but distinct . It seemed an eight - beat , with a slight emphasis on the first and fourth . On this was imposed a low four - tone melody , which cycled , cycled , cycled ... everyone seemed to crouch , to lean forward a little , to tense . .. Suddenly came the clarion of a powerful soprano voice , a very cascade of notes , bursting upward like a writhing firework from the drone of the bass melody , and subsiding . It was repeated either from far off in the grove , or from a small voice near by ; it was impossible to tell . Two tenors , by some magic striking in a major third apart , repeated the explosion of notes in harmony , and as it faded and fell , another strong voice , a blue - cloaked Ledom seated near Charlie , caught it up and blew it skyward again , this time stripping it of its accidentals and graces and all its glissandi , giving it up in its purest form , six clear notes . There was an excited rustle all about , as of appreciation , and a half - dozen scattered voices repeated the six - note theme in unison , then again repeated it . On the second of the six notes , someone else was inspired to start the theme right there ; it became fugal , and voice after voice took it up ; it burst and fell , burst and fell , interwoven and complex and thrilling . All the while the bass susurrus , with its throat - thumping irregular rhythm , lay under the music , swelling and sighing , swelling greater and drawing back . Then with a movement as explosive as that first soprano statement , a nude figure came spinning down toward them , weaving in and out between the tree - trunks and among the people ; spinning so fast that the body contours were a blur , yet sure - footedly avoiding every obstacle . The spinning Ledom leapt high right by Philos , and came to earth kneeling , face and arms spread on the soft sward . Another came spinning , then another ; soon the dark wood was alive with movement , with the swirl of the cloaks and headdresses some wore , with 104 VENUS PLUS X the flash of bodies and blurring limbs . Charlie saw Philos spring to his feet ; to his amazement he found himself standing , crouching , buffeted by the rising current of sound and motion . It became an effort not to fling himself into it as into a sea . He drew back finally and clung to the bole of a tree , gasping ; for he had an overriding fear that his unschooled feet would never stay under him in the whirling press ; that they would be as inadequate to shift and change as were his ears to contain all that was happening in the air about , as were his bewildered eyes to absorb the rush and patterning of those bodies . It became , for him , a broken series of partial but sharply focussed pictures ; the swift turn of a torso ; the tense , ecstatic lifting of a fever - blinded head , with the silky hair falling away from the face , and the body trembling ; the shrill cry of a little child in transport , running straight through the pattern of the dance , arms outstretched and eyes closed , while the frantic performers , apparently unthinkingly , made way by hairsbreadth after hairsbreadth until a dancer swung about and caught up the infant , threw it , and it was plucked out of the air and whirled up again , and once more , to be set down gently at the edge of the dance . At some point unnoted by him , the bass drone had become a roar , and the rhythm , instead of resulting from the subtle tapping of the pharynx , had become a savage beat , furious fists on unnerved thorax and abdomen . Charlie was shouting . ... Philos was gone . ... A wave of something was generated in the grove , and was released ; he could feel it rush him and dissipate ; it was as tangible as the radiation from an opened furnace door , but it was not heat . It was not anything he had ever felt , imagined , or experienced before . . . except perhaps by himself ... oh never by himself ; it was with Laura . It was not sex ; it was a thing for which sex is one of the expressions . And at this its peak , the harmonious tumult altered in kind , though not at all in quality ; the interweaving flesh of the Ledom became a frame encircling the children - so many , many childrenwho had somehow formed themselves into a compact group ; they stood proud , even the tiniest ones , proud and knowing and deeply happy , while all about , the Ledom worshipped them , and sang . They did not sing of the children . They did not sing to the children . It may be said in no other way but this : they sang the children . Smitty has come out to chat over the back fence - actually , it is a low stone wallwith Herb . It happens that Smitty is sick furious with Tillie over something that does not matter really . Herb has been sitting on a lawn chair under a red and white umbrella with the afternoon paper , and he is furious also , but with somewhat less sickness and impersonally as well . Congress has not only passed a particularly stupid bill , but has underscored its particular stupidity by overriding a presidential veto . Seeing Smitty , he throws down the paper and strides to the back wall . "
50119	50131	48985	48985	you	935	" he says , meaning it purely as a preliminary remark , “
50143	50144	50138	50141	dirty sons of bitches	940	” "
50149	50157	50138	50141	dirty sons of bitches	940	” is the instant , dour remark . “
50173	50290	50138	50141	dirty sons of bitches	940	” HOUGH IN LEDOM IT NEVER grew dark , it seemed darker with most of the people gone . Charlie sat on the cool green moss with his wrists on his kneecaps and his back against an olive tree , and bent his head to put his cheeks against the backs of his hands . His cheeks felt leathery , for there unaccountable tears had dried . At length he straightened up and looked at Philos , who waited patiently beside him . Philos , as though to be sure not to utter a word lest it spoil something for his guest , acknowledged him with a soft smile and a peaking of his odd eyebrows . "
50295	50385	50138	50141	dirty sons of bitches	940	" Charlie asked . Philos leaned back against the tree , and with a motion of his head indicated a group of Ledom , three adults and a half - dozen children , far down the grove , who were cheerfully picking up the mess . Over them , like an invisible swarm of magic bees , hung a cloud of music , at that moment triads , minor thirds , winging neatly upwards in formation , hovering , 105 106 VENUS PLUS X fading , winging upwards again . "
50391	50442	50138	50141	dirty sons of bitches	940	” Philos said . Charlie thought about that , and the statue called The Maker , and about as much as he dared to think about what had passed in the grove , and about the sound which dwelt about these people wherever they gathered . Philos asked , quietly , “
50455	50466	50444	50444	you	943	” Charlie shook his head and got to his feet . “
50472	50476	50467	50467	I	0	" he said . “
50481	50509	50467	50467	I	0	" said Philos . They walked to the fields , and through and by the fields and cottages , back toward the Ones , and they talked : "
50516	50526	50512	50512	you	0	” Philos laughed . It was pleasure , mostly . "
50614	50615	50624	50624	you	0	” “
50632	50648	50627	50627	I	0	" said Charlie , aware of how quaint that sounded in Ledom . The word for "
50650	50652	50624	50624	you	0	” was "
50653	50656	50627	50627	I	0	interpenetrate”-a derivation of "
50657	50675	50627	50627	I	0	exchange”—but surprisingly , shy as he might from its overtones in this place , his meaning emerged . “
50680	50681	50678	50678	children	525	" "
50764	50769	50789	50789	Charlie	67	" and he stopped . “
50773	50774	50789	50789	Charlie	67	" “
50800	50802	50804	50804	me	0	” . "
50806	50810	50811	50811	You	0	” Philos shrugged . “
50831	50841	50816	50816	We	948	" They walked in silence for a long time . “
50853	50854	50848	50851	the God you worship	952	" "
50886	50893	50884	50884	God	73	” Philos paused , choosing words . “
50956	50972	50919	50919	His	73	" He looked at Charlie , and his dark strange eyes were full of compassion . “
50992	50993	50986	50987	the Ledom	116	” "
50996	50997	50986	50987	the Ledom	116	” “
51154	51168	51192	51193	the loggers	955	” Charlie snickered ; it was the laugh of unease , like embarrassment . “
51173	51188	51192	51193	the loggers	955	” he cried in an imitation bellow , in English . Then he explained , “
51219	51227	51192	51193	the loggers	955	” Philos laughed appreciatively and without rancor . “
51297	51298	51276	51276	you	0	" “
51312	51316	51276	51276	you	0	” Philos twinkled , "
51323	51332	51321	51321	Charlie	67	” Again , Charlie was forced to laugh . “
51333	51341	51342	51342	He	67	" There 's only one Philos . ' ”
51380	51388	51354	51354	Philos	101	" What 's the matter ? Did I "
51389	51400	51401	51401	Philos	101	“ Who said that ? Mielwis , was n't it ? ”
51442	51463	51434	51434	he	101	“ Do n't feel you 've said anything wrong , Charlie . It is n't you at all . Mielwis ... "
51472	51485	51497	51497	he	101	“ Mielwis 108 VENUS PLUS X occasionally indulges in a private joke . ”
51500	51521	51522	51522	He	101	“ But about the architecture - don't you quarrel with the concept of dynamic imbalance in the face of these ? ”
51547	51553	51555	51555	Charlie	67	“ Nothing tottery about that , ”
51580	51711	51712	51712	Charlie	67	" So they 're not symbols . Or not in the sense that the big Ones are . They 're the concrete results of our profound conviction that the Ledom will never separate themselves from the land and I mean that in its widest possible sensé . Civilizations have a pernicious way of breeding whole classes and generations of people who make their livings once removed twice , ten , fifty times removed from the techniques of the hand . Men could be born , live , and die , and never move a spade of earth , or true a timber , or weave a swatch , or even see spade , adze or loom . Is n't that so , Charlie ? Was n't it so with you ? ”
51948	51958	51959	51959	Philos	101	" Such men have an extremely limited survival value , "

It could not have been very long , however , and there was , in any ordinary sense , no loss of awareness , for when the stud went chuck ! again , Philos still stood over him , smiling .

58983	59225	59638	59640	real ” women	2202	" had begun ] you can not be objective about this discussion . But try . Please try . You can not be objective about it because you have been indoctrinated , sermonized , drenched , imbued , inculcated and policed on the matter since first you wore blue booties . You come from a time and place in which the maleness of the male , and the femaleness of the female , and the importance of their difference , were matters of almost total preoccupation . Begin , then , with this and if you like , regard it as mainly a working hypothesis . Actually it is a truth , and if at the end it passes the tests of your own understanding , you will see that it is a truth . If you do not , the fault is not with you , but with your orientation : There are more basic similarities than differences between men and women . Read through an anatomy manual . A lung is a lung , a kidney a kidney in man or in woman . It may be that statistically , women 's bone - structure is lighter , the head smaller , and so on and on ; yet it is not impossible that mankind had , for many thousands of years , bred for that . But aside from such conjectures , the variations permissible to what is called “
59227	59637	59638	59640	real ” women	2202	” structure provide many examples of women who were taller , stronger , heavier - boned than most men , and men 123 124 VENUS PLUS X who were smaller , slighter , lighter than most women . Many men had larger pelvic openings than many women . In the area of the secondary sexual characteristics , it is only statistically that we can note significant differences ; for many women had more body hair than many men ; many men had higher - pitched voices than many women . ... I call again on your objectivity : suspend for a moment your conviction that the statistical majority is the norm , and examine the cases , in their vast numbers , which exist outside that probable fiction , that norm . And go on : For even ' with the sex organs themselves , variations in development - and here , admittedly , we approach the pathological — have yielded countless cases of atrophied phalli , hypertrophied clitori , perforate rathes , detached labia ... all , viewed objectively , reasonably subtle variations from the norm , and capable of producing , on an initially male or female body , virtually identical urogenital triangles . It is not my intention to state that such a situation is or should be normal — at least , not after the fourth fetal month , though up to then it is not only normal but universal -- but only to bring out to you that its occurrence is easily within the limits of what has been , since prehistory , possible to nature . Endocrinology demonstrates a number of interesting facts . Both male and female could produce male and female hormones , and did , and as a matter of fact , the preponderance of one over the other was a subtle matter indeed . Then if you throw that delicate balance out , the changes which could be brought about were drastic . In a few months you could produce a bearded and breastless lady and a man whose nipples , no longer an atrophied insigne of the very point I am making here , could be made to lactate . These are gross and extreme examples purely for illustration . There have been many women athletes who could exceed in strength , speed and skill the vast majority of men , but who were nonetheless what you might call “
59639	59672	59638	59640	real ” women	2202	” women , and many men who could , say , design clothing - traditionally a woman 's specialty - far better than most women , yet who were what you might call “
59674	59780	59638	59640	real ” women	2202	” men . For when we get into what I might broadly term cultural differences between the sexes , the subtlety of sexual distinction begins to become apparent . What say the books : Women have long hair . So have the Sikhs , whom some call the toughest breed of soldiers ever bred . So had the 18th - century cavaliers , and brocaded jackets and lace at throat and wrists as well . Women wear skirts . So does a kilted VENUS PLUS X 125 Scot , a Greek evzone , a Chinese , a Polynesian , none of whom could deserve the term "
59783	59815	59638	59640	real ” women	2202	” An objective scan of human history proliferates these examples to numbers astronomical . From place to place , and in any place from time to time , the so - called "
59817	59987	59988	59988	woman	2181	" of male and female rise like the salinity of a tidal rivermouth , mingling , separating , ebbing and regrouping ... before your first World War , cigarettes and wrist - watches were regarded as unquestionably female appurtenances ; twenty years later both were wholeheartedly adopted by the men . Europeans , especially central Europeans , were startled and very much amused to see American farmers milking cows and feeding chickens , for never in their lives had they seen that done by any but women . So it is easily seen that the sexual insignes are nothing in themselves , for any of them , in another time and place , might belong to both sexes , the other sex , or neither . In other words , a skirt does not make the social entity , woman . It takes a skirt plus a social attitude to do it . But all through history , in virtually every culture and country , there has indeed been a "
59991	59994	59995	59995	man	464	” and a "
59999	60661	59995	59995	man	464	" and in most cases the differences between them have been exploited to fantastic , sometimes sickening extremes . Why ? First of all , it is easy to state , and easy to dispose of , the theory that in a primitive , primarily hunting - and - fishing society , a weaker , slower - moving sex , occasionally heavy with child and forced frequently to pause to nurse her young , is not as well fitted to hunt and fight as the fleeter - footed , untrammeled , hard - muscled male . However , it may well be that the primitive woman was not that much smaller , slower , weaker than her mate . Perhaps the theory confuses cause and effect , and perhaps , if some other force had not insisted upon such a development , accepted it , even bred for it , the nonparous females might have hunted with the best of the men , while those men who happened to be slower , smaller , weaker , kept house with the pregnant and nursing women . And this has happened - not in the majority of cases , but many times nevertheless . The difference existed - granted . But it was exploited . It was a difference which continued to exist long , long after there was any question of hunting or , for that matter , of nursing . Humanity has insisted upon it ; made it an article of faith . Again : 126 VENUS PLUS X Why ? It would seem that there is a force which widens and exploits this difference , and , isolated , it is a deplorable , even terrifying pressure . For there is in mankind a deep and desperate necessity to feel superior . In any group there are some who genuinely are superior ... but it is easy to see that within the parameters of any group , be it culture , club , nation , profession , only a few are really superior ; the mass , clearly , are not But it is the will of the mass that dictates the mores , initiated though changes may be by individuals or minorities ; the individuals or minorities , more often than not , are cut down for their trouble . And if a unit of the mass wants to feel superior , it will find a way . This terrible drive has found expression in many ways , through history - in slavery and genocide , xenophobia and snobbery , race prejudice and sex differentiation . Given a man who , among his fellows , has no real superiority , you are faced with a bedevilled madman who , if superiority is denied him , and he can not learn one or earn one , will turn on something weaker than himself and make it inferior . The obvious , logical , handiest subject for this inexcusable indignity is his woman . He could not do this to anyone he loved . If , loving , he could not have insulted this close , so - littledifferent other half of himself , he could never have done it to his fellow man . Without this force in him , he could never have warred , nor persecuted , nor in pursuit of superiority lied , cheated , murdered and stolen . It may be that the necessity to feel superior is the source of his drive , and his warring and killing have brought him to mighty places ; yet it is not unconceivable that without it he might have turned to conquering his environment and learning his own nature , rising very much higher and , in the process , earning life for himself instead of extinction . And strangely enough , man always wanted to love . Right up to the end , it was idiomatic that one "
60663	60701	60702	60702	I	0	" music , a color , mathematics , a certain food — and aside from careless idiom , there were those who in the highest sense loved things beyond anything which even a fool would call sexual . “
60719	60720	60714	60714	I	0	" “
60735	61101	60728	60728	he	73	” Sexual love is love , certainly . But it is more precise to say that it is loving , in the same way we might say that justice is loving , and mercy is loving , forbearance , forgiveVENUS PLUS X 127 ness , and , where it is not done to maximize the self , generosity . Christianity was , at the outset , a love movement , as the slightest acquaintance with the New Testament clearly documents . What was not generally known until just before the end - s0 fiercely was all knowledge of primitive Christianity suppressed was that it was a charitic religion — that is , a religion in which the congregation participated , in the hope of having a genuine religious experience , an experience later called theolepsy , or seized of God . Many of the early Christians did achieve this state , and often ; many more achieved it but seldom , and yet kept going back and back seeking it . But once having experienced it , they were profoundly changed , inwardly gratified ; it was this intense experience , and its permanent effects , which made it possible for them to endure the most frightful hardships and tortures , to die gladly , to fear nothing . Few dispassionate descriptions of their services — gatherings is a better term - survive , but the best accounts agree on a picture of people slipping away from fields , shops , even palaces , to be together in some hidden place — a mountain glade , a catacomb , anywhere where they might be uninterrupted . It is significant that rich and poor alike mingled at these gatherings : male and female . After eating togethergenuinely , a love feast - and invoking the spirit , perhaps by song , and very likely by the dance , one or another might be seized by what they called the Spirit . Perhaps he or she -and it might be either - would exhort and praise God , and perhaps the true charitic ( that is , divinely gifted ) expression would issue forth in what was called “
61106	62009	60728	60728	he	73	” but these exhibitions , when genuine , were apparently not excessive nor frenetic ; there was often time for many to take their turn . And with a kiss of peace , they would separate and slip back to their places in the world until the next meeting . The primitive Christians did not invent charitic religion , by any means ; nor did it cease with them . It recurs again and again throughout recorded history , and it takes many forms . Frequently they are orgiastic , Dionysic , like the worship of the Great Mother of the Gods , Cybele , which exerted an immense influence in Rome , Greece and the Orient a thousand years before Christ . Or chastity - based movements like the Cathars of the Middle ages , the Adamites , the Brethen of the Free Spirit , the Waldenses ( who tried to bring a form of apostolic Christianity into the framework of the Roman church ) and many , many others appear all through 128 VENUS PLUS X history . They have in common one element — the subjective , participant , ecstatic experience and almost invariably the equality of women , and they are all love religions . Without exception they were savagely persecuted . It seems that there is a commanding element in the human makeup which regards loving as anathema , and will not suffer it to live . Why ? An objective examination of basic motivations ( and Charlie ! I know you ca n't be objective ! but bear with this ! ) reveals the simple and terrible reason . There are two direct channels into the unconscious mind . Sex is one , religion is the other ; and in pre - Christian times , it was usual to express them together . The Judeo - Christian system put a stop to it , for a very understandable reason . A charitic religion interposes nothing between the worshipper and his Divinity . A suppliant , suffused with worship , speaking in tongues , his whole body in the throes of ecstatic dance , is not splitting doctrinal hairs nor begging intercession from temporal or literary authorities . As to his conduct between times , his guide is simple . He will seek to do that which will make it possible to repeat the experience . If he does what for him is right in this endeavor , he will repeat it ; if he is not able to repeat it , that alone is his total and complete punishment . He is guiltless . The only conceivable way to use the immense power of innate religiosity — the need to worship - for the acquisition of human power , is to place between worshipper and Divinity a guilt mechanism . The only way to achieve that is to organize and systematize worship , and the obvious way to bring this about is to monitor that other great striving of life - sex . Homo sapiens is unique among species , extant and extinct , in having devised systems for the suppression of sex . There are only three ways of dealing with sex . It may be gratified ; it may be repressed ; or it may be sublimated . The latter is , through history , often an ideal and frequently a success , but it is always an instability . Simple , day - by - day gratification , as in what is called the Golden Age of Greece , where they instituted three classes of women : wives , hetaerae and prostitutes , and at the same time idealized homosexuality , may be barbaric and immoral by many standards , but produces a surprising degree of sanity . A careful look , on the other hand , at the Middle ages , makes the mind reel ; it is VENUS PLUS X 129 like opening a window on a vast insane asylum , as broad as the world and as long as a thousand years ; here is the product of repression . Here are the scourging manias , when people by the thousands flogged themselves and each other from town to town , seeking penance from excesses of guilt ; here is the mystic Suso , in the fourteenth century , who had made for him an undergarment for his loins , bearing a hundred and fifty brass nails filed sharp ; and lest he try to ease himself in his sleep , a leather harness to hold his wrists firmly against his neck ; and further , lest he try to relieve himself of the lice and fleas which plagued him , he put on leather gloves studded with sharp nails which would tear his flesh wherever he touched it ; and touch it it did , and when the wounds healed he tore them open again . He lay upon a discarded wooden door with a nail - studded cross against his back , and in forty years he never took a bath . Here are saints licking out lepers ' sores ; here is the Inquisition . All this in the name of love . How could such a thing so change ? The examination of one sequence clearly shows how . Take the suppression of the Agape , the “
62013	62671	60728	60728	he	73	” which seems to have been a universal and necessary appurtenance of primitive Christianity . It can be unearthed by records of edicts against this and that practice , and it is significant that the elimination of a rite so important to worship seems to have taken between three and four hundred years to accomplish , and was done by a gradualism of astonishing skill and efficiency . First of all , the Eucharistic , the symbolic ritual of the body and blood of Christ , was introduced into the Agape . Next , we find the Agape better organized ; there is now a bishop , without whom the Agape may not be held , for he must bless the food . A little later the bishop is traditionally kept standing through the meal , which of course keeps him separate , and above the others . After that , the kiss of peace is altered ; instead of kissing one another , all the participants kiss the officiating priest , and later , they all kiss a piece of wood which is handed around and passed to the priest . And then , of course , the kiss is done away with altogether . In the year 363 , the Council of Laodicaea is able to establish the Eucharist as a major ritual by itself , by forbidding the Agape within a church , thus separating them . For many years the Agape was held outside the church door , but by 692 ( the Trullan Council ) it was possible to forbid it altogether , under the penalty of excommunication . 130 VENUS PLUS X The Renaissance cured many of the forms of insanity , but not the insanity itself . When temporal and ecclesiastical authorities still maintained control over basically sexual matters -morals , and marriage , for example ( although it was very late in the game when the Church actually performed marriage ; marriages in England at the time of Shakespeare were by private contract valid , and by Church blessing licit ) guilt was still rife , guilt was still the filter between a man and his God . Love was still equated with passion and passion with sin , so that at one point it was held to be sinful for a man to love his wife with passion . Pleasure , the outer edge of ecstasy , was in the dour days of Protestantism , considered sinful in itself , wherever gained ; Rome held specifically that any or all sexual pleasure was sinful . And for all this capped volcano produced in terms of bridges and houses , factories and bombs , it gouted from its riven sides a frightful harvest of neurosis . And even where a nation officially discarded the church , the same repressive techniques remained , the same preoccupation with doctrine , filtered through the same mesh of guilt . So sex and religion , the real meaning of human existence , ceased to be meaning and became means ; the unbridgeable hostility between the final combatants was the proof of the identity of their aim — the total domination , for the ultimate satisfaction of the will to superiority , of all human minds . * herb Raile goes in to say goodnight to the kids .

We come from a nameless mountain and as a species we are unique ; as all species , we are transient . Our transience is our central devotion . Transience is passage , is dynamism , is movement , is change , is evolution , is mutation , is life . The special circumstance of our birth include the blessed fact that in the germ - plasm is no indoctrination . Had homo sap . had the sense ( it had the power ) it could have shut off all its poisons , vanquished all its dangers , by raising one clean new generation . Had homo sap . had the desire ( it had both sense and power enough ) to establish a charitic religion and a culture to harmonize with it , it would in time have had its clean generations . Homo sap . claimed to be searching for a formula to end its woes . Here is the formula : a charitic religion and a culture to go with it . The Apostles of Jesus found it . Before them the Greeks found it ; before them , the Minoans . Since then the Cathars found it , the Quakers , the Angel Dancers . Throughout the Orient and in Africa it has been found repeatedly ... and each time it has failed to move any but those it touched directly . Men — or at least , the men who moved men - always found that the charitic is intolerant of doctrine , neither wanting it nor needing it . But without doctrine - presbyter , interpreter , officiator — the men who move men are powerless — that is to say , not superior . There is nothing to gain in charitism . Except , of course , the knowledge of the soul ; and everlasting life . Father - dominated people who form father - dominated cul- 132 VENUS PLUS X tures have father - religions : a male deity , an authoritative scripture , a strong central government , an intolerance for inquiry and research , a repressive sexual attitude , a deep conservatism ( for one does not change what Father built ) , a rigid demarcation , in dress and conduct , between the sexes , and a profound horror of homosexuality . Mother - dominated people who form mother - dominated cultures have mother - religions : a female deity served by priestesses , a liberal government - one which feeds the masses and succors the helpless — a great tolerance for experimental thought , a permissive attitude toward sex , a hazy boundary between the insignes of the sexes , and a dread of incest . The father - dominated culture seeks always to impose itself upon others . The other does not . So it is the first , the patrist culture which tends to establish itself in the main stream , the matrist which rises within it , occasionally revolts , more often is killed . They are not stages of evolution , but phases marking swings of the pendulum . The patrists poison themselves . The matrists tend to decay , which is merely another kind of poison . Occasionally one will meet a person who has been equally influenced by his mother and his father , and emulates the best of both . Usually , however , people fall into one category or the other ; this is a slippery fence on which to walk . ... Except for the Ledom . We are liberal in art and in technological research , in expression of all kinds . We are immovably conservative in certain areas : our conviction , each of us , never to lose the skills of the hand and of the land . We are raising children who will emulate neither mother - images nor father - images , but parents ; and our deity is the Child . We renounce and forego all products of the past but ourselves , though we know there is much there that is beautiful ; that is the price we pay for quarantine and health ; that is the wall we put between ourselves and the dead hand . This is the only taboo , restriction - and the only demand we have from those who bore us . For , like homo sap . , we were born of earth and of the creatures of earth ; we were born of a race of half - beasts , half - savages ; homo sap . birthed us . Like homo sap . we are denied the names of those from whom we sprung , though , like men , we have much evidence of the probabilities . Our human parents built us a nest , and cared for us until we were fledged , but would not let us know them , because , unlike most men , they knew themselves and therefore would VENUS PLUS X : 133 not be worshipped . And no one but themselves , they and the mothers , knew of us , that we were here , that we were something new on the face of earth . They would not betray us to homo sap . , for we were different , and like all pack , herd , hive animals , homo sap . believes in the darkest part of the heart that whatever is different is by definition dangerous , and should be exterminated . Especially if it is similar in any important way ( oh how horrible the gorilla , how contemptible the baboon ) and most especially if in some way it might be superior , possessing techniques and devices surpassing their own ( remember the Sputnik Reaction , Charlie ? ) but with absolute and deadly certainty if their sex activities fall outside certain arbitrary limits ; for this is the key to all unreason , from outrage to envy .

They developed the first cerebrostyle , for example , and did most of the groundwork on the A - field , though I do n't think the first field was actually generated until we were on our own . Whether they worked on us for us until they died , or brought the work to a certain point and then sealed us off , and went back to wherever they came from , I could n't say .

The overall idea was to see what would happen if one of us was drenched with it ; if it was as poisonous as some people feared . And by some people , I mean some of the people who worked with us in the First Cave . They believed pretty strongly that we should cut all ties with homo sap . , who seemed to have fumbled the ball pretty badly , and try not to emulate him in any way , even unconsciously . This would cost us his art , his literature , and a great deal of what was good in his evaluations ; but at the same time they did not want us denied his pure sciences you mentioned astronomy yourself — and some of the developmental data .

But instead of fighting about which brand to stock , let 's load the shelves with all the brands , you know , top quality goods from all over .

There are more similar ways of loving your God than different ways of loving your God , and it 's high time and past time we moved along with the main currents of the American system and let our churches service us with self - service of the best kind , with plenty of parking space and a decent playground for the kiddies . ”

69578	69740	69569	69569	you	67	" Charlie Johns peered through the dim silver light at the cloaked figure , the mobile , sensitive face . He thought about the doggedness , the pain , the care ; the aching loneliness between two of these loving people forced to be so often apart , and all for the love they bore for their child . And he thought of the child - here a hermit - person , buried like a mole ; in Ledom a freak or a laboratory animal ; and back in his time -what ? Without knowing the language , the customs ... it could be worse than anything Mielwis could do . He almost shook his head , but he could n't , with the tearing anxiety showing on Philos face . Besides - Seace would n't allow it ; Mielwis would n't allow it . ( But remember — remember ? He knew the settings for the machine , remember ? ) "
69761	69762	69763	69763	I	0	” "
69770	69771	69772	69772	You	0	" “
69781	69820	69776	69776	I	0	” What Philos said was nothing special . The way he said it was one of the richest rewards Charlie Johns had ever known . VENUS PLUS X 145 With his dark eyes shining , Philos merely whispered , “
69829	69919	69827	69827	Soutin	198	” Philos wrapped up snugly in the thick cloak , signalling Charlie to do the same , and then placed his hands flat on the far wall , one above the other . His fingers sank into hidden purchases , and he pulled outward . A section of the smooth rock , tall as a man , rotated into the chamber . It was hollow , and shaped in cross - section like a wedge of pie . From its triangular dark interior came a gout of frosty air . “
69925	69929	69827	69827	Soutin	198	” said Philos . “
69969	69995	69947	69947	I	0	” It was Charlie 's first recognition that the warm , fresh air all over Ledom was not only conditioned , but pressurized as well . "
70001	70002	69947	69947	I	0	" "
70025	70246	70247	70247	Laura	68	” He stepped into the wedge - shaped chamber and pressed against the inner wall . It rotated him out of sight , then swung back inside , empty . Charlie stepped in and pushed . Before him , the door - edge swung against solid rock ; behind , it clipped at his heels as he pushed . And then he was standing on a hillside , under stars ; he gasped from the thin sharp cold , but perhaps the gasp was more for the stars . In the starlight , which was quite bright enough , they sprinted down the slope , dropped panting into a deep cleft in the rock , and in it , Philos found a door . He pushed it inward ; warm wind blew on them . They stepped inside , and the wind blew the door shut . They went forward again , and opened a second door , and there , running toward them down a long low room , with a real wood fire cracking on a real stone hearth ; running toward them gladly came Froure , limping but running , and running freely and gladly , Soutin . Charlie Johns murmured a single word and pitched forward in a dead faint ; and the word he said was “

70306	70319	70296	70296	he	1232	" So do n't look around . What are you looking at ? ”
70320	70328	70361	70363	Vesti la Giubba	199	" The radio , listen to that . "
70404	70410	70361	70363	Vesti la Giubba	199	“ Who 's that singing ? ”
70411	70417	70419	70419	Jeanette	113	" I do n't know , "
70427	70447	70419	70419	Jeanette	113	“ I ca n't be bothered with all this Somebody Brothers and Miltown Trios . They all sound alike . ”
70448	70458	70459	70459	She	113	" Yeah , but who , who 's that ? ”
70470	70488	70489	70489	she	113	“ It 's that wall - eyed one night before last on television with the crooked teeth , ”
70492	70495	70496	70496	he	76	" No ! ”
70500	70523	70496	70496	he	76	“ That was that backstreet Fauntleroy they call Debsie . Namely a boy type . This is a woman , girl type . "
70524	70530	70531	70531	She	113	" You do n't say . ”
70566	70574	70496	70496	he	76	“ You know , you 're right . ”
70576	70588	70496	70496	he	76	" I know I 'm right , and it scares you . ”
70598	70683	70589	70589	Herb	76	“ I 'm reading in here where Al Capp , you know , the cartoon Al Capp , says about magazine illustrating , at long last you can tell again in a magazine illustration which is the man and which is the woman . The prettiest one is the man . So just while I 'm reading that along comes the radio and there 's a girl singer with that special growl that makes her sound like a boy singer sounding like a girl . ”
70684	70690	70496	70496	he	76	" And that scares you ? ”
70691	70698	70699	70699	he	76	“ Well things could get confusing , ”
70703	70735	70699	70699	he	76	“ Goes on like this much longer , there 's going to be a mutation , that like breeds true and you do n't know is a boy or a girl . ”
70736	70747	70496	70496	he	76	" Silly . You do n't make mutations that way . ”
70748	70777	70496	70496	he	76	“ I know it . All I mean is , things go on this way , when the double - sex type mutation arrives , nobody'll notice it . ”
70778	70791	70699	70699	he	76	“ Oh , you 're making too much of it , Herb . ”
70792	70916	70496	70496	he	76	" Sure . But all the same and seriously , do n't you have the feeling sometimes that there 's some great force at work trying to make women into men and verse vicey ? Not only this singer bit . Look at Soviet Russia . Never on earth has a great VENUS PLUS X 147 social experiment turned so many women into so huge a herd of pit ponies . Look at Red China , where at last the little China dolls have been liberated out of the slavery of the honky - tonks and get to wear overalls and shovel coal fourteen hours a day alongside their brothers . It 's just the other side of that record we just heard . ”
70925	70929	70930	70930	she	113	“ Oh no , "
70933	70941	70930	70930	she	113	" on the other side is Stardust . "
70950	70959	70946	70946	LAURA	68	" Charlie looked up at the beamed ceiling . “
70964	70969	70960	70960	I	0	" he said faintly . “
70983	70984	70979	70979	I	0	” "
70990	71035	70988	70988	Laura	68	” Charlie sat up , Philos assisting . He looked at the speaker , a brown - haired , grey - eyed Ledom with strong but fine - drawn features , and those rare , firm , sculptured lips which yet can smile readily . “
71043	71055	71036	71036	Laura	68	” he said , simply as a Ledom might say it . “
71061	71170	71056	71056	You	1233	" And then he looked again , looked again at the other . Shy , yet standing beside , not behind the pillar which held the beam which held the rock ceiling . Cloaked , high - collared in the Ledom manner , with biostatic material drawn like his own , snug over the breast . But then cut down and back , leaving the lower body bare but for the sporran - like silk . A face ... a nice face , neither boyish nor too beautiful ; and oh , it was not Laura ; it 's just that she had Laura 's hair . She . “
71173	71177	71178	71178	Y	1234	” said Philos . “
71187	71192	71182	71182	you	1234	” cried Charlie stupidly . “
71204	71248	71264	71264	he	1235	” And it came to Charlie , yes of course — what else ! For Philos had told his story in the Ledom tongue , and he had always used the Ledom pronoun which is not masculine nor feminine but which also is not "
71250	71263	71264	71264	he	1235	" ; it was he , Charlie himself , who had translated it "
71266	71273	71264	71264	he	1235	” He said to the girl , “
71282	71288	71274	71274	You	1234	” She said , shyly , “
71295	71622	71264	71264	he	1235	” They would n't let him sleep — they could n't ; they had not 148 VENUS PLUS X the time but they rested and fed him ; Philos and Froure toured the house , half underground , half on the rim of a high mesa , inaccessible to any wingless thing , with broad acres of woodland behind , and meadowland where , they told him , Soutin had shot deer with a bow and arrow . Philos and Froure toured the house openly , they wept , they were prepared never to see it again . It was as late as this that Charlie found himself wondering what would become of them after he had taken Soutin away . What was the thing they were doing - treason ? What was the penalty for treason ? He could not ask . The language had no words for concepts like punishment . They left the house , climbed the hill , entered the airlock . Inside , they buried the block of light . Through the tunnel into the chimney - top , and there they buried the other block . They discarded their cloaks there and hid them , and came out into the green land , under the steely sky of Ledom . Slowly they walked toward the Ones , two by two like lovers , for Philos and Froure were lovers and Charlie and Soutin must walk so , for she was terrified . Nearing the Medical One , Froure dropped back and walked with Soutin and Charlie , while Philos walked ahead . Some few might remember Froure , but not seeing him alone . But if Philos , the solitary one , were seen walking like a loverAnd all the way , holding Soutin , whispering warnings and encouragements and sometimes direct orders , all the way , the thoughts curled and burned in the back of Charlie 's mind . "
71627	71949	71950	71950	Philos	101	” he said to Soutin sternly as they approached the subway ; he wished he had had someone to say that to him when he first saw it . Stepping into the dark entrance , he turned and caught her tight in his arms , forced her face into the cup of his shoulder . She was lithe as a lioness but as they dropped , rigid with terror . Scream ! Whyshe could n't breathe ! And on the subway she simply held him ; bruised him with her hard slim fingers , as she stood with eyes and lips sealed . But at the other end , when the invisible lift whisked her up , and she had her first experience of the motion that had so thoroughly de - stomached him - she laughed ! ... And he was glad of her , parting him now and now again from the thoughts -of love one another -of man with grafted uterus coupling with man with grafted uterus - of the knowing pride of children , worshipped VENUS PLUS X 149 of the hand of Grocid , and of Nasive , in burnished wood of the knives and needles stitching a manmade and inhuman newness into the bodies of babes — and oh the distance between , or the fusion of , deity and a dirty joke . They flung up the side of the tilting structure , Charlie smothering Soutin 's wild laughter in his shoulder , and walked into the bright shuttered silence of Seace 's laboratory . He wo n't be there , Charlie told himself urgently . But he was there . He turned from some equipment at the end of the room and strode toward them , unsmiling . Charlie sidled , drawing Soutin with him , making it necessary for Seace to pass him in order to speak to Philos . Seace said , “
71961	71973	71974	71974	Seace	62	” Philos , pale , opened his mouth to speak , when "
71976	71994	71974	71974	Seace	62	" cried Froure sharply . Seace had not seen Froure , or had not looked at the long "
71996	72090	72105	72105	Froure	174	" Ledom . He turned to brush away the interruption , and then his gaze snapped , clamped , clung to Froure 's finedrawn features . Froure smiled and touched his hands together , and the mirror - field sprang out ; it was fiendish , it was exquisite in timing , for the scientist , given one clear glimpse of that unmistakable face , impossibly here and living , saw it replaced with his own image . At the very moment he was doubting his eyes , his eyes were denied him . "
72095	72100	72101	72101	Froure	174	" he said hoarsely . “
72107	72152	72153	72153	Seace	62	” He came breathing up to the intangible plane of the mirror ; Philos slipped beside Froure and took the ring ; Froure slipped aside and Philos played Seace up the room like a hypnotized bird , then snapped it off and stood smiling . “
72155	72290	72153	72153	Seace	62	" called Froure from behind him . ... And all the while Charlie Johns was working , working at the control dials of the time machine . He set them , one , two , three , four , thumbed the toggle , turned and flung Soutin through the open door of the machine , dove after her , hooking the door to in midair as he dove . The last thing he saw as the door swung was Seace , aware at last , flinging Froure roughly aside , leaping for the controls . Charlie and Soutin fell together in a tangle . For a moment they stayed just as they were , and then Charlie got to his feet , knelt by the trembling girl , and put his arms around her . “
72299	72303	72291	72291	I	0	” she whispered . "
72312	72341	72291	72291	I	0	” he soothed . He stroked her 150 VENUS PLUS X we 're goinger , grow.courage othe hair . Suddenly -- perhaps it was reaction — he laughed . “
72346	72367	72368	72368	I	0	” She did : at him , at herself , and turned frightened attentive eyes to him . He said , “
72393	72407	72391	72391	you	0	" She pulled at her high - collared , swept - back garment . “
72420	72427	72416	72416	I	0	" She moved the silk of her "
72430	72431	72416	72416	I	0	” “
72434	72448	72416	72416	I	0	” she said , her voice cracking with the desperate courage of confessional , “
72473	72479	72462	72462	you	0	” He stopped laughing instantly . "
72485	72491	72480	72480	They	1239	" he assured her soberly . "
72497	72501	72492	72492	I	0	" she said . “
72510	72579	72492	72492	I	0	" he told her . Nor I , he thought . Philos would n't have sent her back to the time when humanity lit the fuse . Or ... would he ? Would he think it worth while to give her a year among her own kind , a month , even if she must die with them ? He wished he could ask Philos . She said , “
72586	72598	72599	72599	I	0	” He glanced at the hairline crack which was the door . “
72617	72621	72614	72614	I	0	” he said , "
72632	72638	72614	72614	I	0	” he was going to say "
72640	72643	72614	72614	I	0	" and then "
72645	72648	72614	72614	I	0	” and then "
72656	72670	72651	72651	they	1240	" I guess if the door is unlocked , we 'll have arrived . "
72671	72679	72614	72614	I	0	“ Are you going to try it ? ”
72680	72683	72684	72684	he	0	“ Sure , "
72699	72705	72706	72706	she	1241	" Do n't be frightened , ”
72735	72743	72732	72732	Davy	80	” sings Karen to her own tune . “
72746	72747	72732	72732	Davy	80	” “
72758	72759	72755	72756	someone else	1549	” “
72771	72772	72765	72765	God	73	” “
72785	72799	72800	72800	I	0	” VENUS PLUS X 151 Karen says through the translucent margins of slumber , "
72814	72860	72800	72800	I	0	" GHARLIE JOHNS OPENED THE door into a blaze of light , a blaze of silver light , a silver blaze of overcast , a stretch of silver from here clear to the Medical One , point - down and tipped and filling the view . “
72865	72882	72861	72861	You	67	" said a voice . Mielwis . Behind Charlie , à stricken sound . Not turning , “
72888	72977	72861	72861	You	67	” he rapped . Instantly Soutin pushed past him , ran out of the machine , by the controls , by Mielwis , by Grocid , by Nasive , by Seace , all of whom stared at her while she flung herself down beside Philos and Froure , who lay side by side on the floor , their hands flat and neat on their abdomens , their feet too limp . For a moment nothing was heard but Soutin 's hard inhalations ; the sighs between were silent . "
72984	72997	72979	72979	you	67	” Charlie said at last , in a voice full of hate , “
73005	73024	72998	72998	You	67	" There was no comment , unless Nasive 's dropped gaze was a comment . Mielwis said softly , “
73027	73038	72998	72998	You	67	" Charlie knew he was referring to his earlier remark . "
73067	73068	73061	73061	I	0	" “

73115	73142	73143	73143	You	67	" What can I lose now ? he thought forlornly , but there was no softening in him . He slitted his eyes and said carefully , “
73162	73178	73143	73143	You	67	” A sort of rustle went through them — movement , not sound . Finally , “
73201	73202	73199	73199	you	67	” “

73257	73271	73238	73238	we	1248	" Charlie heaved a deep breath , and almost spit as he said , “
73307	73308	73310	73310	you	67	" “
73313	73318	73310	73310	you	67	” said Mielwis courteously , "

74247	74258	74260	74260	Nasive	102	" It 's . . . not a happy thing , "
74262	74308	74309	74309	He	102	“ When I took the position that we should share what we have with homo sap . , it was a . . . sort of unreal argument . There was n't anything real involved , somehow ; just words , just names of things . "
74312	74336	74309	74309	He	102	“ I liked him . He seemed toto understand things , like our statue , The Maker , yes , and the feast ... "
74337	74343	74345	74345	Seace	62	“ He understood all right , ”
74352	74385	74345	74345	Seace	62	“ I 'd like to have seen how much he understood if we 'd told him the truth about ourselves before he saw the statue and the feast , instead of afterward . "
74386	74393	74394	74394	Mielwis	1273	“ Who was he , Mielwis ? ”
74407	74528	74529	74529	Seace	62	“ I might as well tell you . He was in a homo sap . flying machine that crashed in the mountains near here . It came apart in the air . Most of it burned and fell on the other side , far away . But that one part landed right on our ' sky ' and perched there . Charlie Johns was inside , very badly hurt , and another homo sap . who was already dead . Now , you know the ' sky ' looks just like mountains from above , but all the same it would n't be too good an idea to have search parties climbing around on it . 154 VENUS PLUS X 155 "

74915	74934	74935	74935	Grocid	103	" But the child Soutin gives us a new opportunity . Can you imagine what it might be ? ”
74942	74950	74937	74937	Nasive	102	“ We could build them a house ? ”
74956	74964	74965	74965	he	1288	" Not in the Children 's One , "
74969	75119	74965	74965	he	1288	“ They 're too ... different . Any amount of care , of love , even , could n't make up for it . It would be asking too much of them , and perhaps too much of us . Never forget who we are , Grocid — what we are , what we 're for . Humanity has never attained its optimum ability to reason , its maximum objectivity , until now , because it has always plagued itself with its dichotomies . In us , the very concept 156 VENUS PLUS X of any but individual differences has been eliminated . And Quesbu and Soutin are not different in an individual sense ; they are a different kind . We Ledcm could probably cope with it better than they , but we are still new , young , unpracticed ; we are only in our fourth generation ... "
75121	75124	75126	75126	Nasive	102	" Really ? ”
75128	75145	75126	75126	Nasive	102	" I thought ... I mean , I did n't think . I did n't know . "
75146	75201	74965	74965	he	1288	" Few of us know ; few of us care , because it does n't matter . We are conditioned to look ahead , not back . But because it bears on our decision of what to do with Quesbu and Soutin , I 'll tell you briefly how the iedom came to be . "
75214	75353	75354	75354	He	1290	" There was a homo sap . , a very great one ; whether he was known as such among his kind , I do not know . It seems probable that he was . I think he was a physiologist or a surgeon ; he must have been both , and a great deal more . He was sickened by mankind , not so much for the evils it committed , but because of the good in itself it was destroying . It came to him that humankind , having for some thousands of years enslaved itself , was inescapably about to destroy itself , unless a society could be established which would be above all the partisanship which had divided it , and unless this society could be imbued with a loyalty to nothing but humanity . "
75414	75452	75453	75453	Nasive	102	“ He and his friends made us , designed our way of life ; gave us our religion and the cerebrostyle and the rudiments of the A - field , and helped the first generation to maturity . ”
75457	75467	75453	75453	Nasive	102	“ Then some of us must have known them ! ”
75471	75525	75453	75453	Nasive	102	“ I suppose so . But what did they know ? They dressed , acted , spoke like Ledom ; one by one they died or disappeared . As an infant , a child , you accept what you see around you . We four are teachers - right ? so were they . “
75562	75616	75550	75550	Themselves	1295	" We are not really a species . We are a biological ' construct . ' In a cold blooded way we might be called a kind of machine with a function . The function is to keep humanity alive while it is murdered , and after it is well deadVENUS PLUS X 157 “
75622	75676	75677	75677	We	1296	" And that is the one aspect of Ledom which we never told Charlie Johns , because he would never believe it . No homo sap . would or could . Virtually never in human history has a group in power had the wisdom to abdicate , to relinquish , except under pressure . "
75819	75889	75806	75806	We	1296	" The pure accident of Charlie Johns ' arrival here gave us an opportunity to find out how homo sap . would react to the idea of the Ledom . You saw what happened . But the factor of Soutin , now : that presents us with a new opportunity , and our very first to see if homo sap . can be made ready for its own maturity . ”

75904	75938	75806	75806	We	1296	" Not a new homo sap . The old one , with a chance to live without hate . To live , like all young things , with a hand to guide them . ”
75947	75951	75941	75941	Nasive	102	“ Our specialty . "
75961	76027	75958	75958	his	1309	“ Philos ' , I think , and Froure 's . Let them be together they 've earned it . Let them live at the edge of Ledom - they're used to it . And let the young humans know only them , and remember us ; and then let their children and their children 's children remember them and make of us a myth ... “
76067	76118	76066	76066	...	1312	“ And one day , some other way , we will start humanity again , or perhaps meet humanity again ... but somehow , some day ( when we know ourselves well ) we can be sure , and then Ledom will cease , and humanity will begin at last . ”

I just read some figures wherein a large group of my fellow - citizens were asked if they thought all men were equal , and 61 % said Yes . The same people were then asked if Negroes were equal to whites and with the very next breath 4 % said Yes — and this without the sound of a shifting gear . To illustrate further : I once wrote a fairly vivid story about a man being unfaithful to his wife and no one made any scandalous remarks about me . I then wrote a specific kind of narrative about a woman being unfaithful to her husband and nobody had anything scandalous to say about my wife . But I wrote an empathetic sort of tale about some homosexuals and my mailbox filled up with cards drenched with scent and letters written in purple ink with green capitals . As good Philos says herein : you can not be 160 VENUS PLUS X objective about sex , especially when it 's outside certain parameters . Hence this disclaimer , friend : keep your troubles to yourself . I wear no silken sporran . It was my aim in writing Venus Plus X a ) to write a decent book b ) about sex . It is impossible to attempt such a thing without touching upon religion , which is impossible to do without touching rather heavily upon some of your toes . If this hurts , I am sorry about the pain . My own toes stand firmly upon two planks in the Bill of Rights , and if you have a book which refutes me , I promise that I shall read it with full attention and that I will not burn it . Finally , I 'd like your help in stacking these books spread all over my desk , partly because some of them are heavy and partly because it really might interest you to know whereout some of the Venus Plus X material was dredged . ( Almost . ) needless to say , I make no claim to having transferred the contents of any of these books in toto into my manuscript . But they are , one and all , provocative tomes , and I list them for provocation 's sweet sake ; and where due and acceptable , to extend my thanks to the authors . Holy Bible : Oxford Concordance .
