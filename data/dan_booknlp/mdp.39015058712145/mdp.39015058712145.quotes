Far away , in the dripping woods , something bright and fiery flickered among the trees . It was going to be a dark and stormy night . GOOD OMENS A Narrative of Certain Events occurring in the last eleven years of human history , in strict accordance as shall be shewn with : The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter Compiled and edited , with Footnotes of an Educational Nature and Precepts for the Wise , by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett .

AND : Dog ( Satanical hellhound and cat - worrier ) Eleven years ago time urrent theories on the creation of the Universe state that , if it was created at all and did n't just start , as it were , unofficially , it came into being between ten and twenty thousand million years ago . By the same token the earth itself is generally supposed to be about four and a half thousand million years old . These dates are incorrect . Medieval Jewish scholars put the date of the Creation at 3760 B.C. Greek Orthodox theologians put Creation as far back as 5508 B.C. These suggestions are also incorrect . Archbishop James Usher ( 1580 - 1656 ) published Annales Veteris et Novi Testamenti in 1654 , which suggested that the Heaven and the Earth were created in 4004 B.C. One of his aides took the calculation further , and was able to announce triumphantly that the Earth was created on Sunday the 21st of October , 4004 B.C. , at exactly 9:00 A.M. , because God liked to get work done early in the morning while he was feeling fresh . This too was incorrect . By almost a quarter of an hour . The whole business with the fossilized dinosaur skeletons was a joke the paleontologists have n't seen yet . This proves two things : Firstly , that God moves in extremely mysterious , not to say , circuitous ways . God does not play dice with the universe ; He plays an ineffable game of His own devising , which might be compared , from the perspective of any of the other players , * to being involved in an obscure and complex * ie . , everybody . NEIL GAIMAN AND TERRY PRATCHETT version of poker in a pitch - dark room , with blank cards , for infinite stakes , with a Dealer who wo n't tell you the rules , and who smiles all the time . Secondly , the Earth 's a Libra . The astrological prediction for Libra in the "
1854	2133	1851	1851	Your	914	" column of the Tadfield Advertiser , on the day this history begins , read as follows : LIBRA . 24 September-23 October . You may be feeling run down and always in the same old daily round . Home and family matters are highlighted and are hanging fire . Avoid unnecessary risks . A friend is important to you . Shelve major decisions until the way ahead seems clear . You may be vulnerable to a stomach upset today , so avoid salads . Help could come from an unexpected quarter . This was perfectly correct on every count except for the bit about the salads . It was n't a dark and stormy night . It should have been , but that 's the weather for you . For every mad scientist who 's had a convenient thunderstorm just on the night his Great Work is finished and lying on the slab , there have been dozens who 've sat around aimlessly under the peaceful stars while Igor clocks up the overtime . But do n't let the fog ( with rain later , temperatures dropping to around forty - five degrees ) give anyone a false sense of security . Just because it 's a mild night does n't mean that dark forces are n't abroad . They 're abroad all the time . They 're everywhere . They always are . That 's the whole point . Two of them lurked in the ruined graveyard . Two shadowy figures , one hunched and squat , the other lean and menacing , both of them Olympic - grade lurkers . If Bruce Springsteen had ever recorded "
2138	2206	1851	1851	Your	914	” these two would have been on the album cover . They had been lurking in the fog for an hour now , but they had been pacing themselves and could lurk for the rest of the night if necessary , with still enough sullen menace left for a final burst of lurking around dawn . Finally , after another twenty minutes , one of them said : “
2221	2356	2213	2213	He	915	” The speaker 's name was Hastur . He was a Duke of Hell . GOOD OMENS Many phenomena - wars , plagues , sudden audits - have been advanced as evidence for the hidden hand of Satan in the affairs of Man , but whenever students of demonology get together the M25 London orbital motorway is generally agreed to be among the top contenders for Exhibit A. Where they go wrong , of course , is in assuming that the wretched road is evil simply because of the incredible carnage and frustration it engenders every day . In fact , very few people on the face of the planet know that the very shape of the M25 forms the sigil odegra in the language of the Black Priesthood of Ancient Mu , and means "
2366	2976	2977	2977	I	0	” The thousands of motorists who daily fume their way around its serpentine lengths have the same effect as water on a prayer wheel , grinding out an endless fog of low - grade evil to pollute the metaphysical atmosphere for scores of miles around . It was one of Crowley 's better achievements . It had taken years to achieve , and had involved three computer hacks , two break - ins , one minor bribery and , on one wet night when all else had failed , two hours in a squelchy field shifting the marker pegs a few but occultly incredibly significant meters . When Crowley had watched the first thirty - mile - long tailback he 'd experienced the lovely warm feeling of a bad job well done . It had earned him a commendation . Crowley was currently doing 110 mph somewhere east of Slough . Nothing about him looked particularly demonic , at least by classical standards . No horns , no wings . Admittedly he was listening to a Best of Queen tape , but no conclusions should be drawn from this because all tapes left in a car for more than about a fortnight metamorphose into Best of Queen albums . No particularly demonic thoughts were going through his head . In fact , he was currently wondering vaguely who Moey and Chandon were . Crowley had dark hair and good cheekbones and he was wearing snakeskin shoes , or at least presumably he was wearing shoes , and he could do really weird things with his tongue . And , whenever he forgot himself , he had a tendency to hiss . He also did n't blink much . The car he was driving was a 1926 black Bentley , one owner from new , and that owner had been Crowley . He 'd looked after it . The reason he was late was that he was enjoying the twentieth century immensely . It was much better than the seventeenth , and a lot better than the fourteenth . One of the nice things about Time , Crowley NEIL GAIMAN AND TERRY PRATCHETT always said , was that it was steadily taking him further away from the fourteenth century , the most bloody boring hundred years on God 's , excuse his French , Earth . The twentieth century was anything but boring . In fact , a flashing blue light in his rearview mirror had been telling Crowley , for the last fifty seconds , that he was being followed by two men who would like to make it even more interesting for him . He glanced at his watch , which was designed for the kind of rich deep - sea diver who likes to know what the time is in twenty - one world capitals while he 's down there . * The Bentley thundered up the exit ramp , took the corner on two wheels , and plunged down a leafy road . The blue light followed . Crowley sighed , took one hand from the wheel , and , half turning , made a complicated gesture over his shoulder . The flashing light dimmed into the distance as the police car rolled to a halt , much to the amazement of its occupants . But it would be nothing to the amazement they 'd experience when they opened the hood and found out what the engine had turned into . In the graveyard , Hastur , the tall demon , passed a dogend back to Ligur , the shorter one and the more accomplished lurker . “

3103	3107	3095	3095	He	383	" he said . “
3130	3180	3182	3182	he	383	” Ligur pondered this . Like most demons , he had a very limited grasp of technology , and so he was just about to say something like , I bet it needs a lot of wire , when the Bentley rolled to a halt at the cemetery gate . “
3186	3190	3182	3182	he	383	” sneered Hastur , “
3198	3204	3207	3207	Satan	393	” He raised his voice . “
3209	3213	3207	3207	Satan	393	” he said . "
3218	3280	3216	3216	Satan	393	” Ligur echoed . * It was custom - made for Crowley . Getting just one chip custom - made is incredibly expensive but he could afford it . This watch gave the time in twenty world capitals and in a capital city in Another Place , where it was always one time , and that was Too Late . GOOD OMENS “
3283	3293	3216	3216	Satan	393	” said Crowley , giving them a little wave . "

3331	3336	3326	3326	we	925	" said Hastur meaningfully , “

3352	3388	3389	3389	I	0	” said Crowley , with the slightly guilty look of one who is attending church for the first time in years and has forgotten which bits you stand up for . Hastur cleared his throat . “
3395	3399	3389	3389	I	0	” he said . “
3438	3439	3440	3441	Nice one	930	" “
3443	3449	3440	3441	Nice one	930	” said Crowley , helpfully . "
3456	3460	3461	3461	I	0	” said Ligur . “
3480	3495	3496	3496	You	932	” They both looked expectantly at Crowley , who gave them a big smile . “
3501	3514	3496	3496	You	932	” he said . His smile became even wider and more conspiratorial . “
3533	3549	3515	3515	I	0	” he said . There was silence , except for the distant swishing of cars . “
3552	3556	3515	3515	I	0	” said Hastur . “
3561	3562	3515	3515	I	0	” “
3570	3574	3515	3515	I	0	” said Crowley . “
3579	3583	3586	3586	people	934	” said Ligur . “
3587	3588	3586	3586	people	934	" “
3602	3846	3586	3586	people	934	” said Hastur . Crowley pulled himself together . What could he tell them ? That twenty thousand people got bloody furious ? That you could hear the arteries clanging shut all across the city ? And that then they went back and took it out on their secretaries or traffic wardens or whatever , and they took it out on other people ? In all kinds of vindictive little ways which , and here was the good bit , they thought up themselves . For the rest of the day . The pass - along effects were incalculable . Thousands and thousands of souls all got a faint patina of tarnish , and you hardly had to lift a finger . But you could n't tell that to demons like Hastur and Ligur . Fourteenth - century minds , the lot of them . Spending years picking away at one soul . Admittedly it was craftsmanship , but you had to think differently these days . Not big , but wide . With five billion people in the world you could n't pick the buggers off one by one any more ; you had to spread your NEIL GAIMAN AND TERRY PRATCHETT effort . But demons like Ligur and Hastur would n't understand . They 'd never have thought up Welsh - language television , for example . Or valueadded tax . Or Manchester . He 'd been particularly pleased with Manchester . “
3856	3860	3586	3586	people	934	” he said . "
3870	3878	3586	3586	people	934	" Hastur reached down behind a tombstone . “
3882	3892	3586	3586	people	934	” he said . Crowley stared at the basket . "
3895	3899	3586	3586	people	934	” he said . "
3902	3903	3586	3586	people	934	" “

4107	4149	4045	4045	his	0	” he said , leaving a terrible pause between the words . Crowley fumbled vaguely in an inside pocket and produced a pen . It was sleek and matte black . It looked as though it could exceed the speed limit . “
4155	4159	4045	4045	his	0	” said Ligur . "
4166	4170	4045	4045	his	0	” Crowley muttered . "

4195	4199	4187	4187	they	937	” said Hastur . “
4211	4243	4205	4205	Crowley	383	” Crowley nodded mournfully , and drew a complex , wiggly sigil on the paper . It glowed redly in the gloom , just for a moment , and then faded . “
4253	4257	4258	4258	You	383	” he said . "
4263	4267	4258	4258	You	383	” Hastur scowled . “
4290	4291	4205	4205	Crowley	383	” "
4296	4330	4205	4205	Crowley	383	” said Crowley . He did not look , now , like the lithe figure that had sprung so lithely from the Bentley a few minutes ago . He had a hunted expression . “
4338	4339	4331	4331	Our	938	” “
4344	4348	4274	4274	Crowley	383	” said Crowley . "
4360	4361	4350	4350	you	383	" "
4366	4394	4274	4274	Crowley	383	” muttered Crowley . He picked up the basket as if it might explode . Which , in a manner of speaking , it would shortly do . “
4399	4403	4274	4274	Crowley	383	” he said . “
4431	4451	4423	4423	I	0	” he added hurriedly , aware of the things that could happen if Hastur turned in an unfavorable report . “
4459	4467	4457	4457	Keen	413	” The senior demons did not speak . “
4475	4479	4469	4469	I	0	” Crowley babbled . "
4496	4508	4469	4469	I	0	” As the Bentley skidded off into the darkness Ligur said , "

4518	4522	4523	4523	I	0	" said Hastur . "

4540	4548	4523	4523	I	0	” Ligur stared at the retreating taillights . "
4553	4557	4549	4549	You	383	” he said . "
4560	4564	4549	4549	You	383	" said Hastur . "
4567	4664	4549	4549	You	383	” said Ligur . It 'd be a funny old world , he reflected , if demons went round trusting one another . ammed it into othing music , in a headlight , Crowley , somewhere west of Amersham , hurtled through the night , snatched a tape at random and tried to wrestle it out of its brittle plastic box while staying on the road . The glare of a headlight proclaimed it to be Vivaldi 's Four Seasons . Soothing music , that 's what he needed . He rammed it into the Blaupunkt . “
4673	4786	4792	4792	lord	941	” he muttered , as the familiar strains of Queen washed over him . And suddenly , Freddie Mercury was speaking to him : BECAUSE YOU'VE EARNED IT , CROWLEY . Crowley blessed under his breath . Using electronics as a means of communication had been his idea and Below had , for once , taken it up and , as usual , got it dead wrong . He 'd hoped they could be persuaded to subscribe to Cellnet , but instead they just cut in to whatever it happened to be that he was listening to at the time and twisted it . 10 NEIL GAIMAN AND TERRY PRATCHETT Crowley gulped . “
4794	4807	4792	4792	lord	941	” he said . WE HAVE GREAT FAITH IN YOU , CROWLEY . "
4813	4820	4811	4811	lord	941	” THIS IS IMPORTANT , CROWLEY . "
4827	4836	4811	4811	lord	941	" THIS IS THE BIG ONE , CROWLEY . “
4844	4875	4842	4842	lord	941	” THAT IS WHAT WE ARE DOING , CROWLEY . AND IF IT GOES WRONG , THEN THOSE INVOLVED WILL SUFFER GREATLY . EVEN YOU , CROWLEY . ESPECIALLY YOU . “
4880	4929	4878	4878	lord	941	” HERE ARE YOUR INSTRUCTIONS , CROWLEY . And suddenly he knew . He hated that . They could just as easily have told him , they did n't suddenly have to drop chilly knowledge straight into his brain . He had to drive to a certain hospital . "
4943	6079	4938	4938	lord	941	” GOOD . I see a little silhouetto of a man scaramouche scaramouche will you do the fandango ... Crowley thumped the wheel . Everything had been going so well , he 'd had it really under his thumb these few centuries . That 's how it goes , you think you 're on top of the world , and suddenly they spring Armageddon on you . The Great War , the Last Battle . Heaven versus Hell , three rounds , one Fall , no submission . And that 'd be that . No more world . That 's what the end of the world meant . No more world . Just endless Heaven or , depending who won , endless Hell . Crowley did n't know which was worse . Well , Hell was worse , of course , by definition . But Crowley remembered what Heaven was like , and it had quite a few things in common with Hell . You could n't get a decent drink in either of them , for a start . And the boredom you got in Heaven was almost as bad as the excitement you got in Hell . But there was no getting out of it . You could n't be a demon and have free will . ... I will not let you go ( let him go ) ... Well , at least it would n't be this year . He 'd have time to do things . Unload long - term stocks , for a start . He wondered what would happen if he just stopped the car here , on this dark and damp and empty road , and took the basket and swung it round and round and let go and ... Something dreadful , that 's what . GOOD OMENS 11 He 'd been an angel once . He had n't meant to Fall . He 'd just hung around with the wrong people . The Bentley plunged on through the darkness , its fuel gauge pointing to zero . It had pointed to zero for more than sixty years now . It was n't all bad , being a demon . You did n't have to buy petrol , for one thing . The only time Crowley had bought petrol was once in 1967 , to get the free James Bond bullet - hole - in - the - windscreen transfers , which he rather fancied at the time . On the back seat the thing in the basket began to cry ; the air - raid siren wail of the newly born . High . Wordless . And old . It was quite a nice hospital , thought Mr. Young . It would have been quiet , too , if it was n't for the nuns . He quite liked nuns . Not that he was a , you know , left - footer or anything like that . No , when it came to avoiding going to church , the church he stolidly avoided going to was St. Cecil and All Angels , nononsense C. of E. , and he would n't have dreamed of avoiding going to any other . All the others had the wrong smell — floor polish for the Low , somewhat suspicious incense for the High . Deep in the leather armchair of his soul , Mr. Young knew that God got embarrassed at that sort of thing . But he liked seeing nuns around , in the same way that he liked seeing the Salvation Army . It made you feel that it was all all right , that people somewhere were keeping the world on its axis . This was his first experience of the Chattering Order of Saint Beryl , however . * Deirdre had run across them while being involved in one of her causes , possibly the one involving lots of unpleasant South Americans fighting other unpleasant South Americans and the priests egging them on * Saint Beryl Articulatus of Cracow , reputed to have been martyred in the middle of the fifth century . According to legend , Beryl was a young woman who was betrothed against her will to a pagan , Prince Casimir . On their wedding night she prayed to the Lord to intercede , vaguely expecting a miraculous beard to appear , and she had in fact already laid in a small ivory - handled razor , suitable for ladies , against this very eventuality ; instead the Lord granted Beryl the miraculous ability to chatter continually about whatever was on her mind , however inconsequential , without pause for breath or food . According to one version of the legend , Beryl was strangled by Prince Casimir three weeks after the wedding , with their marriage still unconsummated . She died a virgin and a martyr , chattering to the end . According to another version of the legend , Casimir bought himself a set of earplugs , and she died in bed , with him , at the age of sixty - two . The Chattering Order of Saint Beryl is under a vow to emulate Saint Beryl at all times , except on Tuesday afternoons , for half an hour , when the nuns are permitted to shut up , and , if they wish , to play table tennis . NEIL GAIMAN AND TERRY PRATCHETT instead of getting on with proper priestly concerns , like organizing the church cleaning rota . The point was , nuns should be quiet . They were the right shape for it , like those pointy things you got in those chambers Mr. Young was vaguely aware your hi - fi got tested in . They should n't be , well , chattering all the time . He filled his pipe with tobacco_well , they called it tobacco , it was n't what he thought of as tobacco , it was n't the tobacco you used to get -and wondered reflectively what would happen if you asked a nun where the Gents was . Probably the Pope sent you a sharp note or something . He shifted his position awkwardly , and glanced at his watch . One thing , though : At least the nuns had put their foot down about him being present at the birth . Deirdre had been all for it . She 'd been reading things again . One kid already and suddenly she 's declaring that this confinement was going to be the most joyous and sharing experience two human beings could have . That 's what came of letting her order her own newspapers . Mr. Young distrusted papers whose inner pages had names like “
6081	6083	6516	6516	They	947	" or "
6086	6393	6516	6516	They	947	” Well , he had n't got anything against joyous sharing experiences . Joyous sharing experiences were fine by him . The world probably needed more joyous sharing experiences . But he had made it abundantly clear that this was one joyous sharing experience Deirdre could have by herself . And the nuns had agreed . They saw no reason for the father to be involved in the proceedings . When you thought about it , Mr. Young mused , they probably saw no reason why the father should be involved anywhere . He finished thumbing the so - called tobacco into the pipe and glared at the little sign on the wall of the waiting room that said that , for his own comfort , he would not smoke . For his own comfort , he decided , he 'd go and stand in the porch . If there was a discreet shrubbery for his own comfort out there , so much the better . He wandered down the empty corridors and found a doorway that led out onto a rain - swept courtyard full of righteous dustbins . He shivered , and cupped his hands to light his pipe . It happened to them at a certain age , wives . Twenty - five blameless years , then suddenly they were going off and doing these robotic exercises in pink socks with the feet cut out and they started blaming you for never having had to work for a living . It was hormones , or something . A large black car skidded to a halt by the dustbins . A young man in dark glasses leaped out into the drizzle holding what looked like a carrycot and snaked toward the entrance . GOOD OMENS Mr. Young took his pipe out of his mouth . "
6401	6439	6394	6394	You	946	” he said helpfully . The man gave him the blank look of someone to whom lights are the least of his worries , and waved a hand vaguely toward the Bentley . The lights went out . “
6444	6449	6394	6394	You	946	" said Mr. Young . “
6457	6483	6394	6394	You	946	” He was mildly surprised to see that the man did not appear to be wet . And that the carrycot appeared to be occupied . “
6489	6508	6394	6394	You	946	” said the man . Mr. Young felt vaguely proud to be so instantly recognizable as a parent . “
6511	6515	6394	6394	You	946	” he said . “
6522	6527	6516	6516	They	947	” he added thankfully . “
6538	6553	6554	6554	I	0	” We , Mr. Young noted . Obviously a doctor with views about coparenting . “
6566	6571	6556	6556	we	948	” said Mr. Young . "
6578	6584	6575	6575	she	950	” said the man hurriedly . "
6591	6619	6575	6575	she	950	” said Mr. Young . He patted his pockets , and found the battered packet which , in accord with tradition , he had brought with him . "
6630	6955	6958	6958	him	951	” he said . But the man had gone . Mr. Young carefully replaced the packet and looked reflectively at his pipe . Always in a rush , these doctors . Working all the hours God sent . There 's a trick they do with one pea and three cups which is very hard to follow , and something like it , for greater stakes than a handful of loose change , is about to take place . The text will be slowed down to allow the sleight of hand to be followed . Mrs. Deirdre Young is giving birth in Delivery Room Three . She is having a golden - haired male baby we will call Baby A. The wife of the American Cultural Attaché , Mrs. Harriet Dowling , is giving birth in Delivery Room Four . She is having a golden - haired male baby we will call Baby B. Sister Mary Loquacious has been a devout Satanist since birth . She went to Sabbat School as a child and won black stars for handwriting and liver . When she was told to join the Chattering Order she went obediently , having a natural talent in that direction and , in any case , knowing that she would be among friends . She would be quite bright , if she was ever put in a 14 NEIL GAIMAN AND TERRY PRATCHETT position to find out , but long ago found that being a scatterbrain , as she 'd put it , gave you an easier journey through life . Currently she is being handed a golden - haired male baby we will call the Adversary , Destroyer of Kings , Angel of the Bottomless Pit , Great Beast that is called Dragon , Prince of This World , Father of Lies , Spawn of Satan , and Lord of Darkness . Watch carefully . Round and round they go . ... . "
6960	6970	6958	6958	him	951	” said Sister Mary , staring at the baby . “
6995	7016	7021	7021	him	951	" She turned him around as she spoke . No horns either . The Devil 's child looked ominously normal . “
7023	7027	7021	7021	him	951	” said Crowley . "
7034	7039	7029	7029	me	0	” said Sister Mary . “
7054	7081	7082	7082	Hallo	427	" She was now addressing the child directly , lost in some world of her own . Crowley waved a hand in front of her wimple . "
7089	7090	7086	7087	Sister Mary	398	” "
7122	7125	7127	7127	Crowley	416	" No , "
7130	7147	7127	7127	Crowley	416	“ And now I should get up to the delivery rooms , if I were you . ”
7148	7162	7164	7165	Sister Mary	398	" Will he remember me when he grows up , do you think ? ”
7174	7181	7183	7183	Crowley	416	" Pray that he does n't , ”
7269	7289	7266	7266	It	966	“ Sister Mary , what are you doing here ? Should n't you be on duty in Room Four ? ”
7290	7294	7252	7252	She	398	" Master Crowley said "
7295	7321	7252	7252	She	398	" Just glide along , there 's a good nun . Have you seen the husband anywhere ? He 's not in the waiting room . "
7322	7334	7266	7266	It	966	" I 've only seen Master Crowley , and he told me "
7335	7342	7344	7346	Sister Grace Voluble	429	" I 'm sure he did , ”
7349	7386	7387	7388	Sister Grace	429	“ I suppose I 'd better go and look for the wretched man . Come in and keep an eye on her , will you ? She 's a bit woozy but the baby 's fine . "
7391	7405	7387	7388	Sister Grace	429	" Why are you winking ? Is there something wrong with your eye ? ”
7408	7412	7413	7414	Sister Mary	398	" You know ! ”
7418	7424	7413	7414	Sister Mary	398	“ The babies . The exchange ”
7426	7450	7452	7453	Sister Grace	429	" Of course , of course . In good time . But we ca n't have the father wandering around , can we ? ”
7455	7477	7478	7478	She	429	“ No telling what he might see . So just wait here and mind the baby , there 's a dear . ”
7889	7895	7897	7898	Mr. Young	399	" Has it happened yet ? ”
7900	7913	7897	7898	Mr. Young	399	" I 'm the father . The husband . Whatever . Both . ”
7991	7996	7997	7997	she	398	“ Oooh , yes , ”
8000	8012	7997	7997	she	398	“ Congratulations . Your lady wife 's asleep , poor pet . ”

This one was Shakespeare 's earliest play , The Comedie of Robin Hoode , or , The Forest of Sherwoode . * * Master Bilton had paid almost six guineas for the quarto , and believed he could make nearly twice that much back on the hardcover folio alone . Then he lost it . Bilton and Scaggs ' third great publishing disaster was never entirely comprehensible to either of them . Everywhere you looked , books of * The Buggre Alle This Bible was also noteworthy for having twenty - seven verses in the third chapter of Genesis , instead of the more usual twenty - four . They followed verse 24 , which in the King James version reads : "
15359	15656	15328	15328	he	1258	" and read : 25 And the Lord spake unto the Angel that guarded the eastern gate , saying Where is the flaming sword which was given unto thee ? 26 And the Angel said , I had it here only a moment ago , I must have put it down some where , forget my own head next . 27 And the Lord did not ask him again . It appears that these verses were inserted during the proof stage . In those days it was common practice for printers to hang proof sheets to the wooden beams outside their shops , for the edification of the populace and some free proofreading , and since the whole print run was subsequently burned anyway , no one bothered to take up this matter with the nice Mr. A. Ziraphale , who ran the bookshop two doors along and was always so helpful with the translations , and whose handwriting was instantly recognizable . * * The other two are The Trapping of the Mouse , and Golde Diggers of 1589 . GOOD OMENS 31 prophecy were selling like crazy . The English edition of Nostradamus ' Centuries had just gone into its third printing , and five Nostradamuses , all claiming to be the only genuine one , were on triumphant signing tours . And Mother Shipton 's Collection of Prophecies was sprinting out of the shops . Each of the great London publishers — there were eight of them had at least one Book of Prophecy on its list . Every single one of the books was wildly inaccurate , but their air of vague and generalized omnipotence made them immensely popular . They sold in the thousands , and in the tens of thousands . "

15696	15838	15693	15694	some hagge	1263	" The manuscript arrived at their door the next morning ; the author 's sense of timing , as always , was exact . Although neither Master Bilton nor Master Scaggs realized it , the manuscript they had been sent was the sole prophetic work in all of human history to consist entirely of completely correct predictions concerning the following three hundred and forty - odd years , being a precise and accurate description of the events that would culminate in Armageddon . It was on the money in every single detail . It was published by Bilton and Scaggs in September 1655 , in good time for the Christmas trade , * * and it was the first book printed in England to be remaindered . It did n't sell . Not even the copy in the tiny Lancashire shop with “
15841	16349	15693	15694	some hagge	1263	" on a piece of cardboard next to it . The author of the book , one Agnes Nutter , was not surprised by this , but then , it would have taken an awful lot to surprise Agnes Nutter . Anyway , she had not written it for the sales , or the royalties , or even for the fame . She had written it for the single gratis copy of the book that an author was entitled to . No one knows what happened to the legions of unsold copies of her book . Certainly none remain in any museums or private collections . Even Aziraphale does not possess a copy , but would go weak at the knees at the thought of actually getting his exquisitely manicured hands on one . * Who had already had a few thoughts in that direction , and spent the last years of his life in Newgate Prison when he eventually put them into practice . * * Another master stroke of publishing genius , because Oliver Cromwell 's ' Puritan Parliament had made Christmas illegal in 1654 . NEIL GAIMAN AND TERRY PRATCHETT In fact , only one copy of Agnes Nutter 's prophecies remained in the entire world . It was on a bookshelf about forty miles away from where Crowley and Aziraphale were enjoying a rather good lunch and , metaphorically , it had just begun to tick . And now it was three o'clock . The Antichrist had been on Earth for fifteen hours , and one angel and one demon had been drinking solidly for three of them . They sat opposite one another in the back room of Aziraphale 's dingy old bookshop in Soho . Most bookshops in Soho have back rooms , and most of the back rooms are filled with rare , or at least very expensive , books . But Aziraphale 's books did n't have illustrations . They had old brown covers and crackling pages . Occasionally , if he had no alternative , he 'd sell one . And , occasionally , serious men in dark suits would come calling and suggest , very politely , that perhaps he 'd like to sell the shop itself so that it could be turned into the kind of retail outlet more suited to the area . Sometimes they 'd offer cash , in large rolls of grubby fifty - pound notes . Or , sometimes , while they were talking , other men in dark glasses would wander around the shop shaking their heads and saying how inflammable paper was , and what a fire trap he had here . And Aziraphale would nod and smile and say that he 'd think about it . And then they 'd go away . And they 'd never come back . Just because you 're an angel does n't mean you have to be a fool . The table in front of the two of them was covered with bottles . “

18055	18073	18075	18075	Aziraphale	387	" What will happen to the child if it does n't get a Satanic upbringing , though ? ”
18077	18086	18075	18075	Aziraphale	387	“ Probably nothing . It 'll never know . ”
18087	18090	18110	18110	Crowley	383	" But genetics ”
18091	18108	18110	18110	Crowley	383	" Do n't tell me from genetics . What 've they got to do with it ? ”
18112	18215	18110	18110	Crowley	383	“ Look at Satan . Created as an angel , grows up to be the Great Adversary . Hey , if you 're going to go on about genetics , you might as well say the kid will grow up to be an angel . After all , his father was really big in Heaven in the old days . Saying he 'll grow up to be a demon just because his dad became one is like saying a mouse with its tail cut off will give birth to tailless mice . No . Upbringing is everything . Take it from me . ”
18216	18222	18110	18110	Crowley	383	" And without unopposed Satanic influences ”
18223	18259	18110	18110	Crowley	383	" Well , at worst Hell will have to start all over again . And the Earth gets at least another eleven years . That 's got to be worth something , has n't it ? ”
18267	18279	18280	18280	he	387	" You 're saying the child is n't evil of itself ? ”

18308	18315	18110	18110	Crowley	383	” said Crowley . He shrugged . “

18352	18362	18341	18341	I	0	” said the angel . Crowley nodded encouragingly . ' "
18365	18382	18341	18341	I	0	” said the demon , holding out his hand . The angel shook it , cautiously . "

18413	18417	18418	18418	We	1276	” said Crowley . “
18435	18439	18440	18440	You	1281	” Aziraphale beamed . “
18451	18455	18456	18456	Godfathers	1280	” he said . "

18474	18478	18460	18460	I	0	” said Crowley , “
18486	18883	18480	18480	you	1281	” She was known as Scarlett . At that time she was selling arms , although it was beginning to lose its savor . She never stuck at one job for very long . Three , four hundred years at the outside . You did n't want to get in a rut . GOOD OMENS 37 Her hair was true auburn , neither ginger nor brown , but deep and burnished copper - color , and it fell to her waist in tresses that men would kill for , and indeed often had . Her eyes were a startling orange . She looked twenty - five , and always had . She had a dusty , brick - red truck full of assorted weaponry , and an almost unbelievable skill at getting it across any border in the world . She had been on her way to a small West African country , where a minor civil war was in progress , to make a delivery which would , with any luck , turn it into a major civil war . Unfortunately the truck had broken down , far beyond even her ability to repair it . And she was very good with machinery these days . She was in the middle of a city * at the time . The city in question was the capital of Kumbolaland , an African nation which had been at peace for the last three thousand years . For about thirty years it was SirHumphrey - Clarksonland , but since the country had absolutely no mineral wealth and the strategic importance of a banana , it was accelerated toward self - government with almost unseemly haste . Kumbolaland was poor , perhaps , and undoubtedly boring , but peaceful . Its various tribes , who got along with one another quite happily , had long since beaten their swords into ploughshares ; a fight had broken out in the city square in 1952 between a drunken ox - drover and an equally drunken ox - thief . People were still talking about it . Scarlett yawned in the heat . She fanned her head with her broadbrimmed hat , left the useless truck in the dusty street , and wandered into a bar . She bought a can of beer , drained it , then grinned at the barman . “
18891	18895	18884	18884	I	0	” she said . “
18903	18925	18927	18927	Nathan	485	” The barman grinned white and huge and expansively . He 'd been impressed by the way she drank her beer . “
18949	18955	18932	18932	Nathan	485	” Scarlett bought another beer . “
18969	18970	18991	18992	a scamp	1289	" "
18996	19001	18991	18992	a scamp	1289	” He leaned forward . “
19008	19012	19006	19006	miss	1285	” he said . “
19015	19016	19006	19006	miss	1285	” “
19037	19087	19033	19035	Not local boys	1294	” he added quickly . * Nominally a city . It was the size of an English county town , or , translated into American terms , a shopping mall . 38 NEIL GAIMAN AND TERRY PRATCHETT Scarlett raised a perfect eyebrow . Despite the heat , he shivered . "
19093	19242	19033	19035	Not local boys	1294	” Scarlett purred . Her voice sounded like something that lurks in the long grass , visible only by the twitching of its ears , until something young and tender wobbles by . She tipped her hat to him , and strolled outside . The hot African sun beat down on her ; her truck sat in the street with a cargo of guns and ammunition and land mines . It was n't going anywhere . Scarlett stared at the truck . A vulture was sitting on its roof . It had traveled three hundred miles with Scarlett so far . It was belching quietly . She looked around the street : a couple of women chatted on a street corner ; a bored market vendor sat in front of a heap of colored gourds , fanning the flies ; a few children played lazily in the dust . “
19247	19252	19033	19035	Not local boys	1294	” she said quietly . “
19261	19470	19033	19035	Not local boys	1294	” That was Wednesday . By Friday the city was a no - go area . By the following Tuesday the economy of Kumbolaland was shattered , twenty thousand people were dead ( including the barman , shot by the rebels while storming the market barricades ) , almost a hundred thousand people were injured , all of Scarlett 's assorted weapons had fulfilled the function for which they had been created , and the vulture had died of Greasy Degeneration . Scarlett was already on the last train out of the country . It was time to move on , she felt . She 'd been doing arms for too damn long . She wanted a change . Something with openings . She quite fancied herself as a newspaper journalist . A possibility . She fanned herself with her hat , and crossed her long legs in front of her . Farther down the train a fight broke out . Scarlett grinned . People were always fighting , over her , and around her ; it was rather sweet , really . Sable had black hair , a trim black beard , and he had just decided to go corporate . He did drinks with his accountant . "
19477	19482	19475	19475	Frannie	488	” he asked her . “
19495	19738	19491	19491	you	488	” * They were doing drinks in a restaurant called Top of the Sixes , on the top of 666 Fifth Avenue , New York . This was something that amused GOOD OMENS Sable ever so slightly . From the restaurant windows you could see the whole of New York ; at night , the rest of New York could see the huge red 666s that adorned all four sides of the building . Of course , it was just another street number . If you started counting , you 'd be bound to get to it eventually . But you had to smile . Sable and his accountant had just come from a small , expensive , and particularly exclusive restaurant in Greenwich Village , where the cuisine was entirely nouvelle : a string bean , a pea , and a sliver of chicken breast , aesthetically arranged on a square china plate . Sable had invented it the last time he 'd been in Paris . His accountant had polished her meat and two veg off in under fifty seconds , and had spent the rest of the meal staring at the plate , the cutlery , and from time to time at her fellow diners , in a manner that suggested that she was wondering what they 'd taste like , which was in fact the case . It had amused Sable enormously . He toyed with his Perrier . "
19749	19750	19491	19491	you	488	” “
19755	19756	19491	19491	you	488	" “
19807	19811	19815	19815	Sable	487	” Frannie nodded . “
19820	19880	19817	19817	We	1296	” . She was interrupted by a skeleton . A skeleton in a Dior dress , with tanned skin stretched almost to snapping point over the delicate bones of the skull . The skeleton had long blond hair and perfectly made - up lips : she looked like the person mothers around the world would point to , muttering , “
19895	19927	19817	19817	We	1296	” ; she looked like a famine - relief poster with style . She was New York 's top fashion model , and she was holding a book . She said , “
19967	20038	19960	19960	you	489	” She stared imploringly at him with eyes deepsunk in gloriously eyeshadowed sockets . Sable nodded graciously , and took the book from her . It was not surprising that she had recognized him , for his dark gray eyes stared out from his photo on the foil - embossed cover . Foodless Dieting : Slim Yourself Beautiful , the book was called ; The Diet Book of the Century ! “
20046	20050	20051	20051	Sherryl	491	” he asked . “
20061	20062	20063	20063	You	489	” "
20073	20095	20063	20063	You	489	” he told her , as he wrote 40 NEIL GAIMAN AND TERRY PRATCHETT swiftly and carefully on the title page . “
20112	20157	20109	20110	a fan	1302	” What he 'd written was this : Sherryl , A measure of wheat for a penny , and three measures of barley for a penny , and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine . Rev. 6:6 . Dr. Raven Sable . "
20164	20315	20109	20110	a fan	1302	” he told her . She closed the book reverently and backed away from the table , thanking Sable , he did n't know how much this meant to her , he had changed her life , truly he had . ... He had never actually earned the medical degree he claimed , since there had n't been any universities in those days , but Sable could see she was starving to death . He gave her a couple of months at the outside . Foodless . Handle your weight problem , terminally . Frannie was stabbing at her laptop computer hungrily , planning the next phase in Sable ’s transformation of the eating habits of the Western World . Sable had bought her the machine as a personal present . It was very , very expensive , very powerful , and ultra - slim . He liked slim things . “
20372	21372	21373	21373	I	0	" But Sable was no longer listening . He was remembering the exclusive little restaurant . It had occurred to him that he had never seen so many rich people so hungry . Sable grinned , the honest , open grin that goes with job satisfaction , perfect and pure . He was just killing time until the main event , but he was killing it in such exquisite ways . Time , and sometimes people . Sometimes he was called White , or Blanc , or Albus , or Chalky , or Weiss , or Snowy , or any one of a hundred other names . His skin was pale , his hair a faded blond , his eyes light gray . He was somewhere in his twenties at a casual glance , and a casual glance was all anyone ever gave him . GOOD OMENS vou thouseothing , baru to for ? He was almost entirely unmemorable . Unlike his two colleagues , he could never settle down in any one job for very long . He had had all manner of interesting jobs in lots of interesting places . ( He had worked at the Chernobyl Power Station , and at Windscale , and at Three Mile Island , always in minor jobs that were n't very important . ) He had been a minor but valued member of a number of scientific research establishments . ( He had helped to design the petrol engine , and plastics , and the ring - pull can . ) He could turn his hand to anything . Nobody really noticed him . He was unobtrusive ; his presence was cumulative . If you thought about it carefully , you could figure out he had to have been doing something , had to have been somewhere . Maybe he even spoke to you . But he was easy to forget , was Mr. White . At this time he was working as deckhand on an oil tanker , heading toward Tokyo . The captain was drunk in his cabin . The first mate was in the head . The second mate was in the galley . That was pretty much it for the crew : the ship was almost completely automated . There was n't much a person could do . However , if a person just happened to press the EMERGENCY CARGO RELEASE switch on the bridge , the automatic systems would take care of releasing huge quantities of black sludge into the sea , millions of tons of crude oil , with devastating effect on the birds , fish , vegetation , animals , and humans of the region . Of course , there were dozens of failsafe interlocks and foolproof safety backups but , what the hell , there always were . Afterwards , there was a huge amount of argument as to exactly whose fault it was . In the end it was left unresolved : the blame was apportioned equally . Neither the captain , the first mate , nor the second mate ever worked again . For some reason nobody gave much of a thought to Seaman White , who was already halfway to Indonesia on a tramp steamer piled high with rusting metal barrels of a particularly toxic weedkiller . And there was Another . He was in the square in Kumbolaland . And he was in the restaurants . And he was in the fish , and in the air , and NEIL GAIMAN AND TERRY PRATCHETT in the barrels of weedkiller . He was on the roads , and in houses , and in palaces , and in hovels . There was nowhere that he was a stranger , and there was no getting away from him . He was doing what he did best , and what he was doing was what he was . He was not waiting . He was working . Harriet Dowling returned home with her baby , which , on the advice of Sister Faith Prolix , who was more persuasive than Sister Mary , and with the telephonic agreement of her husband , she had named Warlock . The Cultural Attaché returned home a week later , and pronounced the baby the spit of his side of the family . He also had his secretary advertise in The Lady for a nanny . Crowley had seen Mary Poppins on television one Christmas ( indeed , behind the scenes , Crowley had had a hand in most television ; although it was on the invention of the game show that he truly prided himself ) . He toyed with the idea of a hurricane as an effective and incredibly stylish way of disposing of the queue of nannies that would certainly form , or possible stack up in a holding pattern , outside the Cultural Attaché 's Regent 's Park residence . He contented himself with a wildcat tube strike , and when the day came , only one nanny turned up . She wore a knit tweed suit and discreet pearl earrings . Something about her might have said nanny , but it said it in an undertone of the sort employed by British butlers in a certain type of American film . It also coughed discreetly and muttered that she could well be the sort of nanny who advertises unspecified but strangely explicit services in certain magazines . Her flat shoes crunched up the gravel drive , and a gray dog padded silently by her side , white flecks of saliva dripping from its jaw . Its eyes glinted scarlet , and it glanced from side to side hungrily . She reached the heavy wooden door , smiled to herself , a brief satisfied flicker , and rang the bell . It donged gloomily . The door was opened by a butler , as they say , of the old school . * “
21378	21383	21373	21373	I	0	” she told him . “
21387	21415	21417	21417	Rover	504	” she continued , while the gray dog at her side eyed the butler carefully , working out , perhaps , where it would bury the bones , “
21419	21491	21417	21417	Rover	504	” * A night school just off the Tottenham Court Road , run by an elderly actor who had played butlers and gentlemen 's gentlemen in films and television and on the stage since the 1920s . GOOD OMENS En She left the dog in the garden , and passed her interview with flying colors , and Mrs. Dowling led the nanny to see her new charge . She smiled unpleasantly . "
21497	21501	21417	21417	Rover	504	” she said . "
21511	21639	21502	21502	He	1306	" By one of those coincidences , another new member of staff arrived the same afternoon . He was the gardener , and as it turned out he was amazingly good at his job . No one quite worked out why this should be the case , since he never seemed to pick up a shovel and made no effort to rid the garden of the sudden flocks of birds that filled it and settled all over him at every opportunity . He just sat in the shade while around him the residence gardens bloomed and bloomed . Warlock used to come down to see him , when he was old enough to toddle and Nanny was doing whatever it was she did on her afternoons off . "
21646	21653	21643	21644	Brother Slug	505	” the gardener would tell him , "
21696	21697	21698	21698	Nanny	4381	” "
21716	21738	21713	21714	Mr. Fwancis	507	” said little Warlock , stroking Brother Slug , and then wiping his hand conscientiously on his Kermit the Frog overall . “
21747	21752	21753	21753	You	461	” Francis would say . "
21758	21856	21753	21753	You	461	” At night , Nanny Ashtoreth sang nursery rhymes to Warlock . Oh , the grand old Duke of York He had Ten Thousand Men He Marched them Up To The Top of The Hill And Crushed all the nations of the world and brought them under the rule of Satan our master . and mo This little piggy went to Hades This little piggy stayed home this little piggy ate raw and steaming human flesh this little piggy violated virgins And this little piggy clambered over a heap of dead bodies to get to the top . "
21877	21887	21863	21863	I	0	” said Warlock . 44 NEIL GAIMAN AND TERRY PRATCHETT "
21898	21913	21914	21914	You	0	” the nanny would whisper , as she tucked him into his little bed . “
21919	22370	21917	21917	me	0	” And so it went . The Arrangement worked perfectly . A no - score win . Nanny Ashtoreth bought the child a little tricycle , but could never persuade him to ride it inside the house . And he was scared of Rover . In the background Crowley and Aziraphale met on the tops of buses , and in art galleries , and at concerts , compared notes , and smiled . When Warlock was six , his nanny left , taking Rover with her ; the gardener handed in his resignation on the same day . Neither of them left with quite the same spring in their step with which they 'd arrived . Warlock now found himself being educated by two tutors . Mr. Harrison taught him about Attila the Hun , Vlad Drakul , and the Darkness Intrinsicate in the Human Spirit . * He tried to teach Warlock how to make rabble - rousing political speeches to sway the hearts and minds of multitudes . Mr. Cortese taught him about Florence Nightingale , * * Abraham Lincoln , and the appreciation of art . He tried to teach him about free will , self - denial , and Doing unto Others as You Would Wish Them to Do to You . They both read to the child extensively from the Book of Revelation . Despite their best efforts Warlock showed a regrettable tendency to be good at maths . Neither of his tutors was entirely satisfied with his progress . When Warlock was ten he liked baseball ; he liked plastic toys that transformed into other plastic toys indistinguishable from the first set of plastic toys except to the trained eye ; he liked his stamp collection ; he liked banana - flavor bubble gum ; he liked comics and cartoons and his B.M.X. bike . Crowley was troubled . They were in the cafeteria of the British Museum , another refuge for all weary foot soldiers of the Cold War . At the table to their left two ramrod - straight Americans in suits were surreptitiously handing over a briefcase full of deniable dollars to a small dark woman in sunglasses ; at the table on their right the deputy head of M17 and the local KGB section officer argued over who got to keep the receipt for the tea and buns . * He avoided mentioning that Attila was nice to his mother , or that Vlad Drakul was punctilious about saying his prayers every day . * * Except for the bits about syphilis . GOOD OMENS Crowley finally said what he had not even dared to think for the last decade . "
22376	22383	21917	21917	me	0	” Crowley said to his counterpart , “
22390	22416	22384	22384	he	1317	” Aziraphale popped another deviled egg into his mouth , and washed it down with coffee . He dabbed his lips with a paper napkin . "

23085	23441	23082	23082	you	1334	” Wednesday MA t was a hot , fume - filled August day in Central London . Warlock 's eleventh birthday was very well attended . There were twenty small boys and seventeen small girls . There were a lot of men with identical blond crew cuts , dark blue suits , and shoulder holsters . There was a crew of caterers , who had arrived bearing jellies , cakes , and bowls of crisps . Their procession of vans was led by a vintage Bentley The Amazing Harvey and Wanda , Children 's Parties a Specialty , had both been struck down by an unexpected tummy bug , but by a providential turn of fortune a replacement had turned up , practically out of the blue . A stage magician . Everyone has his little hobby . Despite Crowley 's urgent advice , Aziraphale was intending to turn his to good use . Aziraphale was particularly proud of his magical skills . He had attended a class in the 1870s run by John Maskelyne , and had spent almost a year practicing sleight of hand , palming coins , and taking rabbits out of hats . He had got , he had felt at the time , quite good at it . The point was that although Aziraphale was capable of doing things that could make the entire Magic Circle hand in their wands , he never applied what might be called his intrinsic powers to the practice of sleight - of - hand conjuring . Which was a major drawback . He was beginning to wish that he 'd continued practicing . Still , he mused , it was like riding a velocipede . You never forgot 50 A NEIL GAIMAN AN TERRY PRATCHETT AND how . His magician 's coat had been a little dusty , but it felt good once it was on . Even his old patter began to come back to him . The children watched him in blank , disdainful incomprehension . Behind the buffet Crowley , in his white waiter 's coat , cringed with contact embarrassment . "
23503	23504	23499	23499	Harry	509	” "
23511	23543	23499	23499	Harry	509	” pointed out Warlock . The other children nodded agreement . What did he think they were ? Kids ? Aziraphale remembered what Maskelyne had told him about dealing with hecklers . “

23654	23694	23627	23627	He	0	” Aziraphale stared desperately at Crowley . As far as he was concerned young Warlock was obviously infernally tainted , and the sooner the Black Dog turned up and they could get away from this place , the better . “

24780	24784	24786	24786	Aziraphale	387	“ Oh dear , "
24814	24821	24786	24786	Aziraphale	387	“ I must have missed one . "
24822	24826	24828	24828	Crowley	383	" No dog , ”
24830	24834	24836	24836	Aziraphale	387	" No dog , ”
24842	24848	24849	24849	he	383	“ Get in the car , ”
24852	24867	24849	24849	he	383	“ We 've got to talk about this . Oh , and Aziraphale ... ? “
24870	24871	24849	24849	he	383	" “
24883	24938	24849	24849	he	383	” GOOD OMENS It was a hot , silent August day far from Central London . By the side of the Tadfield road the dust weighed down the hogweed . Bees buzzed in the hedges . The air had a leftover and reheated feel . There was a sound like a thousand metal voices shouting "
24941	25037	24849	24849	he	383	” cut off abruptly . And there was a black dog in the road . It had to be a dog . It was dog - shaped . There are some dogs which , when you meet them , remind you that , despite thousands of years of man - made evolution , every dog is still only two meals away from being a wolf . These dogs advance deliberately , purposefully , the wilderness made flesh , their teeth yellow , their breath a - stink , while in the distance their owners witter , “
25054	25202	24849	24849	he	383	” and in the green of their eyes the red campfires of the Pleistocene gleam and flicker . ... This dog would make even a dog like that slink nonchalantly behind the sofa and pretend to be extremely preoccupied with its rubber bone . It was already growling , and the growl was a low , rumbling snarl of spring - coiled menace , the sort of growl that starts in the back of one throat and ends up in someone else 's . Saliva dripped from its jaws and sizzled on the tar . It took a few steps forward , and sniffed the sullen air . Its ears flicked up . There were voices , a long way off . A voice . A boyish voice , but one it had been created to obey , could not help but obey . When that voice said "
25205	25213	24849	24849	he	383	” it would follow ; when it said “
25216	25285	25286	25286	He	1388	” it would kill . His master 's voice . It leapt the hedge and padded across the field beyond . A grazing bull eyed it for a moment , weighed its chances , then strolled hurriedly toward the opposite hedge . The voices were coming from a copse of straggly trees . The black hound slunk closer , jaws streaming . One of the other voices said : "
25334	25362	25326	25327	your dad	1391	” The hound gave the canine equivalent of a shrug , but immediately lost interest because now the Master , the Center of its Universe , spoke . "
25369	25373	25326	25327	your dad	1391	” it said . “
25429	25435	25416	25416	Your	1390	” NEIL GAIMAN AND TERRY PRATCHETT “
25438	25523	25416	25416	Your	1390	” This third voice was rather more prim than the first two . The owner of a voice like that would be the sort of person who , before making a plastic model kit , would not only separate and count all the parts before commencing , as per the instructions , but also paint the bits that needed painting first and leave them to dry properly prior to construction . All that separated this voice from chartered accountancy was a matter of time . "
25541	25542	25532	25532	You	1390	” “
25566	25784	25785	25785	They	1397	” There was a thoughtful pause . The hound slunk closer , and realized that the voices were coming from a hole in the ground . The trees in fact concealed an ancient chalk quarry , now half overgrown with thorn trees and vines . Ancient , but clearly not disused . Tracks crisscrossed it ; smooth areas of slope indicated regular use by skateboards and Wall - of - Death , or at least Wall - of - Seriously - Grazed - Knee , cyclists . Old bits of dangerously frayed rope hung from some of the more accessible greenery . Here and there sheets of corrugated iron and old wooden boards were wedged in branches . A burnt - out , rusting Triumph Herald Estate was visible , half - submerged in a drift of nettles . In one corner a tangle of wheels and corroded wire marked the site of the famous Lost Graveyard where the supermarket trolleys came to die . If you were a child , it was paradise . The local adults called it The Pit . The hound peered through a clump of nettles , and spotted four figures sitting in the center of the quarry on that indispensable prop to good secret dens everywhere , the common milk crate , “
25789	25790	25791	25791	They	1397	" “
25794	25795	25791	25791	They	1397	” “
25802	25830	25831	25831	They	1397	” said the first speaker . It had a certain timbre to it that identified it as young and female , and it was tinted with horrified fascination “
25863	25864	25858	25861	one big fat one	1400	” "
25900	25907	25884	25887	this big female one	1401	” There was another crowded pause . “
25915	25922	25910	25910	they	1397	” said his Master 's voice . “
25938	25966	25935	25935	I	0	" GOOD OMENS The hound managed to get one huge eye against an empty knothole in the quarry 's broken - down fence , and squinted downward . “
25975	25982	25983	25983	I	0	” said the first speaker authoritatively . "
26025	26026	26008	26008	they	1397	" "
26034	26041	26031	26032	a girl	3907	” said one of the others . “
26062	26063	26064	26064	I	0	” "
26072	26099	26064	26064	I	0	” said his Master 's voice , firmly . His Master had his back to him ; the hound could n't quite make out his features . "
26113	26122	26064	26064	I	0	” said the girl , with withering sarcasm . “
26140	26147	26064	26064	I	0	” said his Master 's voice . “
26153	26163	26064	26064	I	0	" . --the eye in the nettles vanished abruptly downwards- "
26202	26269	26198	26200	A pedigree mongrel	1409	” Unheard by those within , there was a tiny clap of thunder on the lip of the quarry . It might have been caused by the sudden rushing of air into the vacuum caused by a very large dog becoming , for example , a small dog . The tiny popping noise that followed might have been caused by one ear turning itself inside out . "
26276	26283	26284	26284	I	0	" said his Master 's voice . "
26289	26290	26284	26284	I	0	" “
26293	26298	26284	26284	I	0	” said the girl . “
26307	26358	26301	26301	you	0	” The hound waited . This was the moment . The Naming . This would give it its purpose , its function , its identity . Its eyes glowed a dull red , even though they were a lot closer to the ground , and it dribbled into the nettles . “
26365	26372	26359	26359	I	0	" said his Master , positively . "
26385	26487	26488	26488	You	1411	” The hell - hound paused . Deep in its diabolical canine brain it knew that something was wrong , but it was nothing if not obedient and its great sudden love of its Master overcame all misgivings . Who was it to say what size it should be , anyway ? It trotted down the slope to meet its destiny . Strange , though . It had always wanted to jump up at people but , now , it realized that against all expectation it wanted to wag its tail at the same time . 56 NEIL GAIMAN AND TERRY PRATCHETT "
26494	26517	26488	26488	You	1411	” moaned Aziraphale , abstractedly picking the final lump of cream - cake from his lapel . He licked his fingers clean . “
26522	26526	26520	26520	him	1410	” said Crowley . “
26538	26539	26536	26536	I	0	” “

26598	26602	26589	26589	they	1416	” he said . "
26622	26626	26614	26614	they	1416	” said Aziraphale . "
26637	26642	26631	26632	Your lot	1417	” said Crowley sourly . “
26651	26653	26646	26646	you	1411	” . “
26656	26661	26646	26646	you	1411	" said the demon . “
26684	26685	26686	26686	I	0	” “
26690	26691	26686	26686	I	0	” “
26694	26698	26686	26686	I	0	” Aziraphale said : “
26707	26708	26686	26686	I	0	” "
26721	26722	26723	26724	Whose people	1421	” “
26726	26731	26732	26733	My people	4146	” said Aziraphale coldly . “
26735	26739	26732	26733	My people	4146	” corrected Crowley . "
26753	27102	26746	26746	Mmm	532	" He tried to say it dismissively . Apart from , of course , the fact that the world was an amazing interesting place which they both wanted to enjoy for as long as possible , there were few things that the two of them agreed on , but they did see eye to eye about some of those people who , for one reason or another , were inclined to worship the Prince of Darkness . Crowley always found them embarrassing . You could n't actually be rude to them , but you could n't help feeling about them the same way that , say , a Vietnam veteran would feel about someone who wears combat gear to Neighborhood Watch meetings . Besides , they were always so depressingly enthusiastic . Take all that stuff with the inverted crosses and pentagrams and cockerels . It mystified most demons . It was n't the least bit necessary . All you needed to become a Satanist was an effort of will . You could be one all your life without ever knowing what a pentagram was , without ever seeing a dead cockerel other than as Chicken Marengo . Besides , some of the old - style Satanists tended , in fact , to be quite nice people . They mouthed the words and went through the motions , just GOOD OMENS like the people they thought of as their opposite numbers , and then went home and lived lives of mild unassuming mediocrity for the rest of the week with never an unusually evil thought in their heads . And as for the rest of it ... There were people who called themselves Satanists who made Crowley squirm . It was n't just the things they did , it was the way they blamed it all on Hell . They 'd come up with some stomach - churning idea that no demon could have thought of in a thousand years , some dark and mindless unpleasantness that only a fully - functioning human brain could conceive , then shout "
27109	27209	27217	27217	Satanists	1425	” and get the sympathy of the court when the whole point was that the Devil hardly ever made anyone do anything . He did n't have to . That was what some humans found hard to understand . Hell was n't a major reservoir of evil , any more than Heaven , in Crowley 's opinion , was a fountain of goodness ; they were just sides in the great cosmic chess game . Where you found the real McCoy , the real grace and the real heart - stopping evil , was right inside the human mind . "
27212	27216	27217	27217	Satanists	1425	” said Aziraphale . “
27219	27220	27217	27217	Satanists	1425	” "
27233	27237	27238	27238	I	0	” said Crowley . “
27254	27320	27217	27217	Satanists	1425	” He stopped . Through the mists of memory he pictured a small nun , who had struck him at the time as being remarkably loose - headed even for a Satanist . And there had been someone else . Crowley vaguely recalled a pipe , and a cardigan with the kind of zigzag pattern that went out of style in 1938 . A man with “
27323	27341	27238	27238	I	0	" written all over him . There must have been a third baby . He told Aziraphale . “
27349	27354	27238	27238	I	0	" said the angel . “
27363	27367	27238	27238	I	0	” said Crowley , “

27429	27450	27238	27238	I	0	" The Bentley 's engine coughed into life and the car leapt forward , forcing Aziraphale back into the seat . "
27455	27459	27238	27238	I	0	” he said . "
27467	27468	27238	27238	I	0	” "
27473	27487	27238	27238	I	0	” The angel shut his eyes as the car crabbed around a corner . "

27529	27530	27522	27522	you	1430	” “
27547	27548	27544	27545	that pedestrian	1436	” "
27563	27593	27544	27545	that pedestrian	1436	” said Crowley , easing the accelerating car between a parked car and a taxi and leaving a space which would have barely accepted even the best credit card . "
27609	27610	27544	27545	that pedestrian	1436	” “
27616	27622	27544	27545	that pedestrian	1436	” Aziraphale grabbed the dashboard . “
27635	27642	27623	27623	You	1430	” Crowley peered at the dial . “
27646	27650	27651	27651	You	1430	” he said . “
27657	27661	27651	27651	You	1430	” Aziraphale hesitated . “
27665	27675	27651	27651	You	1430	” he corrected , lamely , relaxing a little . “
27684	27848	27678	27678	you	1430	” Crowley shrugged . The angel had never really come to grips with the twentieth century , and did n't realize that it is perfectly possible to do ninety miles an hour down Oxford Street . You just arranged matters so that no one was in the way . And since everyone knew that it was impossible to do ninety miles an hour down Oxford Street , no one noticed . At least cars were better than horses . The internal combustion engine had been a godse a blessi - a windfall for Crowley . The only horses he could be seen riding on business , in the old days , were big black jobs with eyes like flame and hooves that struck sparks . That was de rigueur for a demon . Usually , Crowley fell off . He was n't much good with animals . Somewhere around Chiswick , Aziraphale scrabbled vaguely in the scree of tapes in the glove compartment . "
27855	27859	27860	27860	You	1430	” he said . "
27866	27870	27860	27860	You	1430	” said Crowley . “
27873	27879	27860	27860	You	1430	” said the angel dismissively . “
27884	27885	27860	27860	You	1430	” “
27916	27920	27906	27906	they	1445	” said Crowley . “
27931	27946	27947	27947	You	1430	” said Aziraphale , opening a case and slotting its cassette into the Blaupunkt . “
27953	27957	27947	27947	You	1430	” sighed Crowley . "
27970	27992	27947	27947	You	1430	” A heavy bass beat began to thump through the Bentley as they sped past Heathrow . Aziraphale 's brow furrowed . “
27999	28003	27947	27947	You	1430	” he said . “
28008	28011	28014	28014	Tchaikovsky	534	” GOOD OMENS "
28024	28056	28057	28057	We	1447	” said Crowley , closing his eyes as they went through Slough . To while away the time as they crossed the sleeping Chilterns , they also listened to William Byrd 's “
28061	28065	28066	28066	I	0	” and Beethoven 's "
28072	28081	28066	28066	I	0	” Neither were as good as Vaughan Williams 's “
28087	28392	28057	28057	We	1447	” It is said that the Devil has all the best tunes . This is broadly true . But Heaven has the best choreographers . The Oxfordshire plain stretched out to the west , with a scattering of lights to mark the slumbering villages where honest yeomen were settling down to sleep after a long day 's editorial direction , financial consulting , or software engineering . Up here on the hill a few glow - worms were lighting up . The surveyor 's theodolite is one of the more direful symbols of the twentieth century . Set up anywhere in open countryside , it says : there will come Road Widening , yea , and two - thousand - home estates in keeping with the Essential Character of the Village . Executive Developments will be manifest . But not even the most conscientious surveyor surveys at midnight , and yet here the thing was , tripod legs deep in the turf . Not many theodolites have a hazel twig strapped to the top , either , or crystal pendulums hanging from them and Celtic runes carved into the legs . The soft breeze flapped the cloak of the slim figure who was adjusting the knobs of the thing . It was quite a heavy cloak , sensibly waterproof , with a warm lining . Most books on witchcraft will tell you that witches work naked . This is because most books on witchcraft are written by men . The young woman 's name was Anathema Device . She was not astonishingly beautiful . All her features , considered individually , were extremely pretty , but the entirety of her face gave the impression that it had been put together hurriedly from stock without reference to any plan . Probably the most suitable word is “
28395	28409	28057	28057	We	1447	" although people who knew what it meant and could spell it might add "
28412	28420	28057	28057	We	1447	" although there is something very Fifties about "
28423	28545	28057	28057	We	1447	” so perhaps they would n't . Young women should not go alone on dark nights , even in Oxfordshire . But any prowling maniac would have had more than his work cut 60 NEIL GAIMAN AND TERRY PRATCHETT out if he had accosted Anathema Device . She was a witch , after all . And precisely because she was a witch , and therefore sensible , she put little faith in protective amulets and spells ; she saved it all for a foot - long bread knife which she kept in her belt . She sighted through the glass and made another adjustment . She muttered under her breath . Surveyors often mutter under their breath . They mutter things like “
28561	28563	28558	28559	Jack Robinson	537	" or "
28579	28589	28057	28057	We	1447	” This was an entirely different kind of muttering . "
28597	28601	28057	28057	We	1447	” muttered Anathema , “
28618	28841	28842	28842	You	1453	" She picked up a folded Ordinance Survey map and held it in the torchlight . Then she produced a transparent ruler and a pencil and carefully drew a line across the map . It intersected another pencil line . She smiled , not because anything was particularly amusing , but because a tricky job had been done well ... , Then she collapsed the strange theodolite , strapped it onto the back of a sit - up - and - beg black bicycle leaning against the hedge , made sure the Book was in the basket , and wheeled everything out to the misty lane . It was a very ancient bike , with a frame apparently made of drainpipes . It had been built long before the invention of the three - speed gear , and possibly only just after the invention of the wheel . But it was nearly all downhill to the village . Hair streaming in the wind , cloak ballooning behind her like a sheet anchor , she let the twowheeled juggernaut accelerate ponderously through the warm air . At least there was n't any traffic at this time of night . The Bentley 's engine went pink , pink as it cooled . Crowley 's temper , on the other hand , was heating up . "
28849	28853	28842	28842	You	1453	” he said . “

28878	28893	28866	28866	you	1453	" Crowley hurled the map onto the back seat and started the engine again . “

29028	29037	28919	28923	the first person we see	1458	” said Crowley . Aziraphale stared at him . “

29088	29121	29085	29085	you	1453	” Crowley began . There was a whirr , a scream , and a clunk . The car stopped . Aziraphale blinked , lowered his hands , and gingerly opened the door . “

29187	29207	29142	29142	Someone	3984	” said Aziraphale . A pale blue glow filled the lane . From the ditch beside them someone said , “

29225	29230	29212	29212	you	1453	” said Aziraphale guiltily . “

29250	29282	29243	29243	I	0	" Crowley glared at a long metallic streak on the Bentley 's glossy paintwork and a dimple in the bumper . The dimple popped back into shape . The paint healed . "
29290	29302	29243	29243	I	0	” said the angel , hauling Anathema out of the bracken . “
29307	29335	29243	29243	I	0	” It was a statement , not a hope ; there had been a minor fracture , but Aziraphale could n't resist an opportunity to do good . “

29792	29823	29781	29781	We	1471	” Crowley glared at the new luggage rack . It had tartan straps . The bicycle lifted itself up and tied itself firmly in place . Then Crowley got in . "

29916	30006	29912	29912	I	0	" . Crowley switched on the lights . He did n't need them to see by , but they made the other humans on the road less nervous . Then he put the car into gear and drove sedately down the hill . The road came out from under the trees and , after a few hundred yards , reached the outskirts of a middlesized village . It had a familiar feel to it . It had been eleven years , but this place definitely rang a distant bell . “

30093	30101	30083	30083	I	0	" Crowley leaned across to the angel . “

30125	30129	30119	30119	I	0	” hissed Aziraphale . “

30139	30165	30119	30119	I	0	” Crowley growled . On those occasions when the angel managed to get his mind into the twentieth century , it always gravitated to 1950 . “
30173	30182	30166	30166	You	1483	” said Anathema , from the back seat . "
30186	30280	30166	30166	You	1483	” beamed the angel . As soon as the car had stopped he had the back door open and was bowing like an aged retainer welcoming the young massa back to the old plantation . Anathema gathered her things together and stepped out as haughtily as possible . She was quite sure neither of the two men had gone around to the back of the car , but the bike was unstrapped and leaning against the gate . There was definitely something very weird about them , she decided . Aziraphale bowed again . “
30289	30293	30166	30166	You	1483	" he said . “
30297	30303	30295	30295	you	1483	” said Anathema , icily . “
30309	30313	30295	30295	you	1483	” said Crowley . "
30323	30743	30321	30321	angel	1328	” Ah . Well , that explained it . She had been perfectly safe after all . She watched the car disappear toward the center of the village , and wheeled the bike up the path to the cottage . She had n't bothered to lock it . She was sure that Agnes would have mentioned it if she was going to be burgled , she was always very good at personal things like that . She 'd rented the cottage furnished , which meant that the actual furniture was the special sort you find in these circumstances and had 64 NEIL GAIMAN AND TERRY PRATCHETT probably been left out for the dustmen by the local War on Want shop . It did n't matter . She did n't expect to be here long . If Agnes was right , she would n't be anywhere long . Nor would anyone else . She spread her maps and things out on the ancient table under the kitchen 's solitary light bulb . What had she learned ? Nothing much , she decided . Probably IT was at the north end of the village , but she 'd suspected that anyway . If you got too close the signal swamped you ; if you were too far away you could n't get an accurate fix . It was infuriating . The answer must be in the Book somewhere . The trouble was that in order to understand the Predictions you had to be able to think like a half - crazed , highly intelligent seventeenth - century witch with a mind like a crossword - puzzle dictionary . Other members of the family had said that Agnes made things obscure to conceal them from the understanding of outsiders ; Anathema , who suspected she could occasionally think like Agnes , had privately decided that it was because Agnes was a bloody - minded old bitch with a mean sense of humor . She 'd not evenShe did n't have the book . Anathema stared in horror at the things on the table . The maps . The homemade divinatory theodolite . The thermos that had contained hot Bovril . The torch . The rectangle of empty air where the Prophecies should have been . She 'd lost it . But that was ridiculous ! One of the things Agnes was always very specific about was what happened to the book . She snatched up the torch and ran from the house . "

31321	31424	31442	31444	a Morris Traveller	1510	" He whistled under his breath . The graveled forecourt in front of the manor was crowded with cars , and they were n't nun cars . The Bentley was if anything outclassed . A lot of the cars had GT or Turbo in their names and phone aerials on their roofs . They were nearly all less than a year old . Crowley 's hands itched . Aziraphale healed bicycles and broken bones ; he longed to steal a few radios , let down some tires , that sort of thing . He resisted it . 66 NEIL GAIMAN AND TERRY PRATCHETT "
31429	31433	31442	31444	a Morris Traveller	1510	” he said . “

31493	32137	31486	31486	I	0	" They got out of the car . Thirty seconds later someone shot both of them . With incredible accuracy . o If there was one thing that Mary Hodges , formerly Loquacious , was good at , it was attempting to obey orders . She liked orders . They made the world a simpler place . What she was n't good at was change . She 'd really liked the Chattering Order . She 'd made friends for the first time . She 'd had a room of her own for the first time . Of course , she knew that it was engaged in things which might , from certain viewpoints , be considered bad , but Mary Hodges had seen quite a lot of life in thirty years and had no illusions about what most of the human race had to do in order to make it from one week to the next . Besides , the food was good and you got to meet interesting people . The Order , such as was left of it , had moved after the fire . After all , their sole purpose in existing had been fulfilled . They went their separate ways . She had n't gone . She 'd rather liked the Manor and , she said , someone ought to stay and see it was properly repaired , because you could n't trust workmen these days unless you were on top of them the whole time , in a manner of speaking . This meant breaking her vows , but Mother Superior said this was all right , nothing to worry about , breaking vows was perfectly okay in a black sisterhood , and it would all be the same in a hundred years ' time or , rather , eleven years ' time , so if it gave her any pleasure here were the deeds and an address to forward any mail unless it came in long brown envelopes with windows in the front . Then something very strange had happened to her . Left alone in the rambling building , working from one of the few undamaged rooms , arguing with men with cigarette stubs behind their ears and plaster dust on their trousers and the kind of pocket calculator that comes up with a different answer if the sums involved are in used notes , she discovered something she never knew existed . She 'd discovered , under layers of silliness and eagerness to please , Mary Hodges . GOOD OMENS 67 She found it quite easy to interpret builders ' estimates and do VAT calculations . She 'd got some books from the library , and found finance to be both interesting and uncomplicated . She 'd stopped reading the kind of women 's magazine that talks about romance and knitting and started reading the kind of women 's magazine that talks about orgasms , but apart from making a mental note to have one if ever the occasion presented itself she dismissed them as only romance and knitting in a new form . So she 'd started reading the kind of magazine that talked about mergers . After much thought , she 'd bought a small home computer from an amused and condescending young dealer in Norton . After a crowded weekend , she took it back . Not , as he thought when she walked back into the shop , to have a plug put on it , but because it did n't have a 387 coprocessor . That bit he understood he was a dealer , after all , and could understand quite long words — but after that the conversation rapidly went downhill from his point of view . Mary Hodges produced yet more magazines . Most of them had the term “
32139	32579	32656	32656	they	1513	” somewhere in their title , and many of them had articles and reviews that she had circled carefully in red ink . She read about New Women . She had n't ever realized that she 'd been an Old Woman , but after some thought she decided that titles like that were all one with the romance and the knitting and the orgasms , and the really important thing to be was yourself , just as hard as you could . She 'd always been inclined to dress in black and white . All she needed to do was raise the hemlines , raise the heels , and leave off the wimple . It was while leafing through a magazine one day that she learned that , around the country , there was an apparently insatiable demand for commodious buildings in spacious grounds run by people who understood the needs of the business community . The following day she went out and ordered some stationery in the name of the Tadfield Manor Conference and Management Training Center , reasoning that by the time it had been printed she 'd know all that was necessary to know about running such places . The ads went out the following week . It had turned out to be an overwhelming success , because Mary Hodges realized early in her new career as Herself that management training did n't have to mean sitting people down in front of unreliable slide projectors . Firms expected far more than that these days . She provided it . inceadyt Crowley sank down with his back against a statue . Aziraphale had already toppled backward into a rhododendron bush , a dark stain spreading across his coat . NEIL GAIMAN AND TERRY PRATCHETT Crowley felt dampness suffusing his own shirt . This was ridiculous . The last thing he needed now was to be killed . It would require all sorts of explanations . They did n't hand out new bodies just like that ; they always wanted to know what you 'd done with the old one . It was like trying to get a new pen from a particularly bloody - minded stationery department . He looked at his hand in disbelief . Demons have to be able to see in the dark . And he could see that his hand was yellow . He was bleeding yellow . Gingerly , he tasted a finger . Then he crawled over to Aziraphale and checked the angel 's shirt . If the stain on it was blood , something had gone very wrong with biology . "
32585	32591	32656	32656	they	1513	” moaned the fallen angel . "

32610	32643	32605	32605	you	0	” said Crowley . Aziraphale 's eyes opened . His right hand patted his chest . He sat up . He went through the same crude forensic self - examination as Crowley . “
32646	32653	32656	32656	they	1513	” he said . Crowley nodded . “
32660	32664	32656	32656	they	1513	” said Aziraphale . "
32670	32674	32656	32656	they	1513	” said Crowley , “
32684	33154	32676	32676	I	0	” His tone suggested that he could play , too . And do it better . It was a game . It was tremendous fun . Nigel Tompkins , Assistant Head ( Purchasing ) , squirmed through the undergrowth , his mind aflame with some of the more memorable scenes of some of the better Clint Eastwood movies . And to think he 'd believed that management training was going to be boring , too . .... There had been a lecture , but it had been about the paint guns and all the things you should never do with them , and Tompkins had looked at the fresh young faces of his rival trainees as , to a man , they resolved to do them all if there was half a chance of getting away with it . If people told you business was a jungle and then put a gun in your hand , then it was pretty obvious to Tompkins that they were n't expecting you to simply aim for the shirt ; what it was all about was the corporate head hanging over your fireplace . Anyway , it was rumored that someone over in United Consolidated had done his promotion prospects a considerable amount of good by the anonymous application of a high - speed earful of paint to an immediate superior , causing the latter to complain of little ringing noises in important meetings and eventually to be replaced on medical grounds . And there were his fellow trainees — fellow sperms , to switch metaphors , all struggling forward in the knowledge that there could only ever GOOD OMENS 69 be one Chairman of Industrial Holdings ( Holdings ) PLC , and that the job would probably go to the biggest prick . Of course , some girl with a clipboard from Personnel had told them that the courses they were going on were just to establish leadership potential , group cooperation , initiative , and so on . The trainees had tried to avoid one another 's faces . It had worked quite well so far . The white - water canoeing had taken care of Johnstone ( punctured eardrum ) and the mountain climbing in Wales had done for Whittaker ( groin strain ) . Tompkins thumbed another paint pellet into the gun and muttered business mantras to himself . Do Unto Others Before They Do Unto You . Kill or Be Killed . Either Shit or Get Out of the Kitchen . Survival of the Fittest . Make My Day . He crawled a little nearer to the figures by the statue . They did n't seem to have noticed him . When the available cover ran out , he took a deep breath and leapt to his feet . "
33165	33190	33191	33191	I	0	" Where one of the figures had been there was something dreadful . He blacked out . Crowley restored himself to his favorite shape . "

33238	33284	33236	33236	myself	0	” said Aziraphale , but without much rancor . Angels had certain moral standards to maintain and so , unlike Crowley , he preferred to buy his clothes rather than wish them into being from raw firmament . And the shirt had been quite expensive . “

33375	33394	33366	33366	I	0	” he said . There was a pinging noise , and the statue beside them lost an ear . “

33513	33735	33468	33468	They	1520	” He dropped the gun onto the recumbent form of Tompkins and marched away across the damp lawn . The front door of the Manor was unlocked . The pair of them walked through unheeded . Some plump young men in army fatigues spattered with paint were drinking cocoa out of mugs in what had once been the sisters ' refectory , and one or two of them gave them a cheery wave . Something like a hotel reception desk now occupied one end of the hall . It had a quietly competent look . Aziraphale gazed at the board on an aluminum easel beside it . In little plastic letters let into the black fabric of the board were the words : August 20–21 : United Holdings ( Holdings ) PLC Initiative Combat Course . Meanwhile Crowley had picked up a pamphlet from the desk . It showed glossy pictures of the Manor , with special references to its Jacuzzis and indoor heated swimming pool , and on the back was the sort of map that conference centers always have , which makes use of a careful misscaling to suggest that it is handy for every motorway exit in the nation while carefully leaving out the labyrinth of country lanes that in fact surrounds it for miles on every side . "
33739	33743	33468	33468	They	1520	” said Aziraphale . "
33746	33747	33468	33468	They	1520	" “
33753	33754	33468	33468	They	1520	” “
33757	33907	33468	33468	They	1520	” Crowley leafed through the booklet , in the hope of any clue . Perhaps it was too much to hope that the Chattering Order would still be here . After all , they 'd done their bit . He hissed softly . Probably they 'd gone to darkest America or somewhere , to convert the Christians , but he read on anyway . Sometimes this sort of leaflet had a little historical bit , because the kind of companies that hired places like this for a weekend of Interactive Personnel Analysis or A Conference on the Strategic Marketing Dynamic liked to feel that they were strategically interacting in the very building - give or take a couple of complete rebuildings , a civil war , and two major fires that some Elizabethan financier had endowed as a plague hospital . Not that he was actually expecting a sentence like "
33938	33962	33923	33934	Satanic nuns who were n't in fact all that good at it	1523	” but you never knew . A plump man wearing desert camouflage and holding a polystyrene cup of coffee wandered up to them . “
33967	33972	33973	33977	Young Evanson of Forward Planning	549	” he said chummily . "
33990	33994	33995	33995	We	1525	" GOOD OMENS 7 “
34002	34089	33995	33995	We	1525	” said Crowley absently . There was a burst of firing from the grounds . Not the snap and zing of pellets , but the full - throated crackle of aerodynamically shaped bits of lead traveling extremely fast . There was an answering stutter . The redundant warriors stared one on another . A further burst took out a rather ugly Victorian stained glass window beside the door and stitched a row of holes in the plaster by Crowley 's head . Aziraphale grabbed his arm . "
34096	34213	34214	34214	I	0	” he said . Crowley smiled like a snake . Nigel Tompkins had come to with a ' mild headache and a vaguely empty space in his recent memory . He was not to know that the human brain , when faced with a sight too terrible to contemplate , is remarkably good at scabbing it over with forced forgetfulness , so he put it down to a pellet strike on the head . He was vaguely aware that his gun was somewhat heavier , but in his mildly bemused state he did not realize why until some time after he 'd pointed it at trainee manager Norman Wethered from Internal Audit and pulled the trigger . “
34224	34228	34219	34219	you	1526	” said Crowley . “
34246	34247	34249	34249	you	0	” “
34260	34264	34249	34249	you	0	" said Aziraphale . “

34321	34328	34329	34330	The bastards	1530	" said the Deputy Financial Manager . “
34332	34356	34329	34330	The bastards	1530	” A shot pinged off the wall above him . He crawled hurriedly over to the little group clustered around the fallen Wethered . “
34362	34384	34329	34330	The bastards	1530	” he said . The assistant Head of Wages turned a haggard face toward him . 72 NEIL GAIMAN AND TERRY PRATCHETT “
34388	34392	34329	34330	The bastards	1530	” he said . “
34411	34412	34406	34406	Diners	1532	” “
34424	34452	34406	34406	Diners	1532	” said Wethered . They looked in mute horror at the spectacle of a credit card wallet with a bullet hole nearly all the way through it . “
34459	34675	34455	34455	they	1529	” said a wages officer . The head of Internal Audit opened his mouth to say something reasonable , and did n't . Everyone had a point where they crack , and his had just been hit with a spoon . Twenty years in the job . He 'd wanted to be a graphic designer but the careers master had n't heard of that . Twenty years of double - checking Form BF18 . Twenty years of cranking the bloody hand calculator , when even the people in Forward Planning had computers . And now for reasons unknown , but possibly to do with reorganization and a desire to do away with all the expense of early retirement , they were shooting at him with bullets . The armies of paranoia marched behind his eyes . He looked down at his own gun . Through the mists of rage and bewilderment he saw that it was bigger and blacker than it had been when it was issued to him . It felt heavier , too . He aimed it at a bush nearby and watched a stream of bullets blow the bush into oblivion . Oh . So that was their game . Well , someone had to win . He looked at his men . “
34680	34684	34678	34678	guys	1534	” he said , "
34691	34692	34678	34678	guys	1534	” “

34712	34722	34704	34705	no one	4099	” He gave Aziraphale a bright and brittle grin . “
34726	34730	34704	34705	no one	4099	” he said . “
34742	34784	34738	34738	everyone	3880	” Bullets streaked across the night . Jonathan Parker , Purchasing Section , was wriggling through the bushes when one of them put an arm around his neck . Nigel Tompkins spat a cluster of rhododendron leaves out of his mouth . “
34792	34802	34738	34738	everyone	3880	” he hissed , through mud - encrusted features , “

34823	34835	34808	34808	me	0	" said Aziraphale , as they strolled along the empty corridors . “

35292	35309	35285	35285	He	383	" I 'll wake her up again , shall I ? And you can say it . "
35310	35320	35322	35323	the angel	906	“ Well . Since you put it like that ... ”
35326	35334	35336	35336	Crowley	383	" Sometimes the old ways are best , ”
35345	35355	35356	35356	he	383	“ Were you a nun here eleven years ago ? ”

35475	35491	35472	35472	she	540	" Is there any possibility that the switch could have gone wrong in some way ? ”

35566	35576	35563	35563	Aziraphale	387	“ There was a fire just after the birth . ”
35587	35594	35595	35595	he	383	“ That was Hastur , probably , "
35598	35620	35595	35595	he	383	“ It 's his style . Can you believe those guys ? I bet he thought he was being really clever . ”
35621	35632	35634	35634	Aziraphale	387	“ Do you recall any details about the other child ? ”

35822	35825	35827	35827	Crowley	383	“ Okay , ”
35829	35851	35827	35827	Crowley	383	“ That 's it . That 's it . It was worth a try . Let 's get out of here . ”

36009	36049	35999	35999	Crowley	383	" Bookings will double , you mark my words . If she plays her cards right , sorts out the waivers , ties up all the legal bits . Initiative training with real guns ? They 'll form queues . ”
36050	36058	36079	36079	Aziraphale	387	“ Why are you always so cynical ? ”
36059	36069	36070	36070	They	1559	“ I said . Because it 's my job . ”
36082	36106	36079	36079	Aziraphale	387	“ You 'd think he 'd show up , would n't you ? You 'd think we could detect him in some way . ”
36107	36140	35999	35999	Crowley	383	“ He wo n't show up . Not to us . Protective camouflage . He wo n't even know it , but his powers will keep him hidden from prying occult forces . ”
36141	36145	36070	36070	They	1559	" Occult forces ? ”
36146	36151	36153	36153	Crowley	383	" You and me , ”
36155	36161	36163	36163	Aziraphale	387	" I 'm not occult , ”
36165	36175	36163	36163	Aziraphale	387	" Angels are n't occult . We 're ethereal . ”
36176	36179	36181	36181	Crowley	383	“ Whatever , ”
36188	36198	36199	36199	Crowley	383	" Is there some other way of locating him ? "
36202	36206	36207	36207	he	383	“ Search me , ”
36210	36246	36207	36207	he	383	“ How much experience do you think I 've got in these matters ? Armageddon only happens once , you know . They do n't let you go around again until you get it right . ”
36262	36269	36270	36270	he	906	“ It all seems so peaceful , ”
36273	36282	36270	36270	he	906	" How do you think it will happen ? ”
36283	36312	36319	36319	Aziraphale	387	" Well , thermonuclear extinction has always been very popular . Although I must say the big boys are being quite polite to each other at the moment . ”
36313	36317	36319	36319	Aziraphale	387	“ Asteroid strike ? ”
36321	36351	36319	36319	Aziraphale	387	“ Quite the fashion these days , I understand . Strike into the Indian Ocean , great big cloud of dust and vapor , goodbye all higher life forms . "
36352	36355	36357	36357	Crowley	383	" Wow , ”
36371	36382	36384	36384	Aziraphale	387	“ Does n't bear thinking about it , does it , ”
36387	36400	36384	36384	Aziraphale	387	" All the higher life forms scythed away , just like that . ”
36401	36404	36319	36319	Aziraphale	387	“ Terrible . ”
36405	36412	36440	36440	Aziraphale	387	" Nothing but dust and fundamentalists . "
36413	36418	36384	36384	Aziraphale	387	" That was nasty . "
36419	36427	36319	36319	Aziraphale	387	“ Sorry . Could n't resist it . ”
36434	36439	36440	36440	Aziraphale	387	“ Maybe some terrorist- ? ”
36443	36449	36451	36451	Crowley	383	“ Not one of ours , ”
36453	36457	36459	36459	Aziraphale	387	“ Or ours , ”
36461	36471	36459	36459	Aziraphale	387	“ Although ours are freedom fighters , of course . ”
36472	36479	36481	36481	Crowley	383	“ I 'll tell you what , ”
36490	36508	36481	36481	Crowley	383	“ Cards on the table time . I 'll tell you ours if you tell me yours . ”
36509	36516	36459	36459	Aziraphale	387	“ All right . You first . ”
36517	36525	36459	36459	Aziraphale	387	“ Oh , no . You first . ”
36526	36533	36481	36481	Crowley	383	“ But you 're a demon . ”
36534	36548	36549	36549	Aziraphale	387	“ Yes , but a demon of my word , I should hope . ”
36566	36569	36571	36571	Crowley	383	" See ? ”
36573	36598	36571	36571	Crowley	383	“ It 's just like I 've always said . They 're cunning buggers , humans . You ca n't trust them an inch . "
36599	36614	36616	36616	Aziraphale	387	“ But I do n't think any of ours have any big plans afoot , ”
36618	36628	36629	36629	he	387	“ Just minor acts of ter - political protest , ”
36632	36635	36637	36637	Crowley	383	“ Ah , ”
36640	36663	36637	36637	Crowley	383	" You mean none of this cheap , massproduced murder ? Just personal service , every bullet individually fired by skilled craftsmen ? ”
36671	36680	36664	36664	Aziraphale	387	" What are we going to do now ? "
36681	36688	36637	36637	Crowley	383	" Try and get some sleep . ”
36689	36713	36637	36637	Crowley	383	“ You do n't need sleep . I do n't need sleep . Evil never sleeps , and Virtue is ever - vigilant . ”
36714	36740	36741	36741	He	383	“ Evil in general , maybe . This specific part of it has got into the GOOD OMENS habit of getting its head down occasionally . ”
36849	36853	36855	36855	Crowley	383	“ For me , ”
36880	36896	36898	36898	Aziraphale	387	“ Of course , we might be able to get a human to find him , "
36901	36904	36906	36906	Crowley	383	“ What ? ”
36910	36973	36906	36906	Crowley	383	“ Humans are good at finding other humans . They 've been doing it for thousands of years . And the child is human . As well as ... you know . He would be hidden from us , but other humans might be able to ... oh , sense him , perhaps . Or spot things we would n't think of . "
36974	37046	37047	37047	he	383	“ It would n't work . He 's the Antichrist ! He 's got this . . . sort of automatic defense , has n't he ? Even if he does n't know it . It wo n't even let people suspect him . Not yet . Not till it 's ready . Suspicion will slide off him like , like . . . whatever it is water slides off of , ”
37051	37063	37065	37065	Aziraphale	387	“ Got any better ideas ? Got one single better idea ? ”
37067	37070	37065	37065	Aziraphale	387	" No . "
37071	37111	36906	36906	Crowley	383	“ Right , then . It could work . Do n't tell me you have n't got any front organizations you could use . I know I have . We could see if they can pick up the trail . ”
37112	37123	37065	37065	Aziraphale	387	" What could they do that we could n't do ? ”
37124	37149	37065	37065	Aziraphale	387	" Well , for a start , they would n't get people to shoot one another , they would n't hypnotize respectable women , they "
37150	37182	37183	37183	Crowley	383	" Okay . Okay . But it has n't got a snowball 's chance in Hell . Believe me , I know . But I ca n't think of anything better . ”
37193	37204	37206	37206	Aziraphale	387	“ I have a - a certain network of agents , ”
37212	37228	37206	37206	Aziraphale	387	" Spread across the country . A disciplined force . I could set them searching . ”
37229	37238	37239	37239	Crowley	383	“ I , er , have something similar , ”
37242	37259	37239	37239	Crowley	383	“ You know how it is , you never know when they might come in handy ... "
37260	37276	37277	37277	Crowley	383	“ We 'd better alert them . Do you think they ought to work together ? ”
37288	37300	37301	37301	he	383	“ I do n't think that would be a good idea , ”
37304	37314	37301	37301	he	383	“ They 're not very sophisticated , politically speaking . "

37750	37782	37711	37711	Crowley	383	” said the angel . He fumbled for his keys , dropped them on the pavement , picked them up , dropped them again , and hurried to the shop door . “
37793	37811	37791	37791	we	1585	” Crowley called after him . GOOD OMENS Aziraphale paused in the act of turning the key . “

37830	37837	37711	37711	Crowley	383	” And he slammed the door . “
37840	38205	37711	37711	Crowley	383	” mumbled Crowley , suddenly feeling very alone . Torchlight flicked in the lanes . The trouble with trying to find a brown - covered book among brown leaves and brown water at the bottom of a ditch of brown earth in the brown , well , grayish light of dawn , was that you could n't . It was n't there . Anathema tried every method of search she could think of . There was the methodical quartering of the ground . There was the slapdash poking at the bracken by the roadside . There was the nonchalant sidling up to it and looking out of the side of her eye . She even tried the one which every romantic nerve in her body insisted should work , which consisted of theatrically giving up , sitting down , and letting her glance fall naturally on a patch of earth which , if she had been in any decent narrative , should have contained the book . It did n't . Which meant , as she had feared all along , that it was probably in the back of a car belonging to two consenting cycle repairmen . She could feel generations of Agnes Nutter 's descendants laughing at her . Even if those two were honest enough to want to return it , they 'd hardly go to all the trouble of finding a cottage they 'd barely seen in the dark . The only hope was that they would n't know what it was they 'd got . ziraphale , like many Soho merchants who specialized in hard - to - find books for the discerning connoisseur , had a back room , but what was in there was far more esoteric than anything normally 80 NEIL GAIMAN AND TERRY PRATCHETT found inside a shrink - wrapped bag for the Customer Who Knows What He Wants . He was particularly proud of his books of prophecy . First editions , usually . And every one was signed . He 'd got Robert Nixon , * and Martha the Gypsy , and Ignatius Sybilla , and Old Ottwell Binns . Nostradamus had signed , “
38215	38253	37711	37711	Crowley	383	” ; Mother Shipton had spilled drink on his copy ; and in a climate - controlled cabinet in one corner was the original scroll in the shaky handwriting of St. John the Divine of Patmos , whose "
38255	38603	38840	38842	Red ” Zuigiber	568	" had been the all - time best seller . Aziraphale had found him a nice chap , if a bit too fond of odd mushrooms . What the collection did not have was a copy of The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter , and Aziraphale walked into the room holding it as a keen philatelist might hold a Mauritius Blue that had just turned up on a postcard from his aunt . He 'd never even seen a copy before , but he 'd heard about it . Everyone in the trade , which considering it was a highly specialized trade meant about a dozen people , had heard of it . Its existence was a sort of vacuum around which all sorts of strange stories had been orbiting for hundreds of years . Aziraphale realized he was n't sure if you could orbit a vacuum , and did n't care ; The Nice and Accurate Prophecies made the Hitler Diaries look like , well , a bunch of forgeries . His hands hardly shook at all as he laid it down on a bench , pulled on a pair of surgical rubber gloves , and opened it reverentially . Aziraphale was an angel , but he also worshiped books . The title page said : The Nife and Accurate Prophefies of Agnes Nutter In slightly smaller type : Being a Certaine and Prefice Hiftory from the Prefent Day Unto the Endinge of this world . In slightly larger type : Containing therein Many Diuerse Wonders and precepts for the Wife * A sixteenth - century half - wit , not related to any U.S. president .

38608	38839	38840	38842	Red ” Zuigiber	568	” Aziraphale muttered to himself . He went into the little kitchenette and made himself some cocoa and took some deep breaths . Then he came back and read a prophecy at random . Forty minutes later , the cocoa was still untouched . The red - haired woman in the corner of the hotel bar was the most successful war correspondent in the world . She now had a passport in the name of Carmine Zuigiber ; and she went where the wars were . Well . More or less . Actually she went where the wars were n't . She 'd already been where the wars were . She was not well known , except where it counted . Get half a dozen war correspondents together in an airport bar , and the conversation will , like a compass orienting to North , swing around to Murchison of The New York Times , to Van Horne of Newsweek , to Anforth of I.T.N. News . The war correspondents ' War Correspondents . But when Murchison , and Van Horne , and Anforth ran into each other in a burnt - out tin shack in Beirut , or Afghanistan , or the Sudan , after they 'd admired each other 's scars and had downed a few , they would 82 NEIL GAIMAN AND TERRY PRATCHETT exchange awed anecdotes of “
38841	38850	38840	38842	Red ” Zuigiber	568	” Zuigiber , from the National World Weekly . "
38855	38860	38840	38842	Red ” Zuigiber	568	” Murchison would say , “
38872	39185	39186	39186	Jesus	569	" Actually the National World Weekly did know just what it had got : it had a War Correspondent . It just did n't know why , or what to do with one now it had her . A typical National World Weekly would tell the world how Jesus ' face was seen on a Big Mac bun bought by someone from Des Moines , with an artist 's impression of the bun ; how Elvis Presley was recently sighted working in a Burger Lord in Des Moines ; how listening to Elvis records cured a Des Moines housewife 's cancer ; how the spate of werewolves infesting the Midwest are the offspring of noble pioneer women raped by Bigfoot ; and that Elvis was taken by Space Aliens in 1976 because he was too good for this world . * That was the National World Weekly . They sold four million copies a week , and they needed a War Correspondent like they needed an exclusive interview with the General Secretary of the United Nations . * * So they paid Red Zuigiber a great deal of money to go and find wars , and ignored the bulging , badly typed envelopes she sent them occasionally from around the globe to justify her - generally fairly reasonable -expense claims . They felt justified in this because , as they saw it , she really was n't a very good war correspondent although she was undoubtedly the most attractive , which counted for a lot on the National World Weekly . Her war reports were always about a bunch of guys shooting at each other , with no real understanding of the wider political ramifications , and , more importantly , no Human Interest . Occasionally they would hand one of her stories over to a rewrite man to fix up . ( “
39250	39358	39237	39237	he	569	" ) Mostly the National World Weekly left her alone , and carefully filed her stories in the rubbish bin . * Remarkably , one of these stories is indeed true . * * The interview was done in 1983 and went as follows : Q : You 're the Secretary of the United Nations , then ? A : Si Q : Ever sighted Elvis ? GOOD OMENS And smile World Webought an Murchison , and Van Horne , and Anforth did n't care about this . All they knew was that whenever a war broke out , Ms. Zuigiber was there first . Practically before . "
39365	39373	39237	39237	he	569	” they would ask each other incredulously . “
39382	39703	39378	39378	she	1591	” And their eyes would meet , and silently say : if she was a car she 'd be made by Ferrari , she 's the kind of woman you 'd expect to see as the beautiful consort to the corrupt generalissimo of a collapsing Third World country , and she hangs around with guys like us . We 're the lucky guys , right ? Ms. Zuigiber just smiled and bought another round of drinks for everybody , on the National World Weekly . And watched the fights break out around her . And smiled . She had been right . Journalism suited her . Even so , everyone needs a holiday , and Red Zuigiber was on her first in eleven years . She was on a small Mediterranean island which made its money from the tourist trade , and that in itself was odd . Red looked to be the kind of woman who , if she took a holiday on any island smaller than Australia , would be doing so because she was friends with the man who owned it . And had you told any islander a month before that war was coming , he would have laughed at you and tried to sell you a raffiawork wine holder or a picture of the bay done in seashells ; that was then . This was now . Now a deep religio - political divide , concerning which of four small mainland countries they were n't actually a part of , had split the country into three factions , destroyed the statue of Santa Maria in the town square , and done for the tourist trade . Red Zuigiber sat in the bar of the Hotel de Palomar del Sol , drinking what passed for a cocktail . In one corner a tired pianist played , and a waiter in a toupee crooned into a microphone : “
39731	39760	39761	39761	I	0	" A man threw himself through the window , a knife between his teeth , a Kalashnikov automatic rifle in one hand , a grenade in the other . “

Red unconcernedly withdrew the maraschino cherry from her drink , put it to her scarlet lips , and sucked it slowly off its stick in a way that made several men in the room break into a cold sweat . The pianist stood up , reached into his piano , and pulled out a vintage sub - machine gun . “

They always maintained that one of the nice things about going on holiday was not having to read the newspapers or listen to the news , just getting away from it all really . And due to a tummy bug contracted by Mr. Threlfall , and Mrs. Threlfall rather overdoing it in the sun their first day , this was their first time out of their hotel room for a week and a half .

40430	40508	40398	40407	The next person who says anything . Anything at all	1616	” Nobody moved . They were n't listening to him any more . They were listening to a low , indistinct murmuring from the hallway behind him , quiet and monotonous . There was some shuffling among the cohort in the doorway . They seemed to be doing their best to stand firm , but they were being inexorably edged out of the way by the muttering , which had begun to resolve itself into audible phrases . “
40588	40743	40748	40748	miss	1285	" Sliding serenely past the men with guns , like a pike through a trout pond , came a small , bespectacled man in a blue uniform , carrying a long , thin , brown paper - wrapped parcel , tied with string . His sole concession to the climate were his open - toed brown plastic sandals , although the green woolen socks he wore underneath them showed his deep and natural distrust of foreign weather . He had a peaked cap on , with International Express written on it in large white letters . He was unarmed , but no one touched him . No one even pointed a gun at him . They just stared . The little man looked around the room , scanning the faces , and then looking back down at his clipboard ; then he walked straight over to Red , still sitting on her bar stool . “
40750	40798	40748	40748	miss	1285	” he said . Red took it , and began to untie the string . The International Express man coughed discreetly and presented the journalist with a well - thumbed receipt pad and a yellow plastic ballpoint pen attached to the clipboard by a piece of string . "

40827	41065	40812	40812	your	1624	” Red signed the receipt pad , illegibly , then printed her name . The name she wrote was not Carmine Zuigiber . It was a much shorter name . The man thanked her kindly , and made his way out , muttering 86 NEIL GAIMAN AND TERRY PRATCHETT , but , failin . Cry obviouslugical sword lovely place you 've got here , gents , always meant to come out here on holiday , sorry to trouble you , excuse me , sir . . . And he passed out of their lives as serenely as he had come . Red finished opening the parcel . People began to edge around to get a better look . Inside the package was a large sword . She examined it . It was a very straightforward sword , long and sharp ; it looked both old and unused ; and it had nothing ornamental or impressive about it . This was no magical sword , no mystic weapon of power and might . It was very obviously a sword created to slice , chop , cut , preferably kill , but , failing that , irreparably maim , a very large number of people indeed . It had an indefinable aura of hatred and menace . Red clasped the hilt in her exquisitely manicured right hand , and held it up to eye level . The blade glinted . "
41068	41078	40812	40812	your	1624	” she said , stepping down from the stool . “
41081	41108	40812	40812	your	1624	" She finished the drink , hefted the sword over one shoulder , and looked around at the puzzled factions , who now encircled her completely . "

41134	41228	41116	41116	chaps	1628	" The men in the room suddenly realized that they did n't want to know her better . She was beautiful , but she was beautiful in the way a forest fire was beautiful : something to be admired from a distance , not up close . And she held her sword , and she smiled like a knife . There were a number of guns in that room , and slowly , tremblingly , they were focused on her chest , and her back , and head . They encircled her completely . "
41233	41398	41116	41116	chaps	1628	” croaked Pedro . Everybody else nodded . Red shrugged . She began to walk forward . Every finger on every trigger tightened , almost of its own accord . Lead and the smell of cordite filled the air . Red 's cocktail glass smashed in her hand . The room 's remaining mirrors exploded in lethal shards . Part of the ceiling fell down . And then it was over . Carmine Zuigiber turned and stared at the bodies surrounding her as if she had n't the faintest idea of how they came to be there . She licked a spatter of blood - someone else's — from the back of her hand with a scarlet , cat - like tongue . Then she smiled . And she walked out of the bar , her heels clicking on the tiles like the tapping of distant hammers . The two holidaymakers climbed out from under the table and surveyed the carnage . GOOD OMENS 87 "

41457	41530	41531	41531	She	1631	” said Mrs. Threlfall , completely missing the significance of what had just happened . It meant there would n't be any next year . It rather lowered the odds on there being any next week to speak of . Thursday H here was a newcomer in the village . New people were always a source of interest and speculation among the Them , * but this time Pepper had impressive news . “

41600	41686	41589	41589	My	0	” said Wensleydale , who had fair , wavy hair , and peered seriously out at life through thick black - rimmed spectacles . It was widely believed that he had once . been christened Jeremy , but no one ever used the name , not even his parents , who called him Youngster . They did this in the subconscious hope that he might take the hint ; Wensleydale gave the impression of having been born with a mental age of forty - seven . “
41693	41713	41714	41714	I	0	” said Brian , who had a wide , cheerful face , under an apparently permanent layer of grime . “

42033	42038	42014	42014	She	1662	” said Wensleydale darkly . “

42054	42055	42014	42014	She	1662	" “
42061	42893	42014	42014	She	1662	” said Pepper . Brian snorted . If it had been Wensley who had said that , there 'd have been a half - hearted scuffle , as between friends . But the other Them had long ago learned that Pepper did not consider herself bound by the informal conventions of brotherly scuffles . She could kick and bite with astonishing physiological accuracy for a girl of eleven . Besides , at eleven years old the Them were beginning to be bothered by the dim conception that laying hands on good ole Pep moved things into blood - thumping categories they were n't entirely at home with yet , besides earning you a snake - fast blow that would have floored the Karate Kid . . But she was good to have in your gang . They remembered with pride the time when Greasy Johnson and his gang had taunted them for playing with a girl . Pepper had erupted with a fury that had caused Greasy 's mother to come round that evening and complain . * Pepper looked upon him , a giant male , as a natural enemy . * Greasy Johnson was a sad and oversized child . There 's one in every school ; not exactly fat , but simply huge and wearing almost the same size clothes as his father . Paper tore under his tremendous fingers , pens shattered in his grip . Children whom he tried to play with in quiet , friendly games ended up getting under his huge feet , and Greasy Johnson had become a bully almost in self - defense . After all , it was better to be called a bully , which at least implied some sort of control and desire , than to be called a big clumsy oaf . He was the despair of the sports master , because if Greasy Johnson had taken the slightest interest in sport , then the school could have been champions . But Greasy Johnson had never found a sport that suited him . He was instead secretly devoted to his collection of tropical fish , which won him prizes . Greasy Johnson was the same age as Adam Young , to within a few hours , and his parents had never told him he was adopted . See ? You were right about the babies . GOOD OMENS 93 She herself had short red hair and a face which was not so much freckled as one big freckle with occasional areas of skin . Pepper 's given first names were Pippin Galadriel Moonchild . She had been given them in a naming ceremony in a muddy valley field that contained three sick sheep and a number of leaky polythene teepees . Her mother had chosen the Welsh valley of Pant - y - Gyrdl as the ideal site to Return to Nature . ( Six months later , sick of the rain , the mosquitoes , the men , the tent - trampling sheep who ate first the whole commune 's marijuana crop and then its antique minibus , and by now beginning to glimpse why almost the entire drive of human history has been an attempt to get as far away from Nature as possible , Pepper 's mother returned to Pepper 's surprised grandparents in Tadfield , bought a bra , and enrolled in a sociology course with a deep sigh of relief . ) There are only two ways a child can go with a name like Pippin Galadriel Moonchild , and Pepper had chosen the other one : the three male Them had learned this on their first day of school , in the playground , at the age of four . They had asked her her name , and , all innocent , she had told them . Subsequently a bucket of water had been needed to separate Pippin Galadriel Moonchild 's teeth from Adam 's shoe . Wensleydale 's first pair of spectacles had been broken , and Brian 's sweater needed five stitches . The Them were together from then on , and Pepper was Pepper forever , except to her mother , and ( when they were feeling especially courageous , and the Them were almost out of earshot ) Greasy Johnson and the Johnsonites , the village 's only other gang . Adam drummed his heels on the edge of the milk crate that was doing the office of a seat , listening to this bickering with the relaxed air of a king listening to the idle chatter of his courtiers . He chewed lazily on a straw . It was a Thursday morning . The holidays stretched ahead , endless and unsullied . They needed filling up . He let the conversation float around him like the buzzing of grasshoppers or , more precisely , like a prospector watching the churning gravel for a glint of useful gold . “

42979	43036	43144	43145	my aunt	1655	” The Them gave this due consideration . They had once at Adam 's instigation - tried a health food diet for a whole afternoon . Their verdict NEIL GAIMAN AND TERRY PRATCHETT was that you could live very well on healthy food provided you had a big cooked lunch beforehand . Brian leaned forward conspiratorially . "

43070	43135	43053	43053	They	1667	” This time the consideration was more thoughtful . The Them had reached that position where , as it were , the roller coaster of Life had almost completed the long haul to the top of the first big humpback of puberty so that they could just look down into the precipitous ride ahead , full of mystery , terror , and exciting curves . “
43138	43142	43053	43053	They	1667	” said Pepper . “

43192	43197	43183	43183	She	1655	” said Wensleydale defensively . “
43229	43233	43222	43222	she	1655	" he added , “

43252	43256	43222	43222	she	1655	” said Brian . “
43286	43380	43278	43278	You	1677	" There was a lazy shifting of position on the milk crate throne . Adam was going to speak . The Them fell silent . Adam was always worth listening to . Deep in their hearts , the Them knew that they were n't a gang of four . They were a gang of three , which belonged to Adam . But if you wanted excitement , and interest , and crowded days , then every Them would prize a lowly position in Adam 's gang above leadership of any other gang anywhere . “
43392	43407	43385	43385	everyone	3880	” Adam said . The Them glanced at one another . This sounded promising . "
43414	43418	43410	43410	they	4591	” said Pepper . "

43579	43587	43557	43557	they	4591	” she added cheerfully . GOOD OMENS 95 "
43598	43607	43557	43557	they	4591	" reiterated Wensleydale , the rational thinking person . “
43633	43634	43629	43631	the Spanish Inquisition	1690	” “
43660	43697	43654	43654	we	1687	” said Brian . Mr. Pickersgill was the vicar . Currently he was in dispute with the Them over subjects ranging from climbing the yew tree in the churchyard to ringing the bells and running away . “
43713	43717	43698	43698	I	0	” said Adam . "
43727	43728	43698	43698	I	0	” "
43738	43743	43734	43734	you	0	” said Brian reassuringly . "

43779	43783	43773	43773	Picky	596	” said Pepper . “
43789	43795	43773	43773	Picky	596	” said Brian , meaningfully . “
43804	43808	43809	43809	He	596	” sniffed Pepper . "
43836	43878	43809	43809	He	596	" The Them shook their heads in disgust at the current low standards of ecclesiastical responsibility . Then the other three looked expectantly at Adam . They always looked expectantly at Adam . He was the one that had the ideas . "
43887	43891	43885	43885	ourselves	1697	” he said . “

43928	43933	43918	43919	Neighborhood Witch	1701	” said Adam coldly . "
43943	43947	43935	43935	we	1697	” said Wensleydale . “

44013	44043	44044	44044	I	0	” There was silence . It was broken by the crackling of one of the empty crisp packets that accumulated wherever Brian was sitting . They looked at him . "
44056	44086	44044	44044	I	0	” said Brian , slowly . 96 NEIL GAIMAN AND TERRY PRATCHETT Lunchtime came and went . The new Spanish Inquisition reconvened . The Head Inquisitor inspected it critically . "
44091	44095	44096	44096	You	0	” he demanded . “
44104	44112	44096	44096	You	0	” said Wensleydale , a shade defensively . “
44145	44146	44137	44139	a Spanish dancer	1708	” “
44156	44160	44149	44149	she	1655	” said Adam . "
44169	44200	44149	44149	she	1655	” said Wensleydale . Adam let it pass . The bullfight poster was everything Brian had promised . Pepper had something rather like a gravy boat made out of raffia . "
44208	44213	44214	44215	My mother	4120	” she said defiantly . “
44222	44223	44214	44215	My mother	4120	" "
44233	44238	44224	44224	It	1710	” said Adam severely . "
44245	44437	44224	44224	It	1710	” Pepper countered , moving just ever so slightly into a fighting stance . Adam hesitated . His sister Sarah and her boyfriend had also been to Spain . Sarah had returned with a very large purple toy donkey which , while definitely Spanish , did not come up to what Adam instinctively felt should be the tone of the Spanish Inquisition . The boyfriend , on the other hand , had brought back a very ornate sword which , despite its tendency to bend when picked up and go blunt when asked to cut paper , proclaimed itself to be made of Toledo steel . Adam had spent an instructive half - hour with the encyclopedia and felt that this was just what the Inquisition needed . Subtle hints had not worked , however . In the end Adam had taken a bunch of onions from the kitchen . They might well have been Spanish . But even Adam had to concede that , as decor for the Inquisitorial premises , they lacked that certain something . He was in no position to argue too vehemently about raffia wine holders . “
44441	44445	44446	44446	You	1711	” he said . "
44453	44459	44446	44446	You	1711	” said Pepper , relaxing . “
44463	44467	44446	44446	You	1711	” said Adam . "
44475	44476	44471	44471	Everyone	3880	” “
44482	44487	44477	44477	They	1712	” said Pepper doggedly . “
44494	44495	44477	44477	They	1712	" "
44501	44513	44477	44477	They	1712	” said Adam , who was getting fed up with onions . “
44573	44620	44567	44567	your	1716	” For once , Pepper did n't push it . She 'd been promised the post of Head Torturer . No one doubted who was going to be Chief Inquisitor . GOOD OMENS 97 Wensleydale and Brian were less enthralled with their roles of Inquisitorial Guards . "
44630	44656	44623	44623	you	1716	” said Adam , whose lunch hour had included ten minutes with a phrase book Sarah had bought in a haze of romanticism in Alicanté . "
44671	44687	44664	44664	you	1716	" said Wensleydale , who had also been doing some slightly more accurate lunchtime reading . "
44691	44696	44664	44664	you	1716	” said Adam firmly . "
44706	44707	44708	44708	I	0	” “

44746	44759	44760	44760	I	0	” This had been slightly bothering Adam 's patriotic sensibilities as well . “
44763	44767	44760	44760	I	0	” he said , “
44795	44799	44800	44802	the Inquisitorial Guard	1721	" he added , "
44814	44844	44800	44802	the Inquisitorial Guard	1721	” The new inhabitant of Jasmine Cottage would have to wait , they 'd decided . What they needed to do was start small and work their way up . “
44853	44859	44800	44802	the Inquisitorial Guard	1721	" said the Chief Inquisitor . “
44862	44882	44800	44802	the Inquisitorial Guard	1721	” said Pepper 's little sister , who was six and built like a small golden - haired football . “
44896	44906	44889	44889	you	1725	” hissed the Head Torturer , nudging the suspect . “
44911	44916	44889	44889	you	1725	” demanded the suspect . "
44928	44934	44935	44935	I	0	” said the Head Torturer . "
44957	44984	44996	44997	a witch	4597	” she added quickly . The little suspect gave the decor of the Inquisitorial headquarters a disparaging look . There was a decided odor of onions . "
44987	44991	44996	44997	a witch	4597	” she said . “
45025	45035	45053	45054	a witch	4597	" The Head Torturer nodded to the Chief Inquisitor . “
45038	45044	45053	45054	a witch	4597	” said Pepper , desperately , “
45077	45082	45084	45084	you	1725	” she added severely , "
45098	45110	45084	45084	you	1725	" 98 NEIL GAIMAN AND TERRY PRATCHETT The suspect considered this . “
45119	45137	45112	45112	I	0	” she wailed . The male Them exchanged exhausted glances . This was out of their league . “
45144	45148	45139	45139	you	1725	" said Pepper , “
45164	45181	45182	45182	You	1725	” she added , glaring at the other Them and daring them to make a comment . “
45187	45192	45182	45182	You	1725	” snapped her sister , "
45215	45222	45207	45207	you	1725	” Adam gave a magisterial cough . “
45231	45250	45207	45207	you	1725	” he repeated . The sister took a look at Pepper 's face , and decided not to chance “
45253	45294	45207	45207	you	1725	” she decided . It was a very good torture , everyone agreed . The trouble was getting the putative witch off it . It was a hot afternoon and the Inquisitorial guards felt that they were being put upon . "
45311	45323	45301	45302	Brother Brian	403	” said Brother Wensleydale , wiping the sweat off his brow . “
45343	45344	45339	45339	Benedictine	600	" “
45350	45457	45347	45347	we	1736	” demanded the suspect , water pouring out of her shoes . It had occurred to the Chief Inquisitor during his researches that the British Inquisition was probably not yet ready for the reintroduction of the Iron Maiden and the choke - pear . But an illustration of a medieval ducking stool suggested that it was tailor - made for the purpose . All you needed was a pond and some planks and a rope . It was the sort of combination that always attracted the Them , who never had much difficulty in finding all three . The suspect was now green to the waist . “
45465	45469	45347	45347	we	1736	” she said . “
45471	45472	45473	45473	I	0	” "

45517	45557	45496	45497	evil witches	1738	” said the Chief Inquisitor sternly , but without much real feeling . It was a hot afternoon , the Inquisitorial robes of old sacking were scratchy and smelled of stale barley , and the pond looked astonishingly inviting . “
45564	45574	45575	45575	You	1740	” he said , and turned to the suspect . “
45580	45623	45624	45624	he	0	“ Do n't sendured for inquisitors to be lind It was a hot after GOOD OMENS witch , all right , do n't do it again , and now you get off and let someone else have a turn . Oh lay , ”
45627	45632	45634	45634	Pepper	402	“ What happens now ? ”
45774	45787	45788	45788	Adam	401	“ I do n't see why we should have a hosepipe ban , ”
45796	45857	45790	45791	Mr. Young	399	“ I pay my rates like everyone else . The garden looks like the Sahara desert . I 'm surprised there was any water left in the pond . I blame it on the lack of nuclear testing , myself . You used to get proper summers when I was a boy . It used to rain all the time . ”
45939	45970	45971	45971	he	401	" Serve everyone right if the witches took over the whole country and made everyone eat health food and not go to church and dance around with no clothes on , ”

46345	46367	46369	46369	Adam	401	" They just better not come running to me when ole Picky is turned into a frog , that 's all , "
46530	46533	46534	46534	he	401	“ Hallo , ”
46655	46660	46661	46661	she	444	“ Who ’re you ? ”
46664	46670	46672	46672	Adam	401	" I 'm Adam Young , ”

46706	46723	46724	46724	she	444	“ Mrs. Henderson said I was to be sure to keep an eye out for you , ”
46728	46736	46738	46738	Adam	401	“ I 'm well known around here , ”
46740	46749	46751	46751	Anathema	444	“ She said you were born to hang , ”
46771	46784	46786	46786	Anathema	444	“ She said you were the worst of the lot of Them , ”
46797	46829	46830	46830	she	444	“ She said , ' You watch out for Them , Miss , they 're nothing but a pack of ringleaders . That young Adam 's full of the Old Adam , ”
46833	46842	46844	46844	Adam	401	" What 've you been cryin ' for ? ”
46847	46858	46860	46860	Anathema	444	“ Oh ? Oh , I 've just lost something , ”
46862	46866	46860	46860	Anathema	444	“ A book . ”

46885	46932	46882	46882	Adam	401	" I know quite a lot about books , actually . I wrote a book once . It was a triffic book . It was nearly eight pages long . It was about this pirate who was a famous detective . And I drew the pictures . ”
46945	47018	46942	46942	he	401	" If you like I 'll let you read it . I bet it was a lot more excitin ' than any book you 've lost . ' Specially the bit in the spaceship where the dinosaur comes out and fights with the cowboys . I bet it 'd cheer you up , my book . It cheered up Brian no end . He said he 'd never been so cheered up . "
47019	47034	47035	47035	she	1759	“ Thank you , I 'm sure your book is a very good book , ”
47044	47066	47067	47067	She	1759	“ But I do n't need you to help look for my book - I think it 's too late now . ”
47073	47083	47084	47084	she	1759	“ I expect you know this area very well ? ”
47087	47094	47096	47096	Adam	401	" For miles an ' miles , ”

47115	47121	47123	47123	Adam	401	“ Did they steal it ? ”
47146	47195	47196	47196	She	1759	“ Not really . Sort of . I mean , they did n't mean to . They were looking for the Manor , but I went up there today and no one knows anything about them . There was some sort of accident or something , I believe . ”
47247	47254	47256	47256	Adam	401	“ What 's the book called ? ”
47258	47270	47272	47272	Anathema	444	" The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter , Witch , ”
47274	47278	47272	47272	Anathema	444	“ Which what ? ”
47279	47288	47290	47290	Anathema	444	" No . Witch . Like in Macbeth , ”
47292	47297	47299	47299	Adam	401	“ I saw that , ”
47301	47322	47299	47299	Adam	401	“ It was really interesting , the way them kings carried on . Gosh . What 's nice about 'em ? ”
47323	47336	47349	47349	You	1761	“ Nice used to mean , well , precise . Or exact . "
47590	47593	47595	47595	Adam	401	" Wicked ! ”
47616	47632	47595	47595	Adam	401	“ It tells you who 's going to win the Grand National , does it ? ”

47893	47896	47870	47870	Anathema	444	“ Yes ? ”
47897	47919	47870	47870	Anathema	444	" You were thinking ' Nothin' wrong with my eyes , they do n't need examining , ' were n't you ? ”

51836	51878	51833	51833	Wensleydale	599	“ because I 've read about the Mary Celeste , and there was no one on it . It 's famous for having no one on it . They found it floating around all by itself with no one on it . ”
51879	51895	51897	51897	Adam	401	" I din't say he was on it when they found it , did I ? ”
51900	51927	51897	51897	Adam	401	“ Course he was n't on it . 'Cos of the UFOs landin ' and takin ' him off . I thought everyone knew about that . ”

52206	52246	52204	52204	Adam	401	“ But now it 's different . They all have this bright blue light around 'em and go around doing good . Sort of g’lactic policemen , going round tellin ' everyone to live in universal harmony and stuff . ”
52263	52270	52272	52272	Brian	403	“ What I 've always wondered , ”
52274	52299	52272	52272	Brian	403	“ is why they call 'em UFOs when they know they 're flying saucers . I mean , they 're Identified Flying Objects then . ”
52300	52311	52313	52313	Adam	401	" It 's 'cos the goverment hushes it all up , ”
52315	52333	52313	52313	Adam	401	“ Millions of flying saucers landin ' all the time and the goverment keeps hushing it up . ”
52334	52337	52339	52339	Wensleydale	599	“ Why ? "
52386	52393	52395	52395	Adam	401	“ 'Cos they 're the goverment , ”
52398	52466	52395	52395	Adam	401	“ That 's what goverments do . They 've got this great big building in London full of books of all the things they 've hushed up . When the Prime Minister gets in to work in the morning , the first thing he does is go through the big list of everything that 's happened in the night and put this big red stamp on them . ”
52467	52484	52486	52486	Wensleydale	599	“ I bet he has a cup of tea first , and then reads the paper , "
52512	52523	52506	52506	he	599	“ And talks about what was on TV last night . ”
52524	52542	52395	52395	Adam	401	" Well , orlright , but after that he gets out the book and the big stamp . ”
52543	52552	52554	52554	Pepper	402	" Which says ' Hush It Up , ' "
52556	52562	52564	52564	Adam	401	" It says Top Secret , ”
52573	52602	52564	52564	Adam	401	" It 's like nucular power stations . They keep blowin ' up all the time but no one ever finds out 'cos the goverment hushes it up . ”
52603	52613	52615	52615	Wensleydale	599	“ They do n't keep blowing all the time , ”
52618	52662	52615	52615	Wensleydale	599	" My father says they 're dead safe and mean we do n't have to live in a greenhouse . Anyway , there 's a big picture of one in my comic * and it does n't say anything about it blowing up . "
52663	52666	52668	52668	Brian	403	“ Yes , "
52670	52688	52668	52668	Brian	403	“ But you lent me that comic afterwards and I know what type of picture it was . ”
52704	52713	52689	52689	Wensleydale	599	“ Brian , just because it says Exploded Diagram "
52721	52724	52726	52726	Adam	401	“ Look , ”
52729	52745	52726	52726	Adam	401	" Do you want me to tell you about the Aquarium Age , or not ? ”
52762	52765	52767	52767	Adam	401	“ Right , ”
52774	52787	52788	52788	he	401	“ Now you 've made me forget where I 've got to , ”
52791	52796	52798	52798	Brian	403	“ Flyin ' saucers , ”
52800	52874	52798	52798	Brian	403	“ Right . Right . Well , if you do see a flying UFO , these goverment * Wensleydale 's alleged comic was a 94 - week part - work called Wonders of Nature and Science . He had every single one so far , and had asked for a set of binders for his birthday . Brian 's weekly reading was anything with a lot of exclamation marks in the title , like “
52878	52880	52798	52798	Brian	403	” or “
52884	52951	52953	52953	Adam	401	” So was Pepper 's , although even under the most refined of tortures she still would n't admit to the fact that she also bought Just Seventeen under plain covers . Adam did n't read any comics at all . They never lived up to the kind of things he could do in his head . GOOD OMENS 117 men come and tell you off , ”
52961	52976	52953	52953	Adam	401	" In a big black car . It happens all the time in America . "
53022	53028	53030	53030	Adam	401	" Prob’ly causes traffic jams , ”
53032	53067	53030	53030	Adam	401	" all these men in black cars , going about telling people off for seeing UFOs . They tell you that if you go on seeing 'em , you 'll have a Nasty Accident . ”
53068	53079	53081	53081	Brian	403	“ Prob’ly get run over by a big black car , ”
53096	53101	53102	53102	he	403	“ Do you know , ”
53105	53126	53102	53102	he	403	“ my cousin said that in America there 's shops that sell thirty - nine different flavors of ice cream ? ”
53134	53146	53148	53148	Pepper	402	“ There are n't thirty - nine flavors of ice cream , ”
53150	53163	53148	53148	Pepper	402	“ There are n't thirty - nine flavors in the whole world . ”
53164	53175	53177	53177	Wensleydale	599	“ There could be , if you mixed them up , ”
53182	53194	53195	53195	He	403	“ You know . Strawberry and chocolate . Chocolate and vanilla . ”
53202	53209	53210	53210	he	403	“ Strawberry and vanilla and chocolate , ”
53215	53222	53224	53224	Adam	401	" And then there 's Atlantis , ”
53268	53278	53280	53280	Brian	403	“ Did it just happen sudden , or slowly ? ”
53282	53290	53292	53292	Adam	401	“ Sort of sudden an ' slowly , ”
53294	53326	53292	53292	Adam	401	“ 'cos a lot of 'em got away in boats to all the other countries and taught 'em how to do maths an ' English an ' History an ' stuff . ”
53327	53338	53340	53340	Pepper	402	" Do n't see what 's so great about that , ”
53342	53354	53356	53356	Brian	403	" Could of been good fun , when it was sinking , ”
53370	53389	53356	53356	Brian	403	“ People deliverin ' the milk and newspapers by boat , no one having to go to school . "
53390	53402	53404	53404	Wensleydale	599	" If I was an Atlantisan , I 'd of stayed , ”
53418	53452	53414	53414	he	599	" You 'd just have to wear a diver 's helmet , that 's all . And nail all the windows shut and fill the houses with air . It would be great . ”
53481	53487	53488	53488	he	401	“ They could of done , ”
53494	53517	53488	53488	he	401	“ After they 'd sent all the teachers off in the boats . Maybe everyone else stayed on when it went down . "
53524	53532	53534	53534	Brian	403	“ You would n't have to wash , "
53570	53622	53568	53568	Brian	403	“ Because everything would stay clean . An ' , an ' you could grow seaweed and stuff in the garden and shoot sharks . And have pet octopuses and stuff . And there would n't be any schools and stuff because they 'd of got rid of all the teachers . ”
53623	53632	53634	53634	Pepper	402	“ They could still be down there now , ”

54551	54558	54548	54549	the spokesman	1961	“ Not escaped . Temporarily mislaid . ”
54559	54569	54605	54606	the spokesman	1961	" You mean it is still on the premises ? ”
54570	54585	54587	54588	the spokesman	1961	“ We certainly can not see how it could have been removed from them , ”
54590	54598	54587	54588	the spokesman	1961	" Surely you have considered terrorist activity ? ”
54631	54714	54605	54606	the spokesman	1961	“ Yes , I suppose we must . All we need to do is find some terrorists who are capable of taking an entire nuclear reactor out of its can while it 's running and without anyone noticing . It weighs about a thousand tons and is forty feet high . So they 'll be quite strong terrorists . Perhaps you 'd like to ring them up , sir , and ask them questions in that supercilious , accusatory way of yours . ”
54715	54727	54729	54730	the interviewer	1960	“ But you said the power station is still producing electricity , ”
54732	54736	54605	54606	the spokesman	1961	“ It is . "
54737	54753	54757	54758	the spokesman	1961	“ How can it still be doing that if it has n't got any reactors ? ”

55568	55633	55566	55566	Adam	401	“ No one said it was hollow all the way through . It prob’ly goes down miles and miles to make room for all the lather and oil and coal and Tibetan tunnels and suchlike . But then it 's hollow after that . That 's what people think . And there 's a hole at the North Pole to let the air in . ”
55634	55642	55644	55644	Wensleydale	599	“ Never seen it on an atlas , "

55731	55740	55741	55741	They	1991	“ It 's amazing . You know Tibet ? ”
55783	55798	55799	55799	They	1991	" Well , you know all those teachers that left Atlantis when it sunk ? ”
55803	55880	55881	55881	he	1995	" Well , some of them went to Tibet and now they run the world . They 're called the Secret Masters . On account of being teachers , I suppose . An ' they 've got this secret underground city called Shambala and tunnels that go all over the world so 's they know everythin ' that goes on and control everythin ' .

He also had a huge pile of newspapers . 128 NEIL GAIMAN AND TERRY PRATCHETT If he had known that army life consisted chiefly of applying the one to the other , he used to muse , he would never have joined . Witchfinder Sergeant Shadwell had made him a list , which was taped to the wall in Shadwell 's tiny crowded flat situated over Rajit 's Newsagents and Video Rental . The list read : 1 ) Witches . 2 ) Unexplainable Phenomenons . Phenomenatrices . Phenomenice . Things , ye ken well what I mean . Newt was looking for either . He signed and picked up another newspaper , scanned the front page , opened it , ignored page two ( never anything on there ) then blushed crimson as he performed the obligatory nipple count on page three . Shadwell had been insistent about this . “

They claimed to lead the largest coven in Saffron Walden , and to restore sexual potency by the use of small and very phallic dolls . The newspaper was offering ten of the dolls to readers who were prepared to write “
58564	58599	58486	58486	them	2055	” stories . Newt cut the story out and stuck it into a scrapbook . There was a muffled thumping on the door . Newt opened it ; a pile of newspapers stood there . “

Certainly Mr. Rajit worked on the Sabbath . In fact , with his plump quiet wife and plump cheerful children he worked around the clock , never mind the calendar , diligently filling the area 's needs in the matter of soft GOOD OMENS 129 drinks , white bread , tobacco , sweets , newspapers , magazines , and the type of top - shelf pornography that made Newt 's eyes water just to think about . The worst you could imagine Mr. Rajit doing with a chicken was selling it after the “

67622	67626	67596	67596	I	0	" it said . "
67648	67657	67645	67645	I	0	” The alien exchanged glances with its colleague . “

67773	67832	67765	67765	sir	955	” said Newt . He was wondering who he could tell about this , and realizing that there was absolutely no one who would believe him . The toad bent closer . It seemed to be worried about something , insofar as Newt was any judge of the expressions of an alien race he 'd never encountered before . "
67843	67847	67841	67841	sir	955	" Newt gabbled . “
67883	67884	67868	67868	I	0	” “

67975	67983	67958	67958	you	955	” said the toad . Newt brightened . “

68041	68069	68071	68071	you	0	” It shook its head vaguely , turned around and waddled back to the saucer without another word . Newt stuck his head out of the window . “
68073	68082	68071	68071	you	0	" The small alien walked past the car . “
68090	68100	68071	68071	you	0	” it rasped , giving him a meaningful look . “
68134	68236	68237	68237	he	2345	” The two of them righted the third alien , dragged it back up the ramp , and shut the door . Newt waited for a while , in case there were any spectacular light displays , but it just stood there . Eventually he drove up on the verge and around it . When he looked in his rear - view mirror it had gone . I must be overdoing something , he thought guiltily . But what ? And I ca n't even tell Shadwell , because he 'd probably bawl me out for not counting their nipples . , "
68242	68245	68247	68247	Adam	401	" Anyway , ”
68249	68259	68247	68247	Adam	401	“ you 've got it all wrong about witches . "

68303	68325	68294	68294	he	2345	“ Actually , they 've been right all along and it 's wrong to persecute 'em with British Inquisitions and stuff . ”
68326	68355	68357	68357	Pepper	402	“ My mother said they were just intelligent women protesting in the only way open to them against the stifling injustices of a male - dominated social hierarchy , "
68368	68381	68383	68383	Adam	401	“ Yes , but your mother 's always saying things like that , ”
68393	68412	68389	68389	Pepper	402	“ And she said , at worst they were just free - thinking worshippers of the progenerative principle . ”
68413	68420	68422	68422	Wensleydale	599	“ Who 's the progenratty principle ? ”
68424	68436	68438	68438	Pepper	402	" Dunno . Something to do with maypoles , I think , ”
68441	68451	68453	68453	Brian	403	“ Well , I thought they worshipped the Devil , ”
68483	68495	68474	68475	The Them	594	“ Anyway , the Devil'd be better than a stupid maypole . "
68496	68504	68506	68506	Adam	401	" That 's where you 're wrong , ”
68508	68526	68506	68506	Adam	401	“ It 's not the Devil . It 's another god , or something . With horns . "
68527	68531	68533	68533	Brian	403	“ The Devil , ”
68535	68538	68540	68540	Adam	401	" No , "

68596	68600	68602	68602	Wensleydale	599	" Which half ? ”
68609	68614	68615	68615	he	401	" The bottom half , ”
68620	68636	68615	68615	he	401	“ Fancy you not knowin ' that . I should of thought everyone knew that . "
68637	68646	68648	68648	Wensleydale	599	" Goats have n't got a bottom half , ”
68650	68666	68648	68648	Wensleydale	599	" They 've got a front half and a back half . Just like cows . "
68691	68712	68688	68688	Pepper	402	" If he 's got goat legs , he should n't have horns . They belong to the front half . ”
68713	68724	68726	68726	Adam	401	" I did n't make him up , did I ? ”
68730	68755	68726	68726	Adam	401	“ I was just telling you . It 's news to me I made him up . No need to go on at me . "
68756	68759	68761	68761	Pepper	402	" Anyway , ”
68763	68799	68761	68761	Pepper	402	“ This stupid Pot ca n't go around complaining if people think he 's the Devil . Not with having horns on . People are bound to say , oh , here comes the Devil . ”
68826	68838	68839	68839	he	401	“ You do n't have to be so litral about everything , ”
68842	68892	68839	68839	he	401	“ That 's the trouble these days . Grass materialism . 's people like you who go round choppin ' down rain forests and makin ' holes in the ozone layer . There 's a great big hole in the ozone layer 'cos of grass materialism people like you . ”
68893	68903	68905	68905	Brian	403	“ I ca n't do anythin ' about it , ”

68921	68928	68930	68930	Adam	401	" It 's in the magazine , ”

69034	69042	69044	69044	Wensleydale	599	“ There was this program about them , ”
69046	69056	69058	69058	Adam	401	“ What 've we got to save 'em for ? ”
69083	69122	69076	69076	Wensleydale	599	“ Because they can sing . And they 've got big brains . There 's hardly any of them left . And we do n't need to kill them anyway 'cos they only make pet food and stuff . ”
69123	69130	69132	69132	Brian	403	" If they 're so clever , "
69136	69145	69132	69132	Brian	403	" what are they doin' in the sea ? ”
69146	69152	69154	69154	Adam	401	" Oh , I dunno , ”
69159	69187	69154	69154	Adam	401	“ Swimmin ' around 152 NEIL GAIMAN AND TERRY PRATCHETT all day , just openin ' their mouths and eating stuff ... sounds pretty clever to me , ”
69307	69314	69315	69315	he	401	" We should n't move him , ”
69318	69330	69315	69315	he	401	“ Because of broken bones . We ought to get someone . ”
69846	69853	69841	69841	her	2379	“ How are we feeling now ? ”
70001	70011	70030	70030	Newt	653	" You banged your head on the steering wheel , ”
70020	70029	70030	70030	Newt	653	“ Nothing broken , though . What happened ? ”
70036	70041	70042	70042	he	653	“ Car all right ? ”
70045	70063	70042	70042	he	653	“ Apparently . A little voice inside it keeps repeating ‘ Prease to frasten sleat - bert . "
70064	70065	70030	70030	Newt	653	" “
70068	70077	70078	70078	They	2384	” said Newt , to an invisible audience . "
70096	70102	70103	70103	I	0	” He blinked at Anathema . “
70113	70117	70103	70103	I	0	” he said . “
70134	70204	70128	70128	I	0	” The figure walked around into his line of sight . It had dark hair , and red lips , and green eyes , and it was almost certainly female . Newt tried * Actually , less so when he took off his glasses , because then he tripped over things and wore bandages a lot . 154 NEIL GAIMAN AND TERRY PRATCHETT not to stare . It said , "
70216	70221	70128	70128	I	0	” Then she smiled . “
70234	70235	70230	70231	a witchfinder	2387	” “
70238	70249	70230	70231	a witchfinder	2387	" Newt began . She held up his open wallet . “
70256	70332	70250	70250	I	0	” she said . Newt felt extremely embarrassed , a not unusual state of affairs . Shadwell had given him an official witchfinder 's warrant card , which among other things charged all beadles , magistrates , bishops , and bailiffs to give him free passage and as much dry kindling as he required . It was incredibly impressive , a masterpiece of calligraphy , and probably quite old . He 'd forgotten about it . "
70340	70345	70346	70346	I	0	” he said wretchedly . "
70354	70377	70378	70380	a computer engineer	2389	” he was n't going to say wages clerk , not here , not now , not to a girl like this , “
70382	70414	70378	70380	a computer engineer	2389	" he lied . Want to be , want to be ; in my heart I 'm a computer engineer , it 's only the brain that 's letting me down . “
70422	70424	70378	70380	a computer engineer	2389	” . “
70428	70432	70425	70426	Anathema Device	444	” said Anathema . "
70461	70473	70454	70454	You	2392	” she added , handing him a small sheet of cardboard , “
70489	70693	70695	70695	you	2392	” Newt did in fact own a small home computer , despite his boyhood experiences . In fact , he 'd owned several . You always knew which ones he owned . They were desktop equivalents of the Wasabi . They were the ones which , for example , dropped to half - price just after he 'd bought them . Or were launched in a blaze of publicity and disappeared into obscurity within a year . Or only worked at all if you stuck them in a fridge . Or , if by some fluke they were basically good machines , Newt always got the few that were sold with the early , bug - infested version of the operating system . But he persevered , because he believed . Adam also had a small computer . He used it for playing games , but never for very long . He 'd load a game , watch it intently for a few minutes , and then proceed to play it until the High Score counter ran out of zeroes . When the other Them wondered about this strange skill , Adam professed mild amazement that everyone did n't play games like this . “
70713	70848	70695	70695	you	2392	" he said . Quite a lot of the front parlor in Jasmine Cottage was taken up , Newt noticed with a sinking feeling , with piles of newspapers . Clippings GOOD OMENS 155 were stuck around the walls . Some of them had bits circled in red ink . He was mildly gratified to spot several he had cut out for Shadwell . Anathema owned very little in the way of furniture . The only thing she 'd bothered to bring with her had been her clock , one of the family heirlooms . It was n't a full - cased grandfather clock , but a wall clock with a free - swinging pendulum that E. A. Poe would cheerfully have strapped someone under . Newt kept finding his eye drawn to it . "

71115	71364	71110	71110	You	2392	” said Anathema sweetly . Newt stared back at the card she 'd handed him . She 'd seemed to think it would explain everything . It did n't . It had a ruled line down the middle . On the left - hand side was a short piece of what seemed to be poetry , in black ink . On the right - hand side , in red ink this time , were comments and annotations . The effect was as follows : 3819 : When Orient 's chariot inverted be , four wheles in the skye , a man Japanese car ? Upturned .

71806	71820	71821	71821	She	391	” Newt stared at the prophecy again . His mouth opened and shut . “
71829	71833	71821	71821	She	391	" he said . “
71874	72060	71861	71861	she	391	" Sost psychic abilities are caused by a simple lack of temporal focus , and the mind of Agnes Nutter was so far adrift in Time that she was considered pretty mad even by the standards of seventeenthcentury Lancashire , where mad prophetesses were a growth industry . But she was a treat to listen to , everyone agreed . She used to go on about curing illnesses by using a sort of mold , and the importance of washing your hands so that the tiny little animals who caused diseases would be washed away , when every sensible person knew that a good stink was the only defense against the demons of ill health . She advocated running at a sort of gentle bouncing trot as an aid to living longer , which was extremely suspicious and first put the Witchfinders onto her , and stressed the importance of fiber in diet , although here she was clearly ahead of her time since most people were less bothered about the fiber in their diet than the gravel . And she would n't cure warts . "
72069	72074	71861	71861	she	391	” she 'd say , "
72085	72122	71861	71861	she	391	” It was obvious that Agnes had a line to the Future , but it was an unusually narrow and specific line . In other words , almost totally useless . 158 NEIL GAIMAN AND TERRY PRATCHETT “

72489	72604	72483	72483	She	444	“ You see , what no one ever realized until about two hundred years ago that The Nice and Accurate Prophecies was Agnes 's idea of a family heirloom . Many of the prophecies relate to her descendants and their well - being . She was sort of trying to look after us after she 'd gone . That 's the reason for the King 's Lynn prophecy , we think . My father was visiting there at the time , so from Agnes 's point of view , while he was unlikely to be struck by stray rounds from Dallas , there was a good chance he might be hit by a brick . ”
72605	72611	72613	72613	Newt	653	“ What a nice person , ”
72615	72627	72613	72613	Newt	653	“ You could almost overlook her blowing up an entire village . ”

72644	72691	72641	72641	she	444	" Ever GOOD OMENS 159 since then we 've made it our job to interpret them . After all , it averages out at about one prophecy a month - more now , in fact , as we get closer to the end of the world . ”
72692	72701	72703	72703	Newt	653	" And when is that going to be ? ”
72753	72764	72766	72766	Anathema	444	“ Think yourself lucky I do n't need a stopwatch , ”
72768	72781	72766	72766	Anathema	444	“ We 've got , oh , about five or six hours . ”
72817	72826	72827	72827	he	653	“ Do witches keep drink in the house ? ”
72830	72835	72827	72827	he	653	" Oh , yes . ”
72855	72873	72836	72836	She	444	" Green bubbly stuff with strange Things squirming on the congealing surface . You should know that . ”
72874	72881	72836	72836	She	444	" Fine . Got any ice ? ”
72919	72936	72937	72937	Newt	653	“ Did I tell you about the Tibetan coming out of a hole in the road ? ”
72944	72952	72953	72953	she	444	“ Oh , I know about them , ”
72963	73017	72953	72953	she	444	“ The two of them came out of the front lawn yesterday . The poor things were quite bewildered , so I gave them a cup of tea and then they borrowed a spade and went down again . I do n't think they quite know what they 're supposed to be doing . ”
73023	73032	73033	73033	he	653	" How did you know they were Tibetan ? ”
73036	73059	73033	73033	he	653	" If it comes to that , how did you know ? Did he go ' Ommm ' when you hit him ? ”
73060	73068	73070	73070	Newt	653	“ Well , he he looked Tibetan , ”
73072	73088	73070	73070	Newt	653	“ Saffron robes , bald head . . . you know . . . Tibetan . ”
73089	73130	73033	73033	he	653	" One of mine spoke quite good English . It seems that one minute he was repairing radios in Lhasa , next minute he was in a tunnel . He does n't know how he 's going to get home . ”
73131	73153	73155	73155	Newt	653	“ If you 'd sent him up the road , he could probably have got a lift on a flying saucer , "
73158	73170	73155	73155	Newt	653	“ Three aliens ? One of them a little tin robot ? ”
73171	73182	73033	73033	he	653	“ They landed on your lawn too , did they ? ”
73203	73241	73155	73155	Newt	653	" It 's about the only place they did n't land , according to the radio . They keep coming down all over the world delivering a short trite message of cosmic peace , and when people say “

73413	73437	73407	73407	she	391	” Anathema glowered at him . If looks could kill , Newt would have been on a slab . Then she went on : “

74071	74087	74068	74069	The Laurels	709	” Adam flicked a pebble into the hole . He was becoming bored with Tibetans . “

74295	74322	74254	74254	They	2442	" He stared at Dog . He was feeling very odd . The little mongrel , noticing the attention , balanced expectantly on its hind legs . “
74334	74339	74326	74326	you	2447	” said Adam severely . "
74353	74378	74326	74326	you	2447	” Dog , one last tiny satanic spark of his soul hating himself for it , put his head on one side and whined . “

74435	74580	74418	74419	the Atlantisans'd	711	” said Adam , not really listening . Something was happening inside his head . It was aching . Thoughts were arriving there without him having to think them . Something was saying , You can do something , Adam Young . You can make it all better . You can do anything you want . And what was saying this to him was . . . him . Part of him , deep down . Part of him that had been attached to him all these years and not really noticed , like a shadow . It was saying : yes , it 's a rotten world . It could have been great . But now it 's rotten , and it 's time to do something about it . That 's what you 're here for . To make it all better . "
74590	74601	74602	74603	The Atlantisans	645	” Pepper went on , giving him a worried look . “

74710	74742	74783	74783	you	2456	” This was n't the old Adam the Them knew . The Them avoided one another 's faces . With Adam in this mood , the world seemed a chillier place . “
74747	74753	74783	74783	you	2456	” said Brian , pragmatically , "

74863	74905	74824	74824	they	2461	” The Them exchanged glances . There was a shadow over the whole world . Storm clouds were building up in the north , the sunlight glowing yellow off them as though the sky had been painted by an enthusiastic amateur . “
74921	74973	74824	74824	they	2461	” said Adam . That had n't sounded like Adam 's voice . A bitter wind blew through the summer woods . Adam looked at Dog , who tried to stand on his head . There was a distant mutter of thunder . He reached down and patted the dog absentmindedly . "
74994	74998	74824	74824	they	2461	” said Adam . “
75021	75088	75014	75014	we	2463	” The thunder growled again . Pepper shivered . This was n't the normal Them mobius bickering , which passed many a slow hour . There was a look in Adam 's eye that his friend could n't quite fathom - not devilment , because that was more or less there all the time , but a sort of blank grayness that was far worse . . "

75577	75603	75666	75666	It	2478	" The clouds spread forwards and sideways like ink poured into a bowl of clear water , moving across the sky faster than the wind . “
75611	75630	75666	75666	It	2478	” Wensleydale shrieked . Adam was n't listening , at least to any voices outside his own head . "
75640	75644	75645	75645	We	2477	” he said . “

Be professional , he told himself . You 're a soldier , are n't you ? Well , GOOD OMENS 165 practically . Then act like a soldier . He thought hard for a fraction of a second . Well , act like a respectable soldier on his best behavior , then . He forced his attention back to the matter at hand . “

76014	76382	76383	76383	I	0	” He glanced at her notebooks . There was definitely something odd about the place , even if you ignored Tibetans and UFOs , which seemed to be infesting the whole world these days . The Tadfield area did n't only have the kind of weather you could set your calendar by , it was also remarkably resistant to change . No one seemed to build new houses there . The population did n't seem to move much . There seemed to be more woods and hedges than you 'd normally expect these days . The only battery farm to open in the area had failed after a year or two , and been replaced by an old - fashioned pig farmer who let his pigs run loose in his apple orchards and sold the pork at premium prices . The two local schools seemed to soldier on in blissful immunity from the changing fashions of education . A motorway which should have turned most of Lower Tadfield into little more than the Junction 18 Happy Porker Rest Area changed course five miles away , detoured in a great semicircle , and continued on its way oblivious to the little island of rural changelessness it had avoided . No one quite seemed to know why ; one of the surveyors involved had a nervous breakdown , a second had become a monk , and a third had gone off to Bali to paint nude women . It was as if a large part of the twentieth century had marked a few square miles Out of Bounds . Anathema pulled another card out of her index and flicked it across the table . 2315 .

And admittedly there seemed to be a lot of strange stuff going on , but if he really tried , poling the boat of common sense upstream against the raging current of the evidence , he could pretend it was all , well , weather balloons , or Venus , or mass hallucination . In short , whatever Newt was now thinking with , it was n't his brain . “

84499	84512	84495	84495	she	2710	“ He went down to Tadfield this morning . On a mission . "
84521	84532	84533	84533	he	742	" I got her bloody smile right in the roughs , ”
84545	84606	84533	84533	he	742	" but it went all over the place when I painted it . Her husband had a few things to say about it when I delivered it , but , like I tell him , Signor del Giocondo , apart from you , who 's going to see it ? Anyway ... explain this helicopter thing again , will you ? ”
84610	84617	84618	84618	Crowley	383	" I 'll speak to anyone , ”
84622	84630	84631	84631	she	2713	“ I 'll tell Mr. Shadwell that , ”
84635	84713	84631	84631	she	2713	“ when he gets back . Now if you do n't mind , it 's one of my mornings , and I ca n't leave my gentleman like that for long or he 'll catch his death . And at two I 've got Mrs. Ormerod and Mr. Scroggie and young Julia coming over for a sitting , and there 's the place to clean and all beforehand . But I 'll give Mr. Shadwell your message . ”
84781	84787	84789	84791	a worried newscaster	2714	" Reports are coming in , "
84793	84854	84789	84791	a worried newscaster	2714	" uh , reports are , well , nobody seems to know what 's going on , but reports available to us would seem to , uh , indicate an increase in international tensions that would have undoubtedly been viewed as impossible this time last week when , er , everyone seemed to be getting on so nicely . Er . "
84855	84878	84789	84791	a worried newscaster	2714	“ This would seem at least partly due to the spate of unusual events which have occurred over the last few days . “
84884	84887	84789	84791	a worried newscaster	2714	” CROWLEY ? “
84890	84910	84789	84791	a worried newscaster	2714	” admitted Crowley . WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON , CROWLEY ? WHAT EXACTLY HAVE YOU BEEN DOING ? "
84916	84964	84913	84913	you	2716	” Crowley asked , although he already knew . THE BOY CALLED WARLOCK . WE HAVE BROUGHT HIM TO THE FIELDS OF MEGGIDO . THE DOG IS NOT WITH HIM . THE CHILD KNOWS NOTHING OF THE GREAT WAR . HE IS NOT OUR MASTER 'S SON . "
84967	85035	84913	84913	you	2716	” said Crowley . IS THAT ALL YOU CAN SAY , CROWLEY ? OUR TROOPS ARE ASSEMBLED , THE FOUR BEASTS HAVE BEGUN TO RIDE - BUT WHERE ARE THEY RIDING TO ? SOMETHING HAS GONE WRONG , CROWLEY . AND IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY . AND , IN ALL PROBABILITY , YOUR FAULT . WE TRUST YOU HAVE A PERFECTLY REASONABLE EXPLANATION FOR ALL THIS . ... "
85039	85045	84913	84913	you	2716	” agreed Crowley , readily . "
85049	85644	84913	84913	you	2716	” ... BECAUSE YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE YOUR CHANCE TO EXPLAIN IT ALL TO US . YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE ALL THE TIME The * He was very proud of his collection . It had taken him ages to put together . This was real Soul music . James Brown was n't in it . re ason to this . It has taken kim age to put together . This was me 184 NEIL GAIMAN AND TERRY PRATCHETT THERE IS TO EXPLAIN . AND WE WILL LISTEN WITH GREAT INTEREST TO EVERYTHING YOU HAVE TO SAY . AND YOUR CONVERSATION , AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WILL ACCOMPANY IT , WILL PROVIDE A SOURCE OF ENTERTAINMENT AND PLEASURE FOR ALL THE DAMNED OF HELL , CROWLEY , BECAUSE NO MATTER HOW RACKED WITH TORMENT , NO MAT . TER WHAT AGONIES THE LOWEST OF THE DAMNED ARE SUFFERING , CROWLEY , YOU WILL HAVE IT WORSEWith a gesture , Crowley turned the set off . The dull gray - green screen continued enunciating ; the silence formed itself into words . DO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT TRYING TO ESCAPE US , CROWLEY . THERE IS NO ESCAPE . STAY WHERE YOU ARE . YOU WILL BE ... COLLECTED ... Crowley went to the window and looked out . Something black and car - shaped was moving slowly down the street toward him . It was carshaped enough to fool the casual observer . Crowley , who was observing very carefully , noticed that not only were the wheels not going round , but they were n't even attached to the car . It was slowing down as it passed each house ; Crowley assumed that the car 's passengers ( neither of them would be driving ; neither of them knew how ) were peering out at the house numbers . He had a little time . Crowley went into the kitchen , and got a plastic bucket from under the sink . Then he went back into the lounge . The Infernal Authorities had ceased communicating . Crowley turned the television to the wall , just in case . , He walked over to the Mona Lisa . Crowley lifted the picture down from the wall , revealing a safe . It was not a wall safe ; it had been bought from a company that specialized in servicing the nuclear industry . He unlocked it , revealing an inner door with a dial tumble lock . He spun the dial ( 4 - 0 - 0 - 4 was the code , easy to remember , the year he had slithered onto this stupid , marvelous planet , back when it was gleaming and new ) . Inside the safe were a thermos flask , two heavy PVC gloves , of the kind that covered one 's entire arms , and some tongs . Crowley paused . He eyed the flask nervously . ( There was a crash from downstairs . That had been the front door ... ) He pulled on the gloves and gingerly took the flask , and the tongs , and the bucket - and , as an afterthought , he grabbed the plant mister from beside a luxuriant rubber plant — and headed for his office , walking like a GOOD OMENS 185 man carrying a thermos flask full of something that might cause , if he dropped it or even thought about dropping it , the sort of explosion that impels graybeards to make statements like "
85663	85896	84913	84913	you	2716	” in SF B - movies . He reached his office , nudged open the door with his shoulder . Then he bent his legs , and slowly put things down on the floor . Bucket ... tongs . . . plant mister ... and finally , deliberately , the flask . A bead of sweat began to form on Crowley 's forehead , and trickled down into one eye . He flicked it away . Then , with care and deliberation , he used the tongs to unscrew the top of the flask ... carefully ... carefully ... that was it ... ( A pounding on the stairs below him , and a muffled scream . That would have been the little old lady on the floor below . ) He could not afford to rush . He gripped the flask with the tongs , and taking care not to spill the tiniest drop , he poured the contents into the plastic bucket . One false move was all it would take . There . Then he opened the office door about six inches , and placed the bucket on top . He used the tongs to replace the top of the flask , then ( -a crash from his outer hallway- ) pulled off the PVC gloves , picked up the plant mister , and settled himself behind his desk . “
85900	85908	85909	85909	He	2719	” called a guttural voice . Hastur . "
85914	85919	85909	85909	He	2719	” hissed another voice . “
85928	86093	85923	85926	the slimy little creep	2720	” Ligur . Hastur and Ligur . Now , as Crowley would be the first to protest , most demons were n't deep down evil . In the great cosmic game they felt they occupied the same position as tax inspectors — doing an unpopular job , maybe , but essential to the overall operation of the whole thing . If it came to that , some angels were n't paragons of virtue ; Crowley had met one or two who , when it came to righteously smiting the ungodly , smote a good deal harder than was strictly necessary . On the whole , everyone had a job to do , and just did it . And on the other hand , you got people like Ligur and Hastur , who took such a dark delight in unpleasantness you might even have mistaken them for human . Crowley leaned back in his executive chair . He forced himself to relax and failed appallingly . "
86099	86103	86097	86097	people	934	” he called . "
86111	86130	86104	86104	We	2722	” said Ligur ( in a tone of voice intended 186 NEIL GAIMAN AND TERRY PRATCHETT to imply that “
86132	86136	86097	86097	people	934	” was synonymous with “
86140	86252	86104	86104	We	2722	” ) , and the squat demon pushed open the office door . The bucket teetered , then fell neatly on Ligur 's head . Drop a lump of sodium in water . Watch it flame and burn and spin around crazily , flaring and sputtering . This was like that ; just nastier . The demon peeled and flared and flickered . Oily brown smoke oozed from it , and it screamed and it screamed and it screamed . Then it crumpled , folded in on itself , and what was left lay glistening on the burnt and blackened circle of carpet , looking like a handful of mashed slugs . “
86255	86302	86104	86104	We	2722	” said Crowley to Hastur , who had been walking behind Ligur , and had unfortunately not been so much as splashed . There are some things that are unthinkable : there are some depths that not even demons would believe other demons would stoop to . "
86310	86314	86315	86315	You	2723	” said Hastur . “
86328	86329	86319	86319	He	2726	” “
86332	86379	86380	86380	Your	2723	” corrected Crowley , who felt a little more comfortable , now the odds were closer to even . Closer , but not yet even , not by a long shot . Hastur was a Duke of Hell . Crowley was n't even a local counsellor . "
86395	86414	86386	86386	mothers	2727	” said Hastur , and then felt that the language of Hell was n't up to the job . “
86428	86446	86426	86426	pal	2730	” he added . Crowley raised the green plastic plant mister , and sloshed it around threateningly . “
86450	86478	86479	86479	You	2723	” he said . He heard the phone downstairs ringing . Four times , and then the ansaphone caught it . He wondered vaguely who it was . "
86485	86515	86479	86479	You	2723	” said Hastur . He watched a drip of water leak from the nozzle and slide slowly down the side of the plastic container , toward Crowley 's hand . “
86523	86527	86517	86517	you	0	” asked Crowley . “
86576	86586	86572	86572	you	0	” he pointed to the mess on the carpet . “
86592	86612	86613	86613	You	2723	” Then the drip on the side of the plant mister reached Crowley 's curled fingers , and stopped . “
86617	86621	86613	86613	You	2723	” said Hastur . "
86626	86652	86623	86623	I	0	” said Crowley , in a tone of voice which he hoped made it quite clear that bluffing was the last thing on his mind . “
86664	86695	86660	86660	you	2723	” Hastur gestured , and the plastic bulb dissolved like rice paper , spilling water all over Crowley 's desk , and all over Crowley 's suit . GOOD OMENS 187 “
86698	86720	86722	86722	you	0	” said Hastur . And then he smiled . His teeth were too sharp , and his tongue flickered between them . “
86724	86762	86722	86722	you	0	” Crowley said nothing . Plan A had worked . Plan B had failed . Everything depended on Plan C , and there was one drawback to this : he had only ever planned as far as B. “
86765	86769	86722	86722	you	0	” hissed Hastur , “
86776	86777	86774	86774	Crowley	383	” "
86788	86796	86778	86778	I	0	” said Crowley , stalling for time . "
86801	86823	86853	86853	he	383	” smiled Hastur . Then the phone on Crowley 's desk rang . He picked it up , and warned Hastur , “
86845	86848	86850	86850	Crowley	383	“ Ngh , ”
86856	86865	86853	86853	he	383	“ Nuh . Got an old friend here . "
86905	86927	86902	86902	he	383	“ Okay , Hastur . You 've passed the test . You 're ready to start playing with the big boys . "
86928	86934	86902	86902	he	383	" Have you gone mad ? ”
86935	86976	86902	86902	he	383	“ Nope . Do n't you understand ? This was a test . The Lords of Hell had to know that you were trustworthy before we gave you command of the Legions of the Damned , in the War ahead . ”
86977	86995	86997	86997	Hastur	408	" Crowley , you are lying , or you are insane , or possibly you are both , ”
87077	87095	87096	87096	he	383	“ ' S'okay , Duke Hastur . I would n't expect you to believe it from me , "
87099	87120	87096	87096	he	383	“ But why do n't we talk to the Dark Council — I am sure that they can convince you . "
87132	87138	87139	87139	he	383	“ So long , sucker , ”
87640	87655	87635	87635	Hastur	408	“ You bastard ! I 'll get you . You ca n't escape me ! "
87684	87688	87676	87677	A demon	3875	" Soul Train . "
87724	87742	87743	87743	Crowley	383	“ Wherever you come out , I 'll come out too ! You wo n't get away ! ”
87881	87893	87870	87874	a voice from the speaker	2753	“ Right ! What ? . . . You bloody snake ! ”
88148	88154	88155	88155	she	2760	“ Why , Mr. Shadwell , ”
88158	88167	88155	88155	she	2760	“ whatever have you done to your hand ? ”
88168	88176	88177	88177	Shadwell	396	“ Get away frae me , wumman , ”
88180	88188	88177	88177	Shadwell	396	“ I dinna know my ane powers ! ”
88189	88199	88200	88200	Shadwell	396	" Why are you holding it out like that ? ”
88208	88221	88200	88200	Shadwell	396	“ Stand back , I tell ye ! I canna be responsible ! "
88222	88234	88236	88237	Madame Tracy	384	“ What on earth has happened to you , Mr. Shadwell ? ”
88245	88254	88255	88255	She	384	" Nothing on earth ! Nothing on earth ! "
88397	88413	88414	88414	she	384	“ I think you could do with a good lie - down , Mr. Shadwell , ”
88440	88448	88449	88449	Shadwell	396	“ But young Newt is out there , "
88452	88462	88449	88449	Shadwell	396	“ in thrall to heathen passions and occult wiles . "
88463	88477	88479	88480	Madame Tracy	384	" Then I 'm sure he 'll know what to do about them , "
88503	88542	88543	88543	She	384	“ And I 'm sure he would n't like to think of you getting yourself worked up into a state here . Just you lie down , and I 'll make us both a nice cup of tea . ”

102930	102982	102983	102983	Shadwell	396	“ The Antichrist is alive on earth at this moment , Sergeant . He is bringing about Armageddon , the Day of Judgement , even if he himself does not know it . Heaven and Hell are both preparing for war , and it 's all going to be very messy . ”
102987	103030	102983	102983	Shadwell	396	" I am not actually permitted to act directly in this matter , Sergeant . But I am sure that you can see that the imminent destruction of the world is not something any reasonable man would permit . Am I correct ? ”
103032	103037	103039	103039	Shadwell	396	" Aye . S'pose , ”
103056	103093	103048	103049	Madame Tracy	384	“ Then there is only one thing to be done . And you are the only man I can rely on . The Antichrist must be killed , Sergeant Shadwell . And you must do it . ”

103131	103162	103181	103181	Shadwell	396	" But , but the Antichrist is more than just a witch . He - he 's THE witch . He 's just about as witchy as you can get . "

108490	108565	108484	108484	He	401	“ At half past four in the afternoon . In August . What does that mean ? In terms of delighted nautical operatives , would you say ? I mean , if it takes a red sky at night to delight a sailor , what does it take to amuse the man who operates the computers on a supertanker ? Or is it shepherds who are delighted at night ? I can never remember . "
108611	108620	108621	108621	she	444	“ You must have got quite a bump , ”

108657	108667	108668	108668	she	444	“ Would you say it 's blood - colored ? ”
108671	108677	108668	108668	she	444	“ It 's very important . "
108678	108685	108687	108687	Newt	653	“ I would n't say that , ”
108696	108716	108717	108717	Anathema	444	“ Not actual blood . More pinkish . Probably the storm put a lot of dust in the air . ”
108727	108733	108734	108734	he	3245	“ What are you doing ? ”
108737	108749	108734	108734	he	3245	“ Trying to cross - reference . I still ca n't be "

108795	108892	108893	108893	Newt	653	“ I saw it on my way down here . And do n't snap like that . My head GOOD OMENS 231 aches . I mean I saw it . They 've got it written down outside that air base of yours . It 's got nothing to do with peas . It 's ' Peace Is Our Profession . It 's the kind of thing they put up on boards outside air bases . You know : SAC 8657745th Wing , The Screaming Blue Demons , Peace Is Our Profession . That sort of thing . "
108904	108937	108734	108734	he	3245	“ If Agnes is right , then there 's probably some madman in there right now winding up all the missiles and cranking open the launch windows . Or whatever they are . ”
108938	108945	108947	108947	Anathema	444	“ No , there is n't , ”
108950	108972	108947	108947	Anathema	444	" Oh , yes ? I 've seen films ! Name me one good reason why you can be so sure . ”
108973	108990	108734	108734	he	3245	“ There are n't any bombs there . Or missiles . Everyone round here knows that . ”
108991	109004	108734	108734	he	3245	“ But it 's an air base ! It 's got runways ! ”
109005	109034	109035	109035	Newt	653	“ That 's just for transport planes and things . All they 've got up there is communications gear . Radios and stuff . Nothing explosive at all . ”
109377	109388	109390	109390	Adam	401	" You 've got to help me sort it out , ”
109392	109416	109390	109390	Adam	401	“ People've been tryin ' to sort it out for thousands of years , but we 've got to sort it out now . ”
109421	109429	109431	109431	Adam	401	“ You see , the thing is , ”
109433	109449	109431	109431	Adam	401	“ this thing is , it 's like - well , you know Greasy Johnson . ”
109487	109490	109492	109492	Adam	401	" Well , ”
109494	109501	109492	109492	Adam	401	“ We always win , right ? "
109502	109506	109508	109508	Wensleydale	599	“ Nearly always , ”
109510	109514	109516	109516	Adam	401	" Nearly always , ”
109518	109521	109516	109516	Adam	401	“ An ' "
109522	109529	109531	109531	Pepper	402	“ More than half , anyway , ”
109533	109557	109531	109531	Pepper	402	“ 'Cos , you remember , when there was all that fuss over the ole folks ' party in the village hall when we ”
109558	109564	109566	109566	Adam	401	“ That does n't count , ”
109568	109622	109623	109623	He	401	“ They got told off just as much as us . Anyway , old folks are s'pposed to like listenin ' to the sound of children playin ' , I read that somewhere , I do n't see why we should get told off 'cos we 've got the wrong kind of old folks ”
109626	109634	109623	109623	He	401	“ Anyway ... we 're better'n them . ”
109635	109643	109645	109645	Pepper	402	“ Oh , we 're bettern them , ”
109647	109669	109645	109645	Pepper	402	" You 're right about that . We 're better'n them all right . We jus ' do n't always win . ”
109670	109674	109676	109676	Adam	401	" Just suppose , ”
109680	109721	109676	109676	Adam	401	“ that we could beat 'em properly . Get - get them sent away or somethin' . Jus ' make sure there 's no more ole gangs in Lower Tadfield apart from us . What do you think about that ? "
109722	109733	109735	109735	Brian	403	“ What , you mean he 'd be ... dead ? ”
109737	109745	109735	109735	Brian	403	“ No . Jus'-jus ' gone away . ”
109806	109817	109818	109818	he	403	“ I reckon it 'd be brilliant without Greasy Johnson , ”
109821	109839	109818	109818	he	403	“ Remember what he did at my birthday party ? And I got into trouble about it . "
109840	109844	109846	109846	Pepper	402	“ I dunno , ”
109848	109899	109846	109846	Pepper	402	“ I mean , it would n't be so interesting without ole Greasy Johnson and his gang . When you think about it . We 've had a lot of fun with ole Greasy Johnson and the Johnsonites . We 'd probably have to find some other gang or something . "
109900	109905	109907	109907	Wensleydale	599	" Seems to me , ”
109909	109934	109907	109907	Wensleydale	599	“ that if you asked people in Lower Tadfield , they 'd say they 'd be better off without the Johnsonites or the Them . ”
109947	109962	109942	109942	Wensleydale	599	“ The old folks ' club would . An ' Picky . An ' — "
109964	109972	109973	109973	Brian	403	“ But we 're the good ones ... ”
109979	109985	109986	109986	he	403	“ Well , all right , ”
109989	110012	109986	109986	he	403	“ but I bet they 'd think it 'd be a jolly sight less interestin ' if we all were n't here . "
110013	110016	110018	110018	Wensleydale	599	“ Yes , ”
110020	110027	110018	110018	Wensleydale	599	“ That 's what I mean . ”
110028	110040	110041	110041	he	599	“ People round here do n't want us or the Johnsonites , ”
110046	110091	110041	110041	he	599	“ the way they 're always goin' on about us just riding our bikes or skateboarding on their pavements and making too much noise and stuff . It 's like the man said in the history books . A plaque on both your houses . ”
110097	110104	110106	110106	Brian	403	“ One of those blue ones , ”
110110	110122	110106	110106	Brian	403	“ saying ' Adam Young Lived Here , ' or somethin' ? "
110154	110162	110163	110163	he	401	" What you 're all sayin ' , ”
110173	110197	110163	110163	he	401	“ is that it would n't be any good at all if the Greasy Johnsonites beat the Them or the other way round ? ”
110198	110203	110205	110205	Pepper	402	" That 's right , ”
110207	110210	110211	110211	she	402	" Because , ”
110214	110243	110211	110211	she	402	“ if we beat them , we 'd have to be our own deadly enemies . It 'd be me an ' Adam against Brian an ' Wensley , ”
110248	110255	110256	110256	she	402	“ Everyone needs a Greasy Johnson , ”
110259	110262	110264	110264	Adam	401	“ Yeah , ”
110266	110286	110287	110287	He	401	" That 's what I thought . It 's no good anyone winning . That 's what I thought . ”
110296	110303	110305	110305	Wensleydale	599	“ Seems simple enough to me , "
110310	110326	110305	110305	Wensleydale	599	“ I do n't see why it 's taken thousands of years to sort out . ”
110327	110341	110343	110343	Pepper	402	" That 's because the people trying to sort it out were men , ”
110353	110364	110366	110366	Wensleydale	599	“ Do n't see why you have to take sides , "
110368	110377	110379	110379	Pepper	402	" Of course I have to take sides , ”
110381	110390	110379	110379	Pepper	402	" Everyone has to take sides in something . ”
110398	110422	110423	110423	he	401	" Yes . But I reckon you can make your own side . I think you 'd better go and get your bikes , ”
110427	110442	110423	110423	he	401	" I think we 'd better sort of go and talk to some people . ”
110479	110490	110492	110493	Madame Tracy	384	" I 've never seen a traffic jam like it , ”
110495	110505	110492	110493	Madame Tracy	384	" I wonder if there 's been an accident . ”
110506	110510	110512	110512	Aziraphale	387	" Quite possibly , ”
110517	110547	110553	110553	Shadwell	396	“ Mr. Shadwell , unless you put your arms round me you 're going to fall off . This thing was n't built for two people , you know . ”
110548	110551	110553	110553	Shadwell	396	" Three , ”
110570	110581	110553	110553	Shadwell	396	" Mr. Shadwell , I wo n't tell you again . ”
110582	110598	110600	110600	Shadwell	396	" Ye'll have ter stop , then , so as I can adjust me weapon , ”
110710	110723	110725	110725	Aziraphale	387	" Dear lady , how fast would you say we were going ? ”
110727	110730	110725	110725	Aziraphale	387	“ Why ? ”
110731	110745	110810	110810	her	384	" Because it seems to me that we would go slightly faster walking . "
110746	110779	110846	110846	Shadwell	396	" Well , with just me on , the top speed is about fifteen miles an hour , but with Mr. Shadwell as well , it must be , ooh , about ... "
110780	110788	110789	110789	she	384	" Four or five miles per hour , "
110795	110800	110801	110801	she	384	“ I suppose so , "
110812	110824	110846	110846	Shadwell	396	" Can ye no slow down this hellish machine , wumman ? ”
110855	110860	110862	110862	Aziraphale	387	“ In which case , ”
110864	110877	110862	110862	Aziraphale	387	" we will get to Tadfield in something less than ten hours . "
110888	110898	110883	110884	Madame Tracy	384	“ How far away is this Tadfield , anyway ? ”
110899	110904	110910	110911	Madame Tracy	384	" About forty miles . ”
110905	110908	110910	110911	Madame Tracy	384	“ Um , ”
110952	110973	110975	110975	Aziraphale	387	" ... we should really be going at about seventy , if we 're going to get there in time , ”
110977	110989	110975	110975	Aziraphale	387	“ Hmm . Sergeant Shadwell ? Hold on very tightly now . "
111051	111060	111062	111062	Aziraphale	387	" Do n't look down , Sergeant Shadwell , ”
111064	111066	111068	111068	Shadwell	651	“ ... ”
111089	111097	111068	111068	Shadwell	651	“ And off we go , then . "
111399	111413	111414	111414	he	3296	“ Look . I do n't care if you believe me or not , ”
111417	111456	111457	111462	One of the senior army technicians	3297	“ all I 'm telling you is what I saw . It was an old car , a Rolls , or a Bentley , one of those flash vintage jobs , and it made it over the bridge . ”
111465	111491	111457	111462	One of the senior army technicians	3297	“ It ca n't have done . According to our instruments the temperature above the M25 is somewhere in excess of seven hundred degrees centigrade . "
111492	111501	111503	111504	his assistant	3299	" Or a hundred and forty degrees below , "
111506	111517	111519	111521	the senior technician	3300	" ... or a hundred and forty degrees below zero , ”
111523	111590	111519	111521	the senior technician	3300	" There does appear to be some confusion on that score , although I think we can safely attribute it to mechanical error of some kind , * but the fact remains that we ca n't even get a helicopter directly over the M25 without winding up with Helicopter McNuggets . How on earth can you tell me that a vintage car drove over it unharmed ? ”
111591	111602	111604	111605	the policeman	3301	“ I did n't say it drove over it unharmed , ”
111642	111654	111668	111668	somebody	5654	“ It burst into flames . It just kept on going . "
111655	111666	111668	111668	somebody	5654	“ Do you seriously expect any of us to believe ... "
111858	111861	111852	111852	she	5672	“ Gerrrronnnimo0000 ! ”
111908	111921	111893	111893	Newt	653	" You 've made me drop all the cards on the floor ! ”
111941	111946	111893	111893	Newt	653	" Oil plessure arert . ”
111947	111959	111960	111960	she	5672	" I 'll never be able to sort them out now , ”
111963	111970	111972	111972	Newt	653	" You do n't have to , ”
111975	111988	111972	111972	Newt	653	“ Just pick one . Any one . It wo n't matter . "
111989	111995	111893	111893	Newt	653	“ What do you mean ? ”
111996	112032	111893	111893	Newt	653	“ Well , if Agnes is right , and we 're doing all this because she 's predicted it , then any card picked right now has got to be relevant . That 's logic . ”
112033	112038	111972	111972	Newt	653	“ It 's nonsense . "
112039	112081	111893	111893	Newt	653	“ Yeah ? Look , you 're even here because she predicted it . And have you thought what we 're going to say to the colonel ? If we get to see him , which of course we wo n't . ”
112082	112088	111893	111893	Newt	653	" If we 're reasonable -- "
112089	112234	111972	111972	Newt	653	" Listen , I know these kinds of places . They have huge guards made out of teak guarding the gates , Anathema , and they have white helmets and real guns , you understand , which fire real bullets made of real lead which can go right into you and bounce around and come out of the same hole before you can even say ' Excuse me , we have reason to believe that World War Three is due any moment and they 're going to do the show right here , ' and then they have serious men in suits with bulging jackets who take you into a little room without windows and ask you questions like are you now , or have you ever been , a member of a pinko subversive organization such as any British political party ? And — ”
112236	112242	111893	111893	Newt	653	“ We 're nearly there . "
112243	112266	112268	112269	NEIL GAIMAN	437	“ Look , it 's got gates and wire fences and everything ! And probably the kind of dogs that eat people ! ”
112273	112282	112284	112284	Anathema	444	“ I think you 're getting rather overexcited , ”
112302	112319	112284	112284	Anathema	444	“ Overexcited ? No ! I 'm getting very calmly worried that someone might shoot me ! ”
112320	112347	112348	112348	She	444	“ I 'm sure Agnes would have mentioned it if we were going to be shot . She 's very good at that sort of thing . "
112357	112361	112362	112362	she	444	“ You know , ”
112376	112433	112362	112362	she	444	“ I read somewhere that there 's a sect that believes that computers are the tools of the Devil . They say that Armageddon will come about because of the Antichrist being good with computers . Apparently it 's mentioned somewhere in Revelations . I think I must have read about it in a newspaper recently ... "
112435	112450	112452	112452	Newt	653	“ Daily Mail . ' Letter From America . Um , August the third , ”
112454	112476	112452	112452	Newt	653	“ Just after the story about the woman in Worms , Nebraska , who taught her duck to play the accordion . ”
112477	112480	112482	112482	Anathema	444	“ Mm , ”
112589	112593	112595	112595	Newt	653	" All right , ”
112597	112602	112595	112595	Newt	653	" Pick a card . ”
112616	112621	112595	112595	Newt	653	“ Is that all ? "
112622	112647	112558	112562	some men with a digger	3319	“ Yes . We always thought it was something to do with the Russian Revolution . Keep going along this road and turn left . ”
112669	112689	112691	112691	Anathema	444	“ And now pull in here . There 's often cars here , and no one takes any notice , ”
112693	112699	112691	112691	Anathema	444	" What is this place ? "
112700	112709	112595	112595	Newt	653	" It 's the local Lovers ' Lane . "
112710	112722	112723	112723	They	3319	“ Is that why it appears to be paved with rubber ? ”
112819	112826	112827	112827	he	4053	“ Oh , hi , Anathema , ”
112830	112842	112827	112827	he	4053	" Hi , George . Terrible storm , was n't it . ”
112843	112847	112848	112848	They	3319	" Sure was . ”
112859	112864	112866	112866	Newt	653	“ You know him ? ”
112872	112897	112866	112866	Newt	653	“ Oh , sure . Sometimes a few of them come down to the pub . Pleasant enough in a well - scrubbed way . ”
112898	112909	112911	112911	Newt	653	“ Would he shoot us if we just walked in ? ”
112913	112927	112911	112911	Newt	653	“ He might well point a gun at us in a menacing way , ”
112931	112948	112911	112911	Newt	653	" That 's good enough for me . What do you suggest we do , then ? ”
112949	112977	112999	112999	he	653	" Well , Agnes must have known something . So I suppose we just wait . It 's not too bad now the wind 's gone down . ”
112978	112981	112982	112982	Newt	653	“ Oh . ”
112993	112998	112999	112999	he	653	“ Good old Agnes , ”

113101	113106	113108	113108	Adam	401	“ 'S all muddy , ”
113110	113115	113117	113117	Pepper	402	“ That 's right , ”
113120	113155	113117	113117	Pepper	402	“ It gets all muddy up there . We ort to go along by the chalk pit . 'S always dry because of the chalk . An ' then up by the sewage farm . ”

113211	113243	113209	113209	Pepper	402	" I went up there when they had that open day and they had no guns or missiles or anythin ' . Just knobs and dials and brass bands playin ' . "

113257	113266	113268	113268	Pepper	402	“ Not much milit'ry about knobs and dials , ”

113280	113294	113278	113278	Adam	401	“ It 's amazin ' what you can do with knobs and dials . "

113307	113334	113304	113304	Wensleydale	599	“ All electric bits . There were a few knobs and dials in it . You could make a radio or a thing that goes beep . "

113344	113372	113341	113341	Adam	401	" I 'm thinkin ' more of certain people patching into the worldwide milit'ry communications network and telling all the computers and stuff to start fightin ' . ”

121646	121666	121667	121667	He	401	“ Well , it 's sort of like that , only now I 've found how to do it . ”

He wrapped his hand in his handkerchief and pulled a couple of boards out of their sockets . Once , one of the electronics magazines to which he subscribed had published a joke circuit which was guaranteed not to work . At last , they 'd said in an amusing way , here 's something all you ham - fisted hams out there can build in the certain knowledge that if it does nothing , it 's working . It had diodes the wrong way round , transistors upside down , and a flat battery . Newt had built it , and it picked up Radio Moscow . He 'd written them a letter of complaint , but they never replied . “
123125	123129	123130	123131	James Bond	849	” he said . "

123211	123467	123205	123205	I	0	” Clouds churned around the horizon . Overhead the sky was still clear , the air torn by nothing more than a light breeze . But it was n't normal air . It had a crystallized look to it , so that you might feel that if you turned your head you might see new facets . It sparkled . If you had to find a word to describe it , the word thronged might slip insidiously into your mind . Thronged with insubstantial beings awaiting only the right moment to become very substantial . Adam glanced up . In one sense there was just clear air overhead . In another , stretching off to infinity , were the hosts of Heaven and Hell , wingtip to wingtip . If you looked really closely , and had been specially trained , you could tell the difference . Silence held the bubble of the world in its grip . The door of the building swung open and the Four stepped out . There was no more than a hint of human about three of them now - they seemed to be humanoid shapes made up of all the things they were or GOOD OMENS 261 represented . They made Death seem positively homely . His leather greatcoat and dark - visored helmet had become a cowled robe , but these were mere details . A skeleton , even a walking one , is at least human ; Death of a sort lurks inside every living creature . “
123472	123477	123484	123484	They	3610	” said Adam urgently , “
123492	123493	123484	123484	They	3610	” “
123502	123515	123497	123497	we	3611	” said Pepper . Dog whined and tried to hide behind Adam . “
123526	123547	123521	123521	he	3612	” said Brian , pointing at the advancing figure , if such it could still be called , of Pollution . “
123554	123560	123549	123549	you	3613	” said Adam , encouragingly . “
123584	123622	123549	123549	you	3613	” The Four halted a few meters away . IT HAS BEEN DONE , said Death . He leaned forward a little and stared eyelessly at Adam . It was hard to tell if he was surprised . “
123627	123631	123549	123549	you	3613	” said Adam . “
123652	123702	123643	123643	I	0	” Death looked at the other three , and then back to Adam . Behind them a jeep skewed to a halt . They ignored it . I DO NOT UNDERSTAND , he said . SURELY YOUR VERY EXISTENCE REQUIRES THE ENDING OF THE WORLD . IT IS WRITTEN . "
123718	123723	123703	123703	I	0	” said Adam calmly . "

123832	123842	123822	123822	You	0	” said War , between teeth like beautiful bullets . "
123856	123877	123878	123878	You	0	” said Pollution , his voice as insidious as something leaking out of a corroded drum into a water table . “
123888	123955	123878	123878	You	0	” said Famine . And Adam hesitated . Voices inside him still cried out that this was true , and that the world was his as well , and all he had to do was turn and lead them out across a bewildered planet . They were his kind of people . In tiers above , the hosts of the sky waited for the Word . ( “

124061	124102	124103	124104	Little boys	3623	” said Adam , quietly . The slouch and slur was gone from his voice . It had strange harmonics . No one human could disobey a voice like that . War laughed , and looked expectantly at the Them . "
124106	124110	124103	124104	Little boys	3623	” she said , "
124154	124210	124211	124211	I	0	" She laughed again , but the machine - gun stutter died away as Pepper stepped forward and raised a trembling arm . It was n't much of a sword , but it was about the best you could do with two bits of wood and a piece of string . War stared at it . “
124214	124218	124211	124211	I	0	” she said . "
124225	124272	124211	124211	I	0	” She drew her own blade and brought it up so that it made a noise like a finger being dragged around a wineglass . There was a flash as they connected . Death stared into Adam 's eyes . There was a pathetic jingling noise . "
124278	124302	124304	124305	Little boys	3623	” snapped Adam , without moving his head . The Them stared at the sword rocking to a standstill on the concrete path . “
124308	124327	124304	124305	Little boys	3623	” muttered Pepper , disgustedly . Sooner or later everyone has to decide which gang they belong to . “
124332	124336	124337	124337	she	3627	” said Brian , "
124345	124436	124304	124305	Little boys	3623	" The air between Adam and Death began to vibrate , as in a heatwave . Wensleydale raised his head and looked Famine in the sunken eye . He held up something that , with a bit of imagination , could be considered to be a pair of scales made of more string and twigs . Then he whirled it around his head . Famine stuck out a protective arm . There was another flash , and then the jingle of a pair of silver scales bouncing on the ground . “
124446	124576	124304	124305	Little boys	3623	” said Adam . Pollution had already started to run , or at least to flow quickly , but Brian snatched the circle of grass stalks from his own head and flung it . It GOOD OMENS 263 should n't have handled like one , but a force took it out of his hands and it whirred like a discus . This time the explosion was a red flame inside a billow of black smoke , and it smelled of oil . With a rolling , tinny little sound a blackened silver crown bowled out of the smoke and then spun round with a noise like a settling penny . At least they needed no warning about touching it . It glistened in a way that metal should not . "
124582	124732	124304	124305	Little boys	3623	” said Wensley . WHERE THEY BELONG , said Death , still holding Adam 's gaze . WHERE THEY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN . BACK IN THE MINDS OF MAN . He grinned at Adam . There was a tearing sound . Death 's robe split and his wings unfolded . Angel 's wings . But not of feathers . They were wings of night , wings that were shapes cut through the matter of creation into the darkness underneath , in which a few distant lights glimmered , lights that may have been stars or may have been something entirely else . .. BUT I , he said , AM NOT LIKE THEM . I AM AZRAEL , CRE . ATED TO BE CREATION 'S SHADOW . YOU CANNOT DESTROY ME . THAT WOULD DESTROY THE WORLD . The heat of their stare faded . Adam scratched his nose . "

NORMAL ENTROPY TRIUMPHS . Death raised a bony hand in what might have been a salute . THEY'LL BE BACK , he said . THEY'RE NEVER FAR AWAY . The wings flapped , just once , like a thunderclap , and the angel of Death vanished . “
124881	124890	124791	124791	I	0	” said Adam , to the empty air . “

125901	125912	125914	125914	Adam	401	“ ' Scuse me , why 're you two people ? ”
125916	125919	125921	125921	Aziraphale	387	" Well , ”
125923	125928	125921	125921	Aziraphale	387	“ it 's a long "
125929	125939	125941	125941	Adam	401	“ It 's not right , being two people , ”
125943	125957	125941	125941	Adam	401	“ I reckon you 'd better go back to being two sep’rate people . ”
125976	125983	125984	125984	she	384	“ Ooh , that felt tingly , ”
125994	125997	125998	125998	she	384	“ Oh , ”
126007	126017	125998	125998	she	384	“ Somehow , I thought you 'd be younger . ”

126073	126076	126078	126078	Crowley	383	" No , ”
126080	126094	126078	126078	Crowley	383	" No . It is n't , you see . Not at all . ”
126111	126115	126117	126117	Crowley	383	“ You see , ”
126126	126234	126117	126117	Crowley	383	" it does n't really work that simply . You think wars get started because some old duke gets shot , or someone cuts off someone 's ear , or someone 's sited their missiles in the wrong place . It 's not like that . That 's just , well , just reasons , which have n't got anything to do with it . What really causes wars is two sides that ca n't stand the sight of one another and the pressure builds up and up and then anything will cause it . Anything at all . What 's your name ... er ... boy ? "
126235	126241	126246	126246	she	444	“ That 's Adam Young , ”
126255	126263	126265	126265	Adam	401	“ That 's right . Adam Young , ”
126267	126283	126285	126285	Crowley	383	“ Good effort . You 've saved the world . Have a half - holiday , ”
126287	126297	126285	126285	Crowley	383	“ But it wo n't really make any difference . "
126298	126305	126307	126307	Aziraphale	387	“ I think you 're right , ”
126309	126323	126307	126307	Aziraphale	387	“ I 'm sure my people want Armageddon . It 's very sad . ”
126324	126335	126337	126337	Anathema	444	“ Would anyone mind telling us what 's going on ? ”
126347	126355	126356	126356	he	387	“ It 's a very long story , "
126365	126371	126372	126372	she	444	“ Go on , then , ”
126375	126382	126372	126372	she	444	“ Well . In the Beginning — "
126447	126451	126453	126453	Aziraphale	387	" Oh dear , ”
126455	126460	126453	126453	Aziraphale	387	" It 's him . ”

126469	126475	126477	126478	the angel	906	“ The Voice of God , ”

126493	126520	126490	126490	Pepper	402	“ No , it is n't . The Metatron 's made of plastic and it 's got laser cannon and it can turn into a helicopter . "
126521	126528	126530	126530	Wensleydale	599	“ That 's the Cosmic Megatron , ”
126533	126551	126530	126530	Wensleydale	599	" I had one , but the head fell off . I think this one is different . ”
126647	126650	126652	126652	Crowley	383	“ Er , ”
126661	126666	126652	126652	Crowley	383	" Hi ... er . "
126739	126754	126734	126734	Adam	401	“ Huh ? No . I said already . My name 's Adam Young . ”
126763	126768	126755	126755	He	401	“ What 's yours ? ”
126769	126772	126773	126773	Crowley	383	" Beelzebub , "

126784	126790	126792	126792	Beelzebub	858	“ Thank you , Crowzley , ”
126794	126813	126792	126792	Beelzebub	858	“ Later we muzzed have a seriouzz talk . I am sure thou hazzt muzzch to tell me . ”
126814	126817	126819	126819	Crowley	383	“ Er , ”
126821	126831	126819	126819	Crowley	383	" well , you see , what happened was — ”
126832	126835	126773	126773	Crowley	383	“ Silenzz ! "
126836	126841	126843	126843	Crowley	383	“ Right . Right , ”
126846	126853	126855	126856	the Metatron	736	“ Now then , Adam Young , "
126858	126901	126855	126856	the Metatron	736	“ while we can of course appreciate your assistance at this point , we must add that Armageddon should take place now . There may be some temporary inconvenience , but that should hardly stand in the way of the ultimate good . ”
126902	126905	126907	126907	Crowley	383	“ Ah , ”
126911	126929	126907	126907	Crowley	383	" what he means is , we have to destroy the world in order to save it . ”
126930	126948	126950	126950	Beelzebub	858	“ Azz to what it standz in the way of , that hazz yet to be decided , "
126952	126971	126950	126950	Beelzebub	858	“ But it muzzt be decided now , boy . That izz thy deztiny . It is written . ”
127001	127019	127020	127020	Adam	401	“ I just do n't see why everyone and everything has to be burned up and everything , "
127023	127119	127120	127120	he	3670	“ Millions of fish an ' whales an ' trees an ' , an ' sheep and stuff . An ' not even for anything important . Jus ' to see who 's got the best gang . It 's like us an ' the Johnsonites . But even if you win , you ca n't really beat the other side , because you do n't really want to . I mean , not for good . You 'll just start all over again . You 'll just keep on sending people like these two , ”
127127	127154	127120	127120	he	3670	“ to mess people around . It 's hard enough bein ' people as it is , without other people coming and messin ' you around . ”
127160	127163	127164	127164	he	383	“ Johnsonites ? ”
127171	127179	127180	127180	he	3670	“ Early breakaway sect , I think , ”
127183	127192	127180	127180	he	3670	“ Sort of Gnostics . Like the Ophites . ”
127197	127234	127193	127193	His	3670	“ Or were they the Sethites ? No , I 'm thinking of the Collyridians . Oh dear . I 'm sorry , there were hundreds of them , it 's so hard to keep track . ”
127235	127242	127244	127244	Crowley	383	“ People bein ' messed around , "
127246	127252	127244	127244	Crowley	383	“ It does n't matter ! ”
127257	127271	127254	127255	the Metatron	736	" The whole point of the creation of the Earth and Good and Evil "
127272	127297	127299	127299	Adam	401	" I do n't see what 's so triffic about creating people as people and then gettin ' upset 'cos they act like people , ”
127302	127396	127299	127299	Adam	401	“ Anyway , if you stopped tellin ' people it 's all sorted out after they 're dead , they might try sorting it all out while they 're alive . If I was in charge , I 'd try makin ' people live a lot longer , like ole Methuselah . It 'd be a lot more interestin ' and they might start thinkin ' about the sort of things they 're doing to all the enviroment and ecology , because they 'll still be around in a hundred years ' time . ”
127397	127400	127402	127402	Beelzebub	858	" Ah , ”
127411	127425	127405	127405	he	858	" You wizzsh to rule the world . That’z more like thy Fath — "
127426	127440	127442	127442	Adam	401	“ I thought about all that an ' I do n't want to , ”
127453	127526	127405	127405	he	858	“ I mean , there 's some stuff could do with alt'rin ' , but then I expect people'd keep comin ' up to me and gettin ' me to sort out everythin ' the whole time and get rid of all the rubbish and make more trees for 'em , and where 's the good in all that ? It 's like havin' to tidy up people 's bedrooms for them . ”
127527	127536	127538	127538	Pepper	402	“ You never tidy up even your bedroom , ”
127543	127553	127555	127555	Adam	401	“ I never said anythin ' about my bedroom , "
127572	127602	127555	127555	Adam	401	“ It 's general bedrooms I mean . I dint mean my personal bedroom . It 's an analoggy . That 's jus ' what I 'm sayin ' . ”
127615	127618	127620	127620	Adam	401	" Anyway , ”
127622	127669	127620	127620	Adam	401	“ it 's bad enough having to think of things for Pepper and Wensley and Brian to do all the time so they do n't get bored , so I do n't want any more world than I 've got . Thank you all the same . ”
127693	127704	127670	127671	The Metatron	736	“ You ca n't refuse to be who you are , "
127709	127737	127670	127671	The Metatron	736	“ Listen . Your birth and destiny are part of the Great Plan . Things have to happen like this . All the choices have been made . ”
127738	127745	127747	127747	Beelzebub	858	“ Rebellion izz a fine thing , ”
127749	127761	127747	127747	Beelzebub	858	“ but some thingz are beyond rebellion . You muzzt understand ! ”
127762	127770	127772	127772	Adam	401	" I 'm not rebelling against anything , ”
127780	127856	127857	127857	he	401	“ I 'm pointin ' out things . Seems to me you ca n't blame people for pointin ' out things . Seems to me it 'd be a lot better not to start fightin ' and jus ' see what people do . If you stop messin ' them about they might start thinkin ' properly an ' they might stop messin ' the world around . I 'm not sayin ' they would , ”
127861	127866	127857	127857	he	401	“ but they might . ”
127867	127873	127875	127876	the Metatron	736	“ This makes no sense , ”
127878	127901	127875	127876	the Metatron	736	“ You ca n't run counter to the Great Plan . You must think . It 's in your genes . Think . ”
127982	128000	128001	128001	he	383	“ For a moment there , just for a moment , I thought we had a chance , "
128004	128018	128001	128001	he	383	" He had them worried . Oh , well , it was nice while "

128044	128049	128050	128050	he	401	“ This Great Plan , ”
128053	128064	128050	128050	he	401	“ this would be the ineffable Plan , would it ? ”
128072	128079	128081	128082	the Metatron	736	" It 's the Great Plan , ”
128085	128106	128081	128082	the Metatron	736	“ You are well aware . There shall be a world lasting six thousand years and it will conclude with — "
128107	128120	128122	128122	Aziraphale	387	“ Yes , yes , that 's the Great Plan all right , ”
128164	128186	128158	128159	TERRY PRATCHETT	437	" I was just asking if it 's ineffable as well . I just want to be clear on this point . "
128187	128193	128195	128196	the Metatron	736	" It does n't matter ! ”
128198	128207	128195	128196	the Metatron	736	“ It 's the same thing , surely ! ”
128227	128239	128241	128241	Aziraphale	387	“ So you 're not one hundred percent clear on this ? ”
128243	128256	128258	128259	the Metatron	736	“ It 's not given to us to understand the ineffable Plan , "
128261	128269	128258	128259	the Metatron	736	“ but of course the Great Plan — "
128270	128286	128288	128288	Crowley	383	“ But the Great Plan can only be a tiny part of the overall ineffability , "
128290	128314	128288	128288	Crowley	383	“ You ca n't be certain that what 's happening right now is n't exactly right , from an ineffable point of view . ”
128315	128320	128322	128322	Beelzebub	858	" It izz written ! ”
128324	128334	128336	128336	Crowley	383	“ But it might be written differently somewhere else , ”
128338	128346	128336	128336	Crowley	383	" Where you ca n't read it . ”
128347	128352	128354	128354	Aziraphale	387	“ In bigger letters , ”
128356	128359	128360	128360	Crowley	383	“ Underlined , ”
128363	128366	128360	128360	Crowley	383	“ Twice , "
128370	128382	128384	128384	Crowley	383	“ Perhaps this is n't just a test of the world , ”
128386	128400	128384	128384	Crowley	383	“ It might be a test of you people , too . Hmm ? "
128401	128412	128414	128415	the Metatron	736	" God does not play games with His loyal servants , "
128425	128430	128432	128432	Crowley	383	“ Whooo - eee , ”
128434	128440	128432	128432	Crowley	383	“ Where have you been ? ”
128461	128487	128458	128458	he	401	“ I do n't see why it matters what is written . Not when it 's about people . It can always be crossed out . ”
128548	128554	128555	128555	he	383	" You know what happened ? ”
128559	128586	128555	128555	he	383	“ He was left alone ! He grew up human ! He 's not Evil Incarnate or Good Incarnate , he 's just ... a human incarnate ”
128589	128593	128595	128596	the Metatron	5563	“ I think , ”
128598	128608	128595	128596	the Metatron	5563	“ that I shall need to seek further instructions . ”
128609	128613	128615	128615	Beelzebub	858	“ I alzzo , ”

128841	128850	128838	128838	Crowley	383	“ Not for us , I 'm afraid . ”
128851	128863	128865	128865	Adam	401	“ I do n't think you need to go worryin ' , ”
128868	128881	128865	128865	Adam	401	“ I know all about you two . Do n't you worry . ”
128911	128958	128908	128908	he	401	“ There 's been too much messin ' around anyway . But it seems to me everyone 's goin' to be a lot happier if they forget about this . Not actually forget , just not remember exactly . An ' then we can go home . ”
128959	128970	128972	128972	Anathema	444	“ But you ca n't just leave it at that ! ”
128977	128989	128972	128972	Anathema	444	“ Think of all things you could do ! Good things . ”
128990	128994	128996	128996	Adam	401	“ Like what ? ”
128999	129016	128996	128996	Adam	401	" Well . . . you could bring all the whales back , to start with . ”
129025	129038	129017	129017	He	401	“ An ' that 'd stop people killing them , would it ? ”
129051	129071	129073	129073	Adam	401	“ An ' if people do start killing 'em , what would you ask me to do about 'em ? ”
129075	129131	129073	129073	Adam	401	“ No . I reckon I 'm getting the hang of this now . Once I start messing around like that , there 'd be no stoppin ' it . Seems to me , the only sensible thing is for people to know if they kill a whale , they 've got a dead whale . ”
129132	129140	129142	129142	Newt	653	“ That shows a very responsible attitude , ”
129157	129163	129164	129164	he	401	" It 's just sense , ”

129210	129216	129208	129208	Crowley	383	" Is your car operational ? ”
129217	129228	129229	129229	Crowley	383	" I think it might need a bit of work , ”
129232	129246	129248	129248	Aziraphale	387	“ I was thinking that we might take these good people into town , "
129250	129270	129248	129248	Aziraphale	387	“ I owe Madame Tracy a meal , I 'm sure . And her young man , of course . ”

129350	129358	129348	129348	Adam	401	“ But you could help so much — ”

It had contained certain instructions and five interesting facts about the history of the next ten years which , if put to good use by a keen young man , would ensure enough finance to pursue a very successful legal career . All he had to do was see that the box was carefully looked after for rather more than three hundred years , and then delivered to a certain address ... "

134785	134893	134758	134758	you	0	" Newt heard the snap of a wax seal and the clink of something on the table . Then there was a gasp , the clatter of a chair , the sound of running feet in the hallway , the slam of a door , and the sound of a car engine being jerked into life and then redlined down the lane . Newt took the saucepan off his head and came out from behind the door . He picked up the letter and was not one hundred percent surprised to see that it was addressed to Mr. G. Baddicombe . He unfolded it . It read : “
134923	134943	134915	134916	Mistrefs Spiddon	884	" Newt looked at the other letters . The crackling paper of the one addressed to George Cranby said : "
134972	135006	135007	135007	Yowe	885	” Newt wondered what a snatch - pastry was . He would be prepared to bet that it did n't involve cookery . The one that had awaited the inquisitive Mr. Bychance said : “
135037	135050	134956	134956	yowe	3794	” Under the letters was a manuscript . Newt stared at it . "

135110	135134	135101	135101	You	3798	” she said , pushing him aside . He shrugged as she put her hands around the yellowed manuscript and lifted it out . “

St. James ' Park was comparatively quiet . The ducks , who were experts in realpolitik as seen from the bread end , put it down to a decrease in world tension . There really had been a decrease in world tension , in fact , but a lot of people were in offices trying to find out why , trying to find where Atlantis had disappeared to with three international fact - finding delegations on it , and trying to work out what had happened to all their computers yesterday . The park was deserted except for a member of M19 trying to recruit someone who , to their later mutual embarrassment , would turn out to be also a member of MI9 , and a tall man feeding the ducks . And there were also Crowley and Aziraphale . They strolled side by side across the grass . “

And perhaps the recent exertions had had some fallout in the nature of reality because , while they were eating , for the first time ever , a nightingale sang in Berkeley Square . No one heard it over the noise of the traffic , but it was there , right enough . It was one o'clock on Sunday . For the last decade Sunday lunch in Witchfinder Sergeant Shadwell 's world had followed an invariable routine . He would sit at the rickety , cigarette - burned table in his room , thumbing through an elderly copy of one of the Witchfinder Army library 's * books on magic and Demonology — the Necrotelecomnicon or the Liber Fulvarum Paginarum , or his old favorite , the Malleus Malleficarum . * * Then there would be a knock on the door , and Madame Tracy would call out , “
136549	136555	136546	136547	Mr. Shadwell	396	” and Shadwell would mutter , “
136559	136741	136546	136547	Mr. Shadwell	396	" and wait sixty seconds , to allow the shameless hussy time to get back into her room ; then he 'd open the door , and pick up the plate of liver , which was usually carefully covered by another plate to keep it warm . And he 'd take it in , and he 'd eat it , taking moderate care not to spill any gravy on the pages he was reading . * * * That was what always happened . Except on that Sunday , it did n't . For a start , he was n't reading . He was just sitting . And when the knock came on the door he got up immediately , and opened it . He need n't have hurried . . There was no plate . There was just Madame Tracy , wearing a cameo brooch , and an unfamiliar shade of lipstick . She was also standing in the center of a perfume zone .

136831	136845	136846	136846	Hullo	892	” Madame Tracy 's voice was bright and fast and brittle with uncertainty . “

He did n't remember it properly , just one phrase , that still echoed in his head and disturbed him . The dream had vanished into a haze , like the events of the previous night . It was this . “
137005	137029	136963	136964	a witchfinder	2387	" For the second time in twenty - four hours for the second time in his life he entered Madame Tracy 's rooms . “
137034	137135	136963	136964	a witchfinder	2387	” she told him , pointing to an armchair . It had an antimacassar on the headrest , a plumped - up pillow on the seat , and a small footstool . He sat down . She placed a tray on his lap , and watched him eat , and removed his plate when he had finished . Then she opened a bottle of Guinness , poured it into a glass and gave it to him , then sipped her tea while he slurped his stout . When she put her cup down , it tinkled nervously in the saucer . “

137241	137257	137239	137239	love	5264	" Shadwell realized with dawning horror that he was comfortable . Horribly , terrifyingly comfortable . “
137260	137288	137239	137239	love	5264	” he said , warily . He had never been so comfortable . Madame Tracy opened another bottle of Guinness and placed it in front of him . “

137392	137515	137341	137341	they	3831	" Shadwell realized that she was talking about him . He was n't sure about this . He had a distinct feeling that leaving Witchfinder Private Pulsifer with the young lady in Tadfield had been a bad move , as far as the Witchfinder Army Booke of Rules and Reggulations was concerned . And this seemed even more dangerous . Still , at his age , when you 're getting too old to go crawling about in the long grass , when the chill morning dew gets into your bones ... ( An ' tomorrow we could hide , an it 'd be the witches ' turn to find us ... ) Madame Tracy opened another bottle of Guinness , and giggled . “
137520	137524	137341	137341	they	3831	” she said , "
137537	137576	137529	137529	I	0	” He grunted . There was a formality that had to be observed in all this . Witchfinder Sergeant Shadwell took a long , deep drink of Guinness , and he popped the question . Madame Tracy giggled . “
137583	137594	137579	137579	you	3833	” she said , and she blushed a deep red . “
137601	137607	137598	137598	you	3833	" He popped it again . “
137610	137615	137598	137598	you	3833	" said Madame Tracy . “
137626	138400	138401	138401	Adam	401	” said Witchfinder Sergeant Shadwell ( retired ) . It was Sunday afternoon . High over England a 747 droned westwards . In the first - class cabin a boy called Warlock put down his comic and stared out of the window . It had been a very strange couple of days . He still was n't certain why his father had been called to the Middle East . He was pretty sure that his father did n't know , either . It was probably something cultural . All that had happened was a lot of funny - looking guys with towels on their heads and very bad teeth had shown them around some old ruins . As ruins went , Warlock had seen better . And then one of the old guys had said to him , was n't there anything he wanted to do ? And Warlock had said he 'd like to leave . They 'd looked very unhappy about that . And now he was going back to the States . There had been some sort of problem with tickets or flights or airport destination - boards or 292 NEIL GAIMAN AND TERRY PRATCHETT opices below Greasy ’s liftching on in Europe.mages had been something . It was weird ; he was pretty sure his father had meant to go back to England . Warlock liked England . It was a nice country to be an American in . The plane was at that point passing right above the Lower Tadfield bedroom of Greasy Johnson , who was aimlessly leafing through a photography magazine that he 'd bought merely because it had a rather good picture of a tropical fish on the cover . A few pages below Greasy 's listless finger was a spread on American football , and how it was really catching on in Europe . Which was odd --because when the magazine had been printed , those pages had been about photography in desert conditions . It was about to change his life . And Warlock flew on to America . He deserved something ( after all , you never forget the first friends you ever had , even if you were all a few hours old at the time ) and the power that was controlling the fate of all mankind at that precise time was thinking : Well , he 's going to America , is n't he ? Do n't see how you could have anythin ' better than going to America They 've got thirty - nine flavors of ice cream there . Maybe even more . There were a million exciting things a boy and his dog could be doing on a Sunday afternoon . Adam could think of four or five hundred of them without even trying . Thrilling things , stirring things , planets to be conquered , lions to be tamed , lost South American worlds teeming with dinosaurs to be discovered and befriended . He sat in the garden , and scratched in the dirt with a pebble , looking despondent . His father had found Adam asleep on his return from the air base sleeping , to all intents and purposes , as if he had been in bed all evening . Even snoring once in a while , for verisimilitude . At breakfast the next morning , however , it was made clear that this had not been enough . Mr. Young disliked gallivanting about of a Saturday evening on a wild - goose chase . And if , by some unimaginable fluke , Adam was not responsible for the night 's disturbances — whatever they had been , since nobody had seemed very clear on the details , only that there had been disturbances of some sort — then he was undoubtedly guilty of something . This was Mr. Young 's attitude , and it had served him well for the last eleven years . Adam sat dispiritedly in the garden . The August sun hung high in GOOD OMENS 293 an August blue and cloudless sky , and behind the hedge a thrush sang , but it seemed to Adam that this was simply making it all much worse . Dog sat at Adam 's feet . He had tried to help , chiefly by exhuming a bone he had buried four days earlier and dragging it to Adam 's feet , but all Adam had done was stare at it gloomily , and eventually Dog had taken it away and inhumed it once more . He had done all he could . “
138403	138415	138401	138401	Adam	401	” Adam turned . Three faces stared over the garden fence . “
138418	138424	138401	138401	Adam	401	” said Adam , disconsolately . “

138497	138619	138481	138481	We	3838	” said Brian . For an instant Adam 's mind swam with visions of circuses . Circuses were boring , once they were set up . You could see better stuff on television any day . But the setting up . . . Of course they 'd all go down there , and they 'd help them put up the tents , and wash the elephants , and the circus people would be so impressed with Adam 's natural rappore with animals such that , that night , Adam ( and Dog , the World 's Most Famous Performing Mongrel ) would lead the elephants into the circus ring and ... It was no good . He shook his head sadly . "
