952	968	969	969	he	146	" I 'm cold standing out here . I am going inside to lie down , ”
1027	1041	1022	1022	he	146	“ The stream is cold and I am going inside to cook it . ”
1073	1084	1065	1065	He	146	" His speech is growing less distinct than it was , ”
1088	1122	1065	1065	He	146	“ We had difficulty enough teaching him to communicate . He is not an efficient mechanism , this Manlegs . You may have noticed that he is moving more slowly than he did . ”
1123	1146	1085	1085	Quequo	148	“ I had noticed it , Mother . He complains about it himself . Increasingly he mentions this phenomenon he calls pain . "
1147	1198	1065	1065	He	146	" It is difficult to exchange ideas with Earthlegs because their vocabularies are so limited and their voice range minimal , but I gather from what he was trying to tell me the other night that if he were a utod he would now be almost a thousand years old . ”
1199	1211	1065	1065	He	146	" Then we must expect he will soon evolve into the carrion "
1231	1474	1475	1475	Mother	150	" This conversation was carried on in the utodian language , while Snok Snok lay back against the huge symmetrical grorgs climbed about them , licking and pouncing . The stench , encouraged by the sun 's mild shine , was gorgeous . Their droppings , released into the mud , supplied valuable oils which seeped into their hides , making them soft . Snok Snok Karn was already a large utod , a strapping offspring of the dominant species of the lumbering world of Dapdrof . He was , in fact , adult now , although still neuter : and in his mind 's lazy eye he saw himself as a male for the next few decades anyhow . He could change sex when Dapdrof changed suns ; for that event , the periodical entropic solar orbital disestablishment , Snok Snok was well prepared . Most of his lengthy childhood had been taken up with disciplines preparing him for this event . Quequo had been very good on disciplines and on mindsuckle ; secluded from the world as the two of them were here with Manlegs Ainson , she had given them all of her massive and maternal concentration . Languidly , he deretracted a limb , scooped up a mass of slime and mud , and walloped it over his chest . Then , recollecting his manners , he hastily sloshed some of the mixture over his mother 's back . “
1486	1522	1478	1478	you	150	” Snok Snok asked , retracting the limb into the smooth wall of his flank . Manlegs was what they called Aylmer ; esod was a convenient way of squeaking about entropic solar orbital disestablishmentism . “
1537	1545	1478	1478	you	150	” Quequo said , blinking through mud . "
1608	1609	1594	1594	they	351	" “
1622	1859	1860	1860	Mother	150	” When she did not bother to answer , for the grorgs were trotting actively up and down her spine , Snok Snok lay and thought about that time , not far off now , when Dapdrof would leave its present sun , Saffron Smiler , for Yellow Scowler . That would be a hard period , and he would need to be male and fierce and tough . Then eventually would come Welcome White , the happy star , the sun beneath which he had been born ( and which accounted for his could afford to take on the cares and joys of motherhood , and rear and train a son just like himself . Ah , but life was wonderful when you thought deeply about it . The facts of esod might seem prosaic to some , but to Snok Snok , though he was only a simple country boy ( simply reared , too , without any notions about joining the priesthood and sailing out into the star - realms ) , there was a glory about nature . Even the sun 's warmth that filled his eight - hundred - and - fifty - pound bulk held a poetry incapable of paraphrase . He heaved himself to one side and excreted into the midden , as a small tribute to his mother . Do to others as you would be dung by . "

1936	1968	1925	1925	Mother	150	” She hesitated before giving him her answer ; it was a wretchedly difficult answer , yet only through it lay an understanding of the world of affairs . She said : “
1977	1984	2022	2022	you	150	" He brushed the remark aside . “
2006	2007	2022	2022	you	150	” "

2069	2147	2057	2057	you	150	" The first encounter between utod and man occurred ten years after the birth of Snok Snok . As Snok Snok said , this encounter was staged on the planet his race called Grudgrodd . Had it happened on a different planet , had different protagonists been involved , the outcome of the whole matter might have been other than it was . Had someone- But there is little point in embarking on conditionals . There are no “
2149	2360	2361	2361	I	0	” in history , only in the minds of observers reviewing it , and for all the progress we make , nobody has proved that chance is other than a statistical delusion invented by man . We can only say that events between man and utod fell out in such and such a way . This narrative will chronicle these events with as little comment as possible , leaving the reader on his honor to remember that what Quequo said applies as much to man as to aliens : truths arrive in as many forms as lies . Grudgrodd looked tolerable enough to the first utods who inspected it . Autodian star - realm ark had landed in a wide valley , inhospitable , rocky , cold , and covered with knee - high thistles for the greater part of its length , but nevertheless closely resembling some of the benighted spots one happened on in the northern hemisphere of Dapdrof . A pair of grorgs were sent out through the hatch , to return in half an hour intact and breathing heavily . Odds were the place was habitable . Part .. the Sacred Cosmopolitan was induced to excrete out of the hatch in the universal gesture of fertility . "
2368	2375	2057	2057	you	150	" he said . The utodian for "
2378	2558	2057	2057	you	150	” was Grudgrodd ( as far as an atonal grunt can be rendered at all into terrestrial script ) , and from then on the planet was known as Grudgrodd . Still inclined to protest , the Cosmopolitan stepped out , followed by his three Politans , and the planet was claimed as an appendage of the Triple Suns . Four priestlings scurried busily about , clearing a circle in the thistles on the edge of the river . With all their six limbs deretracted , they worked swiftly , two of them scooping soil out of the circle and then allowing the water to trickle in from one side , while the other two trod the resulting mud into a rich treacle . Watching the work abstractedly with his rear eyes , the Cosmopolitan stood on the edge of the growing crater and argued as strongly as ever a utod could on the rights and wrongs of landing on a planet not of the Triple Suns . As strongly as they could , the three Politans argued back . “
2566	2571	2361	2361	I	0	” said the Cosmopolitan . “
2591	2619	2573	2577	children of the Triple Suns	360	” He extended a limb upward , where a large mauve globe as big as an ammp fruit peered coldly at them over a bank of cloud . "
2668	2674	2657	2658	an alien	365	” The first Politan said , “
2718	2719	2723	2723	you	363	” "
2729	2734	2723	2723	you	363	” the Cosmopolitan said . “
2775	2776	2777	2777	I	0	” "
2791	2826	2789	2789	Cosmopolitan	160	” said the second Politan . He had the heavy grayish - green skin of one born while an esod was actually taking place , and was perhaps the easiestgoing of all the priesthood . “
2955	2990	2991	2991	He	1692	" Let us ask no more , friend . I just observed that it seemed a bit unholy of us . I did n't mean any criticism . But we are setting a precedent . ”
3013	3092	3001	3003	the third Politan	376	“ I agree with every word you say , Cosmopolitan . But we do not know if we are setting a precedent . Our history is so long that it may be that many and many a crew branched out into the star - realm and there , on some far planet , set up a new swamp to the glory of utodammp . Why , if we look around , we may even find utods established here . ”
3093	3112	3114	3115	the Cosmopolitan	1692	" You persuade me utterly ; in the Revolution Age , such a thing could easily have happened , ”
3137	3155	3127	3127	he	1692	“ I pronounce all this to be land belonging to the Triple Suns . Let defecation commence . "
3333	3340	3342	3343	the Cosmopolitan	160	“ We need n't have worried , ”
3346	3384	3342	3343	the Cosmopolitan	160	“ The Triple Suns are still shining on us here . We need n't hurry back at all . Perhaps at the end of the week we 'll plant a few ammp seeds and then move homeward . ”
3385	3397	3399	3401	the third Politan	376	" ... or at the end of the week after next , ”
3481	3483	3473	3473	He	376	“ yield "
3833	3844	3852	3852	he	376	" I suggest that a life - form is approaching , "
3894	3905	3907	3909	the first Politan	406	“ How interesting . They are larger than we are , ”
3969	3983	3985	3986	the Cosmopolitan	1692	" If they make their own light , they must be fairly intelligent , ”
3988	4012	3985	3986	the Cosmopolitan	1692	“ Which do you think the life - forms are — the two chunky objects with eyes , or the four thin things ? ”
4013	4022	4024	4025	a priestling	409	" Perhaps the thin things are their grorgs , "
4027	4039	4041	4042	the Cosmopolitan	1692	" It would be only polite to get out and see , "
4082	4086	4088	4090	the second Politan	1705	" How delightful ! ”
4097	4111	4088	4090	the second Politan	1705	“ I do believe they are trying in their primitive way to communicate ! ”
4113	4120	4122	4124	the third Politan	376	“ What fortune that we came ! ”
4140	4145	4147	4150	two of the priestlings	416	“ Greetings , creatures ! ”
4240	4255	4256	4256	he	165	“ Do you wish me to take what you are saying seriously , Ainson ? ”
4259	4269	4256	4256	he	165	“ Or are you merely trying to delay takeoff ? ”
4304	4346	4286	4287	the Almighty	421	“ The two creatures we captured last night have definitely attempted to communicate with me , sir . Under space exploration definitions , anything that attempts to communicate with a man must be regarded as at least subhuman until proved otherwise . "
4347	4355	4356	4357	Explorer Phipps	167	" That is so , Captain Bargerone , "
4374	4391	4392	4393	the Captain	424	“ You do not need to assure me of the truth of platitudes , Mr. Phipps , "
4396	4430	4392	4393	the Captain	424	“ I merely question what you mean by ' attempt to communicate . ' No doubt when you threw the creatures cabbage the act might have been interpreted as an attempt to communicate . ”
4431	4443	4444	4444	Ainson	166	“ The creatures did not throw me a cabbage , sir , "
4447	4463	4444	4444	Ainson	166	“ They stood quietly on the other side of the bars and spoke to me . ”
4481	4499	4465	4466	The Captain	424	" Spoke , Mr. Ainson ? In an Earth language ? In Portuguese , or perhaps Swahili ? ”
4500	4537	4392	4393	the Captain	424	" In their own language , Captain Bargerone . A series of whistles , grunts , and squeaks often rising above audible level . Nevertheless , a language possibly a language vastly more complex than ours . ”
4538	4550	4551	4553	The Master Explorer	427	“ On what do you base that deduction , Mr. Ainson ? ”
4574	4727	4728	4729	Captain Bargerone	165	“ On observation . Our men surprised eight of those creatures , sir , and promptly shot six of them . You should have read the patrol report . The other two creatures were so stunned by surprise that they were easily netted and brought back here into the Mariestopes . In the circumstances , the preoccupation of any form of life would be to seek mercy , or release if possible . In other words , it would supplicate . Unfortunately , up till now we have met no other form of intelligent life in the pocket of the galaxy near Earth ; but all human races supplicate in the same way — by using gesture as well as verbal plea . These creatures do not use gesture ; their language must be so rich in nuance that they have no need for gesture , even when begging for their lives . ”
4736	4766	4728	4729	Captain Bargerone	165	“ Then you can be sure that they were not begging for their lives . Just what did they do , apart from whining as caged dogs would do ? ”
4767	4791	4551	4553	The Master Explorer	427	" I think you should come down and see them for yourself , sir . It might help you to see things differently . "
4792	4956	4957	4958	Bruce Ainson	166	“ I saw the dirty creatures last night and have no need to see them again . Of course , I recognize that they form a valuable discovery ; I said as much to the patrol leader . They will be off - loaded at the London Exozoo , Mr. Ainson , as soon as we get back to Earth , and then you can talk to them as much as you wish . But as I said in the first place , and as you know , it is time for us to leave this planet straightaway ; I can allow you no further time for exploration . Kindly remember this is a private company ship , not a Corps ship , and we have a timetable to keep to . We 've wasted a whole week on this miserable globe without finding a living thing larger than a mouse dropping , and I can not allow you another twelve hours here . "
4976	5045	4966	4966	Phipps	168	“ Then you must leave without me , sir . And without Phipps . Unfortunately neither of us was on the patrol last night , and it is essential that we investigate the spot where these creatures were captured . You must see that the whole point of the expedition will be lost if we have no idea of their habitat . Knowledge is more important than timetables . "
5046	5062	4964	4964	him	166	“ There is a war on , Mr. Ainson , and I have my orders . ”
5063	5086	5087	5088	The Captain	424	" Then you will have to leave without me , sir . I do n't know how the USGN will like that . ”
5098	5120	5087	5088	The Captain	424	" We leave in six hours , Mr. Ainson . What you and your subordinate do until then is your affair . ”
5121	5127	5129	5129	Ainson	166	" Thank you , sir , ”
5407	5425	5403	5404	The latter	452	“ Bargerone has n't given us much time , Bruce . What do you hope to find ? ”
5426	5456	5457	5457	He	166	" I want to examine the site where the creatures were captured . Of course , I would like to find something that would make Bargerone eat humble pie . ”
5471	5504	5457	5457	He	166	“ Quilter , you were in charge last night . Your trigger finger was a 16 bit itchy , was n't it ? Did you think you were in the Wild West ? ”
5515	5522	5525	5525	he	169	“ Captain complimented me this morning , "
5537	5571	5534	5534	Ainson	166	“ These beasts may not look intelligent , but if one is sensitive , one can feel a certain something about them . They show no panic , nor fear of any kind . ”
5572	5584	5585	5585	Phipps	168	" Could be as much a sign of stupidity as intelligence , ”
5588	5698	5585	5585	Phipps	168	“ Mm , possible , I suppose . All the same — Another thing , Gussie , that seems worth pursuing . Whatever the standing of these creatures may be , they do n't fit with the larger animals we 've discovered on other planets so far . Oh , I know we 've only found a couple of dozen planets harboring any sort of life - dash it , star travel is n't thirty years old yet . But it does seem as if light - gravity planets breed light spindly beings and heavy planets breed bulky compact beings . And these critters are exceptions to the rule . ”
5699	5724	5534	5534	Ainson	166	" I see what you mean . This world has not much more mass than Mars , yet our bag are built like rhinoceroses . "
5725	5740	5741	5741	Quilter	169	“ They were all wallowing in the mud like rhinos when we found them , ”
5744	5752	5741	5741	Quilter	169	“ How could they have any intelligence ? ”
5753	5781	5534	5534	Ainson	166	“ You should n't have shot them down like that . They must be rare , or we 'd have spotted some elsewhere on 12B before this . "
5782	5801	5802	5802	Quilter	169	" You do n't stop to think when you 're on the receiving end of a rhino charge , ”
5805	5810	5811	5811	They	455	" So I see . ”
6137	6154	6133	6133	Walthamstone	171	“ There 's the river . Just round the corner , and then we 're there . ”
6214	6217	6219	6219	Phipps	172	" It — "
6230	6239	6224	6224	They	473	“ It looks like one of the creatures . ”
6240	6253	6254	6254	Walthamstone	171	“ The mudhole where we caught them is just the other side , ”
6400	6406	6407	6407	Ainson	166	“ Do n't kill it , ”
6410	6421	6407	6407	Ainson	166	“ It 's wounded . It ca n't harm us . ”
6422	6435	6384	6384	his	169	“ We ca n't assume that . Let me finish it off . ”
6437	6511	6512	6512	Quilter	169	" I said not , Quilter . We 'll get it into the back of the overlander and take it to the ship ; we 'd better collect the dead ones too . Then they can be cut up and their anatomy studied . They 'd never forgive us on Earth if we lost such an opportunity . You and Walthamstone get the nets out of the lockers and haul the bodies up . "
6522	6526	6527	6527	Ainson	166	" Get moving , "
6608	6614	6615	6615	he	169	“ We sure stopped them ! ”
6651	6661	6662	6662	Walthamstone	171	“ Yeah . They 'd have got us otherwise , "
6665	6682	6662	6662	Walthamstone	171	" Two of them I shot myself . Must have been those two nearest to us . ”
6683	6691	6692	6692	Quilter	169	" I killed two of them too , ”
6695	6714	6692	6692	Quilter	169	“ They were all wallowing in the mud like rhinos . Boy , did they come at us ! ”
6715	6751	6662	6662	Walthamstone	171	“ Dirty things when you come to look at them . Ugly . Worse than anything we 've got on Earth . Are n't half glad we plugged them , are n't you , Quil ? ”
6752	6766	6795	6795	He	169	" It was us or them . We did n't have any choice . "
6767	6773	6774	6774	Walthamstone	171	" You 're right there . ”
6801	6809	6795	6795	He	169	“ We did n't have any choice . ”
6810	6824	6795	6795	He	169	“ What the hell good are they , I 'd like to know . ”
6825	6839	6795	6795	He	169	“ So'd I. We really stopped them , though , did n't we ? ”
6840	6847	6849	6849	Quilter	169	" It was us or them , ”
7195	7205	7179	7179	Buzzard	178	“ Got it , got it ! Transponential flight ! ”
9615	9629	9631	9634	Interior Rating Ginger Duffield	170	“ How much longer are we going to stand for this , fellows ? ”
9649	9716	9717	9717	His	626	“ This is a company ship , not a Corps ship , and we do n't have to put up with just any old treatment they care to give us . There 's nothing in regulations says we have to clean out alien tombs and bogs . I 'm downing tools till we get dirty pay , and I demand that all of you join me . ”
9730	9738	9717	9717	His	626	“ Yes , make the company pay ! ”
9739	9747	9793	9793	his	194	“ Who do they think we are ! ”
9748	9758	9717	9717	His	626	“ Let 'em clean out their own stink holes ! ”

9771	9781	9793	9793	his	194	" Get knotted , Duffield , you ruddy troublemaker . "
9782	9789	9793	9793	his	194	" What does the Sergeant say ? ”
9821	9885	9886	9886	Duffield	170	“ Duffield , I know your sort . You ought to be out on the Deep - Freeze Planet , helping to win the war . We do n't want none of your factory tactics here . Climb down off that box and let 's all get back to work . A bit of dirt wo n't barm your lily - white hands . "
9893	9957	9886	9886	Duffield	170	" I 'm not looking for any trouble , Sarge . Why should we do it , that 's all I say . Do n't know what dangerous disease is lurking in this little cesspit . We want danger money for working in it . Why should we risk our necks for the company ? What 's the company ever done for us ? ”
9976	10085	9967	9967	Duffield	170	“ What 're they going to do when we get home ? Why , they 're going to put this stinking alien box on show , and everyone 's going to come and have a look and a sniff at ten tubbies a time . They 're going to make their fortune out of this and out of those animals that lived in it . So why should n't we have our little bite now ? You just push 27 along to C Deck and bring the union man to see us , hey , Sarge , and keep that nose of yours out of trouble , hey ? ”
10086	10102	10103	10104	the Sergeant	1765	" You 're nothing but a flaming troublemaker , Duffield , that 's your trouble , "
10165	10180	10183	10183	them	434	" This is the last cleanout you guys are going to get from me , ”
10185	10230	10240	10240	he	169	“ At the end of this watch , I 'm joining the walkout , just to demonstrate my solidarity with the Space Corps . After this , as far as I 'm concerned , you can sleep in crap as deep as the Pacific . ”
10282	10312	10327	10327	He	638	“ Where the hell are you , Adrian ? Get down to the bloody spaceport as you were told . The Mariestopes is due in within half an hour . ”
10345	10364	10327	10327	He	638	“ Do n't be like that , Ralph . I 've got a local angle on the trip that "

12035	12118	11941	11942	The Explorer	720	“ Oh , they have intelligence , as has any mammal ; these are mammals . But their behavior or lack of behavior is baffling because we must not think anthropomorphically about them . Have they ethics , have they consciences ? Are they capable of being corrupted , as the Eskimo and Indians were ? Are they perhaps capable of corrupting us ? We have 32 are capable of seeing these rhinomen clearly . That is my feeling on the matter . "

12146	12263	11941	11942	The Explorer	720	“ No , no , no , I hardly think this is a problem I can discuss with a newspaper representative , but man places too much trust in his intellect ; what we need is a new way of feeling , a more reverent . . . I was getting somewhere with those two unhappy creatures we have captive - establishing trust , you know , after we had slaughtered their companions and taken them prisoner , and what is happening to them now ? They 're going to be a sideshow in the Exozoo . The Director , Sir Mihaly Pasztor , is an old friend of mine ; I shall complain to him . ”

He stood helpless there while a truck moved slowly by , buoyed along with cheers , cries , and exclamations from the onlookers . Through bars at the back of the truck , the two ETAs stared down on the onlookers . They made no sound . They were large and gray , beings at once forlorn and formidable . Their gaze rested on Bruce Ainson . They gave no sign of recognition . Suddenly chilled , he turned and began to worm his way through the press of wet raincoats . The ship was emptying and being emptied . Cranes dipped their great beaks into the ship 's vitals , coming up with nets full of cartons , boxes , crates , and canisters . Sewage lighters swarmed , sucking out the waste from the metal creature 's alimentary canal . The hull bled men in little gouts . The great whale Mariestopes was stranded and powerless , beached far from its starry native deeps . Walthamstone and Ginger Duffield followed Quilter to one of the exit ducts . Quilter was loaded down with gear and due to catch an ionosphere jet from another corner of the port to the U.S.A. in half an hour 's time . They paused on the lip of the ship and looked out quizzically , inhaling the strange - tasting air . “

12975	13042	12973	12973	mate	742	” he said . Explorer Phipps was home . He had embraced his parents and was hanging his coat in the hall . They stood behind him , managing to look discontented even while they smiled . Shabby , round - shouldered , they gave him the grumbling welcome he knew so well . They spoke in turn , two monologues that never made a dialogue . "
13058	13063	13064	13064	You	172	" his mother said . “

13374	13403	13357	13357	Gussie	172	” Phipps asked , and was glad to see his father 's chest , momentarily puffed , shrink again . His mother broke a tense silence by saying , “
13431	13489	13424	13424	you	755	” Little as the parental chatter enthralled Phipps , this sudden question discomforted him , as mother and father waited eagerly for his answer . He knew that stifling feeling of old . They wanted nothing of him , only that he be there to be spoken to . They wanted nothing from him but his life . "
13536	13582	13583	13583	I	0	” Familiarity again . He knew his father 's would - be piteous shake of the head , that particular pursing of his mother 's lips as if she nursed a lemon seed there . Before they could speak , he rose to his feet . "
13600	13770	13771	13771	You	760	” 35 chapter 5 Pasztor , Director of the London ExozOo , was a fine , willowy man without a gray hair on his head despite his fifty - three years . A Hungarian by birth , he had led an expedition into the submarine Antarctic by the time he was twentytwo , had gone on to set up the Tellus Zoological Dome on the asteroid Apollo in 2005 , and had written the most viewed technidrama of 2014 , An Iceberg for Icarus . Several years later he went on the First Charon Expedition , which charted and landed upon that then newly discovered planet of the solar system ; Charon refrigerates so unlovably some three thousand million miles beyond the orbit of Pluto that it earned itself the name of Deep - Freeze planet . Pasztor had given it that nickname . After these triumphs , Sir Mihaly Pasztor was appointed Director of the London Exozoo and was at present employed in offering Bruce Ainson a drink . "
13779	13790	13773	13773	I	0	" Bruce said , shaking his long head in reproof . “

13891	13947	13879	13879	you	760	" the Director said in a mild voice , while the bartender mixed him the cocktail known as a Trans- 36 ponential . They were at the reception being held in the hotel belonging to the Exozoo , where murals of exotic beasts stared down on a bracing mixture of bright uniforms and flowery dresses . “
13962	13966	13967	13967	You	760	” Ainson said . "
13980	13985	13967	13967	You	760	" said the Director . "

14166	14201	14154	14154	Enid	211	” Among the bright dresses , Enid Ainson 's hooded - cobra costume looked as sunny as an eclipse . She smiled , however , as she came up to her husband and Pasztor . “
14244	14245	14230	14230	You	760	" "
14268	14280	14281	14281	You	208	” She laughed , obviously pleased , but compelled to protest . “

14469	14483	14484	14484	You	211	” Ainson turned to his wife , laying a hand on her arm . "
14501	14502	14484	14484	You	211	" “
14513	14522	14484	14484	You	211	” She removed her arm from his grasp . “

14555	14574	14527	14527	you	0	” She looked at the canyons of his face and said , in the same humorously resigned tone , “
14617	14644	14645	14645	I	0	” Not making a graceful thing of it , Ainson left them . Pasztor cocked an eyebrow at Enid , and secured them a drink apiece . “

14728	14745	14726	14726	he	146	” . He detected her brief flush . She looked away from him as she spoke . “

14968	14969	14956	14956	Aylmer	146	” “

15006	15167	15004	15004	Bruce	166	” When the Master Explorer had settled the wrap about 38 his wife 's shoulders , Mihaly led them out of the hall by a side door . They walked along a carpeted corridor , downstairs , and out into the dusk . The zoo lay quiet , though one or two London starlings moved belatedly to bed among the trees , and from its heated pool a Rungsted 's sauropod raised its neck to gaze in dim wonder at their passage . Turning before they reached the Methane Mammal House , Pasztor led his companions to a new block constructed in the modern manner of sanded reinforced plastic blocks and strawed concrete with lead verticals . As they entered by a side door , lights came on . Reinforced curving glass separated them from the two ETAs . The creatures turned about as the lights came on , to watch the humans . Ainson made a halfhearted gesture reaction . "
15175	15179	15170	15170	they	793	” he said . “

15237	15339	15340	15340	You	802	” The visitors had an ample double cage , the two parts separated by a low door . At the back of one room was a wide low bed padded with plastic foam . Troughs filled with food and water lined one of the other walls . The ETAs stood in the center of the floor ; they had already amassed a fair amount of dirt about them . Three lizardlike animals scuttled across the floor and flung themselves onto the massive bodies of the ETAs . They scuttled for a fold of skin and disappeared . Ainson pointed toward them . "
15426	15427	15420	15420	I	0	" "
15435	15439	15447	15447	he	173	” Pasztor asked . “

15485	15502	15475	15475	He	173	" 39 Enid , who had been watching the captives intently , looked up and asked , “

15573	15611	15546	15546	God	213	” . The Master Explorer tucked his hands into the hip flounces of his uniform and regarded his wife . When he spoke , it was smolderingly , like a preacher from the elevation of a pulpit . "
15745	15746	15732	15732	they	818	” “
15757	15761	15732	15732	they	818	” Enid asked . “

15978	15995	15937	15937	we	815	” 40 Ainson brushed this aside with the gesture of a practical man cutting through sophisms . "

16578	16599	16571	16571	His	840	” It was not the remark to please Bruce Ainson . He decided he had had enough of the subject . "
16605	16609	16571	16571	His	840	" he said . “
16649	16681	16641	16641	you	832	” They shook hands with returning cordiality . Provoked by one of the bursts of mischief that insured he would never rise higher than his present sinecure , Sir Mihaly asked , “
16714	16729	16706	16706	you	844	” A tinge as of dusty brick mottled Bruce Ainson 's throat and jowls . “
16753	16758	16746	16746	I	0	” he said stiffly . “
16767	16819	16746	16746	I	0	” The shuttle on the district line climbed upward through a night punctuated by the city 's orchestra of lights . It clung dizzily to its thread of rail . Enid closed her eyes and wished she had swallowed an Antivom before they boarded ; she was not a good traveler . “
16826	16831	16746	16746	I	0	” her husband said . "
16839	16847	16837	16837	Bruce	166	" After a silence , Ainson said , “

16879	16880	16875	16875	you	0	” "
16893	16914	16884	16884	you	0	” She sighed , and the noise of the air flowing past the cab drowned the small sound she made . “
16950	17031	16944	16944	he	208	” High above outer London , the district shuttle decanted them onto the great curled lip of the Outflank Ring . Their section of the newly built structure was crowded , so that they preserved silence as they whirled toward the nonstop lane that would take them home . But once on the monobus , 42 their silence continued to cling . Neither felt comfortable with the other 's lack of speech , fearing unknown thoughts . Enid spoke first . "
17063	17081	17058	17058	you	848	” He patted her hand and smiled at her forgivingly , as one might to a child . “
17131	17183	17184	17184	I	0	" She stared ahead of her . She was not really disappointed ; she should have expected the answer she got . And even then , instead of showing anger , she found herself trying to be friendly with him , asking one of her silly little searched - for questions . "
17201	17202	17186	17186	you	848	" “
17244	17264	17294	17295	the Mariestopes	185	" She recognized a vagueness in his phraseology that he used when there was something he was unsure of . “
17270	17278	17279	17281	The wounded ETA	855	” He stared into the rushing night . “
17372	17394	17361	17361	someone	692	" Again she felt bis silence fall like a stone from his lips as he looked past her through the window . “
17403	17404	17395	17395	You	0	" “
17410	17428	17395	17395	You	0	” She thought about all the things that men saw and did and bore with apparent ease . “
17434	17438	17430	17430	you	0	” Ainson said . “
17450	17473	17430	17430	you	0	" They were sinking down to the local traffic level . His melancholy gaze rested on the darkness that concealed their home . “
17480	17562	17563	17563	My	0	” he exclaimed . 43 After the Ainsons had gone , Sir Mihaly Pasztor stood where he was , in a vacuity that occasionally merged into thought . He began to pace up and down , watched by the eyes of the two alien beings beyond the glass . Their glance finally slowed him ; he came to rest on the balls of his feet , balancing , swaying gently , regarding them with folded arms , and finally addressing them . “
17704	17765	17766	17769	One of the ETAs	868	“ In short , my dear and dung - stained charges , if you are civilized , then you need to be confronted by a properly civilized man . If you are more than animal , then it should not be too long before we understand each other . After that will be time for words to grow between us . ”
17927	17934	17935	17935	he	208	" To our way of thought , ”
17938	17954	17935	17935	he	208	“ civilization is reckoned as the distance man has placed between himself and his excreta . ”
17966	18003	17957	17958	the ETAs	184	“ We have no civilizations on Earth that are not firmly founded on an alphabet . Even the aborigine sketches his 44 fears and hopes on the rocks . But do you have fears and hopes ? ”
18029	18110	18111	18115	One of the lizard creatures	875	" It is impossible to imagine a creature larger than a flea without fears and hopes , or some such equivalent structure based on pain stimuli . Good feelings and bad feelings : they get us through life ; they are our experiences of the external world . Yet if I understand the report on the autopsy of one of your late friends , you experience no pain . How radically that must modify your experience of the external world . ”

Since we can only know it through our senses , we can never know it undiluted ; we can only know it as external - world - plus - senses . What is a street ? To a small boy , a whole world of mystery ; to a military strategist , a series of strong points and exposed positions ; to a lover , his beloved 's dwelling place ; to a prostitute , her place of business ; to an urban historian , a series of watermarks in time ; to an architect , a treaty drawn between art and necessity ; to a painter , an adventure in perspective and tone ; to a traveler , the location of drink and a warm bed ; to the oldest inhabitant , a monument to his past follies , hopes , and hearts ; to the motorist- "

Not that Rodney Walthamstone could help it , as his defense explained when the case came up . It was a compulsion of a not unusual sort in these modern days , when every other month saw the return of ships which had probed into the very depths of the cosmos . Ordinary mortals sailed on those terrible — and he used the word without intending hyperbole those terrible voyages , mortals , m'lud , like Rodney Walthamstone , upon whom space could not but have an overwhelming effect . This was well known , and had been designated Bestar 's syndrome ten years ago ( named after the celebrated psychodynamician , m'lud ) . Out in the cosmos , all the fundamental symbols and furnishings of men 's minds were lacking , brutally lacking . One did not have to agree with the French philosopher Deutch that cosmos and mind were the two opposed poles of the magnet of entirety to realize that space travel imposed a great strain on any man , and that he might return to Earth with a hunger for normality that could not be satisfied through legal channels . Granted that be so , then it was the law and not the mind of man that should be altered ; man had gone out into the infinite starry depths . It was up to the law to make itself somewhat less earthbound [ laughter ) . What symbol had more powerful hold over a man 's mind than a house , that symbol of home , of shelter from the hostile world , of civilization itself ? So , in this case of housebreaking , unfortunate though it was that the house owner had been coshed , the court should see that the not unheroic accused had merely been searching for a symbol . Of course , he admitted freely to having been slightly under the influence of drink at the same time , but Bestar 's syndrome allowed The judge , allowing that the defense had a point , said he was nevertheless tired of space ratings who came back to Earth and treated England as if it were a bit of the undeveloped cosmos . Thirty days behind bars might convince 46 the prisoner that there was a considerable difference between the two . The court adjourned for lunch , and a Miss Florence Walthamstone was led weeping from the court into the nearest public house . "

He had worked under Pasztor long ago - many moons before he had had trouble in walking downstairs in the morning — far below the icy cliffs of the Ross Ice Shelf .

20164	20329	20161	20161	her	225	“ My colleague , Mr. Borroughs , and I have now examined the space vehicle found on Clementina . While we are not qualified to give a technical report on it — you will be getting several technical reports on it from other sources , in any 49 case — we both were convinced that it was a vehicle developed for , if not by , the captive life - form . You will recall that eight of the life - forms were discovered close to the vehicle ; and the body of a dead one was disinterred within the vehicle itself ; nine bunks , or niches that by their shape and size are intended to serve as bunks , are observable within the vehicle . Because these bunks run in the direction we think of as vertically rather than horizontally , and are separated by what we now know to be fuel lines , they have not previously been recognized as bunks . "
20357	20396	20418	20418	his	220	" For instance , we now have to ask ourselves , supposing we consider it established that the life - form has developed space travel : Can space travel be regarded as a priori proof of superior intelligence ? "
20397	20413	20418	20418	his	220	" That is the most penetrating question I have heard asked in the last decade , "
20431	20569	20418	20418	his	220	“ If it were posed to the masses , they would give you but one answer , or should I rather say that their many answers would take but one form . They would render an affirmative . We who are here may reckon ourselves more enlightened and would perhaps choose as a more valid example of superior intelligence the works of the analytical philosophers , where logic flows unconfused with emotion . But the masses - and who perhaps among us in the final analysis is to gainsay them ? -would , if I may employ a colloquialism , plump for a product in which the hands as well as the mind had been employed . I do not doubt that among such a category of products the spaceship would appear to them the most outstanding . "

20615	20748	20608	20608	Wittgenbacher	220	“ But this does raise another question . Suppose that , having granted this life - form , so unaesthetically unhygienic in many of its habits , superior intelligence ; suppose we later discover its planet of origin , and then perceive that its — um , its space - going ability is as much governed by instinctual behavior as is the ocean - going ability of our northern fur seals . Perhaps you will correct me if I am in error , Sir Mihaly , but I believe that the Arctocephalus ursinus , the bear seal , makes a winter migration 50 of many thousands of miles from the Bering Sea down to the shores of Mexico , where I have seen them myself when swimming in the Gulf of California .

He was a small stocky man , with a screw of gray hair rising from the middle of his forehead and a pugnacious expression . He had the reputation of being a sound and imaginative scholar , and offset it with some of the nattiest vests in London University . His present one , negotiating a considerable stretch of abdomen , was of antique brocade with a pattern of purple emperor butterflies chasing themselves about the buttons . “

21420	21497	21410	21411	Wilfred Brebner	231	" First I 'll make a few general remarks . Our visitors , these fat chaps from Clementina , do n't understand what writing is . They have no script . That does n't mean anything with regard to their language - many African Negro languages were only reduced to writing by white missionaries . Efik and Yoruba were two such languages of the Sudanic language group ; almost unused languages now , I 'd say . “
21588	21797	21804	21805	the statistician	971	" I am certain that our fat friends have a language and you gents of the press can quote me there , if you like . You 've only got to listen to them snorting together . And it is n't all snorts . We 've now analyzed it from tapes and have sorted out five hundred different sounds — though it may be that many of these sounds are the same sound delivered at a different pitch . You may know that there are terrestrial linguistic systems such as - er , Siamese and Cantonese , which employ a number of acoustic pitches . And we can expect 52 maybe more pitches with these fellows , who obviously range very freely over the sound spectrum . mentrum than somewhere about 23,000 a second , and this decreases with age . We have found that these chaps can go twice that , just as a terrestrial bat or a Rungstedian cat can . So one problem is that if we are to converse with them , we must get them to stay within our wavelength . For all we know , that may mean they would have to invent a sort of pidgin language that we could understand . ”
21798	21802	21804	21805	the statistician	971	“ I protest , "
21824	21839	21818	21818	his	971	“ You are now inferring , surely , that we are inferior to them . ”
21840	21884	21885	21886	Mr. Brebner	234	“ I 'm saying nothing of the kind . I 'm saying that their range of sound is very much greater than ours . Now Mr. Brebner here is going to give us a few of the phonemes that we have provisionally identified . ”
21947	21964	21965	21965	he	234	“ The dissections on the dead aliens have told us quite a lot about their anatomy , "
21968	22023	21965	21965	he	234	“ If you have read the rather lengthy report , you will know that our friends have three distinct classes of apertures through which they produce their characteristic noises . All these noises appear to contribute to their language , or we assume they do , just as we assume they have a language . “
22066	22127	21965	21965	he	234	" Secondly , our friends have six breathing vents , three on either side of their body , and situated above their six limbs . At present we refer to these as the nostrils . They are labiate apertures and although unconnected to any vocal chords — as is the mouth — these nostrils produce a wide range of sounds . “
22148	22233	21965	21965	he	234	“ Their form of speech consists of sound transmitted through all these apertures , either in turn , or any two together , or all three classes together , or all eight apertures together . You will see , then , that the few sounds I am now going to give you as examples are limited to the less complex ones . 53 Tape recordings of the whole range are of course available , but are not in a very manageable form as yet . “
22242	22271	21965	21965	he	234	" . To pronounce this word , Wilfred Brebner ran a light snore over the front of his throat and chased it with the little squeak represented here as "
22274	22301	21965	21965	he	234	” All printed forms of the alien language used throughout this book are similarly to be treated as mere approximations . Brebner continued with his exposition . “
22526	22614	22615	22615	We	975	“ The bucket of river mud also brought forth another word we can recognize . This sounds like WHIP - bwut - bwip ( a small whistle followed by two pouting labials ) . We have also heard it when grapefruit has been accepted , when porridge with sliced banana in it — a dish over which they show some enthusiasm has been accepted , and when Mike and I have been leaving in the evening . We take it therefore to be a sign of approval . “

22881	22949	22862	22862	Temple	219	“ Young man , a layman might indeed think those were the first steps . But my answer to that layman and to you is that such a catalog is only possible if the enemy - the alien is prepared to open up a conversation . These two buggers — I beg your pardon , madam — these two fellows have no interest in communicating with us . ”

22963	23079	23080	23081	The reporter	721	“ Your questions grow more foolish . You need common sense on a job like this . What damned good would a computer be ? It ca n't think , nor can it differentiate between two almost identical phonemes for us . All we need is time . You ca n't imagine - nor can your hypothetical layman — the difficulties that beset us , mainly because we are having to think in a realm where man has not had to think before . Ask yourself this : What is language ? The answer is : human speech . Therefore we are n't just doing research , we are inventing something new : nonhuman speech . ”
23115	23219	23097	23097	He	221	“ As you know , Doctor , I 'm new around here , so I hope you 'll appreciate I ask my questions in all innocence . My position is this . I 'm a skeptic . I know that we have investigated only three hundred planets in this universe , and I know that leaves a tidy few million to go , but I still hold that three hundred is a fair sampling . None of them have yielded any form of life half as intelligent as my Siamese cat . This suggests to me that man is unique in the universe . "
23220	23230	23231	23231	Temple	219	" It should be no stronger than a suggestion , ”
23234	23298	23231	23231	Temple	219	" Nor is it . Now , I do n't give a row of pins if there is no other form of intelligent life in the universe ; man has 55 7 the other hand , if some other intelligent form of human turns up elsewhere , then I 'll welcome it as readily as the next man - provided it behaves itself . “

24291	24374	24257	24257	Lattimore	221	" I do realize how unprecedented it all was . I 'm saying that it was unprecedented , and that therefore you should have been more thorough . Believe me , Mr. Ainson , I 've read photostats of the report on the expedition , and I 've scrutinized the photographs that were taken , and I have the impression that the whole thing was conducted more like a big - game hunt than an official expedition paid for with public money . "
24375	24424	24272	24272	he	166	" I was not responsible for the shooting of the six ETAs . A patrol ran into them , coming back to the ship late . It went to investigate the aliens ; they attacked and were shot in self - defense . You should reread the reports . "
24426	24455	24456	24456	Ainson	166	“ These hogs show no sign of being vicious . I do n't believe that they attacked the patrol . I think they were trying to run away . ”
24462	24496	24456	24456	Ainson	166	" I appeal to you , Mrs. Warhoon , is it reasonable to try and guess how these aliens behaved in their free state from a glance at their apathetic behavior in captivity ? ”
24514	24525	24526	24526	she	225	“ What other means have we for judging their behavior ? ”
24529	24550	24551	24551	Lattimore	237	“ You have the reports , that 's what . There is a full account there for you to study . "
24557	24587	24551	24551	Lattimore	237	“ What we have in the reports , Mr. Ainson , is a summary of what the leader of the patrol told you . Is he a reliable man ? ”
24588	24624	24644	24644	his	237	“ Reliable ? Yes , he is reliable enough . There is a war on in this country , you know , Mr. Lattimore , and we ca n't always choose the men we want . "

24692	24775	24776	24776	Lattimore	221	" All right , all right , Mr. Ainson . Obviously you have your answers . What I 'm saying is that you should have returned with a lot more answers . You see , you are something of a keyman here , are n't you ? You 're the Master Explorer . You were trained up to just this situation . I 'd say you have made it very difficult for all of us by producing inadequate or even conflicting data . ”
24785	24796	24797	24797	Ainson	166	“ The nature of the data is to be conflicting , "
24800	24855	24797	24797	Ainson	166	" Your job is to make sense of it , not to reject it . Nobody be forwarded to Captain Bargerone . Captain Bargerone was in charge of the whole thing , not I. Oh , and Quilter was the name of the fellow in charge of the patrol . I 've just remembered . ”
24862	24901	24856	24857	Gerald Bone	222	“ As you know , I 'm a novelist , Mr. Ainson . Perhaps in this distinguished company I should say ' only a novelist . ' But one thing has worried me about your part in this . “

At the same time , Sir Mihaly Pasztor put on a dinner jacket and went to meet the guest he had invited to dine at his flat . This was a month after the dismal meeting at the zoo when Bruce Ainson had received the intellectual equivalent of a flea in his ear . Since then , the situation could not be said to have improved . Dr. Bodley Temple had accumulated an impressive hoard of alien phonemes , none of which had a certain English equivalent . Lattimore had amplified in print the views he had expressed at the meeting . Gerald Bone - traitorously , thought Pasztor — had done a malicious little skit on the meeting for Punch . These were but pinpricks . The fact was there was no progress being made . There was no progress being made chiefly because the aliens , imprisoned in their hygienic cell , showed no interest in the humans , nor any wish to cooperate in any of the stunts the humans devised . This disobliging attitude had its effect on the research team trying to deal with them ; the increasing moroseness of its members became increasingly punctuated with bouts of self - pitying oration , as if , like a Communist millionaire , they felt impelled to explain a position of some delicacy . The general public , too , reacted adversely to the alien cold shoulder . The intelligent man in the street could have appreciated an intelligent alien , no matter what his shape , as a new distraction to compete with the world series , the grim news from Charon , where Brazil seemed to be winning the war , or the leaping taxes that were a natural concomitant to both war and TP travel . Gradually the lines that stood all day to see the aliens in the afternoon dwindled away ( after all , they did n't move about much , and they looked not so very different from terrestrial hippos , and you were n't allowed to throw nuts at them in case it turned out they really lived in skyscrapers back home ) , and people went back to their old routine of watching instead the Pinfold III primaritals , which indulged in a form of group intercourse every hour on the hour . Pasztor was , as it happened , thinking of intercourse as he ushered his guest , Mrs. Hilary Warhoon , into his modest dining closet ; or if not thinking of it in reviewing with a whimsical smile at his own weaknesses the fantasies with which he had indulged himself half an hour before Mrs. Warhoon 's arrival . But , no , she was not quite enchanting enough , and Mr. Warhoon by repute was too powerful and spiteful , and anyhow Sir Mihaly no longer had the zest necessary to carry off one of those illicit affairs - even though “
26054	26076	25488	25488	you	166	" was one of the more alluring words in the English language . She sat down at the table and sighed . "

26206	26289	26201	26201	you	0	” There were three globular table ovens standing on the table . As she began to speak , he opened the refrigerated drawers on his right and began to put their contents into the ovens to cook : Fera de Travers , the salmon of Lake Geneva , to begin with ; to be followed by eland steaks flown that morning from the farms of Kenya ; with , to add a touch of the exotic , fingerlips , the Venusian asparagus . “
26301	26311	26291	26291	I	0	” Mrs. Warhoon said , attacking a dry sherry , “
26420	26530	26413	26413	he	1058	" When you take any one quality by which we measure civilization , you will find it missing from various cultures . Take the whole question of crime . For over a century , we have recognized crime as a symptom of sickness or unhappiness . Once we recognized that in practice as well as theory , crime statistics dropped dramatically for the first time . But in many periods of high civilization , life imprisonment was customary ; heads fell like petals . Certainly kindness and understanding and mercy are not signs of civilization , any more than war and murder are signs of the lack of it . "
26549	26561	26567	26567	he	208	“ This argument is familiar to me from my undergraduate days , "
26572	26589	26590	26590	He	208	“ Yet still we cook our food and eat according to rules with carefully wrought utensils . ”
26595	26612	26613	26613	He	208	" Still we choose our vintages and exercise our judgments and our prejudices over that choice . ”
26624	26638	26613	26613	He	208	“ Still we sit together , male and female , and merely converse . "
26639	26789	26567	26567	he	208	" I 'm not denying , Mihaly , that you keep a good table , or that you have failed as yet to throw me on the floor . But this meal — and I cast no aspersions — is now an anachronism , and strongly disapproved of by a government pushing the new poison - free manmade foods and drinks . Besides , this lovely meal is the end product of a number of factors that have only a nodding acquaintance with true civility . I mean the fishers crouching in their boats , the farmers sweating through their grazing land , the barb in the mouth , the shot in the head , the chains of middlemen less tolerable than farmers or fishers , the organizations that prepare or can or pack , the transport firms , the financiers — Mihaly , you 're laughing at me ! ”
26790	26935	27070	27070	He	1062	" Ah , you 're talking of all this organization with such disapproval . I approve . Vive l'organisation ! And let me remind you that the new synthetic food plants are triumphs of organization . Last century , as you say , they did n't approve of prisons , but they had them , nevertheless ; this century we have become organized , and we do n't have prisons , but rehabilitation centers . Last century , indeed , they did n't approve of war , yet they had three bouncing big ones , in 1914 , in 1939 , and in 1969 ; this century we have become organized , and we hold our wars on Charon , the furthest planet , out 63 of harm 's way . If that 's not civilization , I accept it readily as a substitute . "
26936	26972	26613	26613	He	208	“ So we all do . But it may only be a substitute , man 's substitute . Notice that whatever we do , it is at someone else 's or something else 's expense . "
26973	26989	26567	26567	he	208	" I gratefully accept their sacrifice . How will you have your steak , Hilary ? ”
26990	27068	27070	27070	He	1062	“ Overdone , please . I get nervous about it being real blood and animal tissue . All I 'm trying to say is that our civilization may be built not on our best , but on our worst : on fearother people 's if not our own - or on greed . Can I pour you some more wine ? And perhaps another species may have empathy with , all other living things . Perhaps these aliens "
27235	27243	27244	27245	Mrs. Warhoon	225	" By the standards of another species , ”
27249	27285	27244	27245	Mrs. Warhoon	225	" our culture might merely seem like a sickness . It may be that sickness which prevents us from seeing how we ought to communicate with the aliens , rather than any shortcoming of theirs . ”
27286	27311	27244	27245	Mrs. Warhoon	225	“ It 's an interesting theory , Hilary . You may have a chance to turn it into practice on a large scale shortly . "
27312	27338	27244	27245	Mrs. Warhoon	225	" Oh , indeed ? You do n't mean that some other ship has found more aliens at large in the universe , do you ? ”
27339	27478	27479	27480	Mrs. Warhoon	225	" Nothing quite so fortunate as that . I received a long letter from Lattimore yesterday morning , which was partly why I invited you here this evening . The Americans , as you know , are very interested in our ETAs . We have had a constant stream of them to the Exozoo over the last month . They are convinced , and I am sure Lattimore has convinced them , that things are not being run as efficiently as they might be . Lattimore wrote to say that their new stellar exploration ship , Gansas , has been rerouted , though the 64 rerouting is not official yet . Its investigation of the Crab Nebula is postponed . Instead , it will be heading for Clementina , to search for the home planet of the ETAs . ”
27495	27498	27489	27489	her	225	“ What ? ”
27499	27555	27479	27480	Mrs. Warhoon	225	“ Lattimore will be on the flight in an advisory capacity . His meeting with you much impressed him , and he earnestly hopes that you will come along on the flight as chief cosmeclectic . He asked me to put in a good word for him before he gets in touch with you direct . ”
27570	27573	27574	27574	she	225	“ Goodness , ”
27590	27632	27633	27633	She	225	“ He says you will not be the only woman on the flight . He also gives a rough indication of the salary , which will be fabulous . You ought to go , Hilary . It 's a splendid opportunity . ”
27673	27703	27666	27666	His	1074	" Space ! You know I 've been no further abroad than Venus . You know it would wreck my marriage , Mihaly . Alfred would never forgive me . ”
27704	27720	27721	27721	Her	225	“ I 'm sorry . I understood your marriage was a marriage in name only . ”
27741	27828	27736	27736	She	225	" It does n't matter . I can't - or possibly will not - save it . To leave in the Gansas would make a clean break with the past . ... Thank goodness that in that sphere at least we are more civilized than our grandparents , and have no involved divorce laws . Should I go on the Gansas , Mihaly ? I should , should n't I ? You know there are few men I would as readily take advice from as you . "
27870	27907	27853	27853	He	1075	" You owe it to yourself , Hilary . You know it is not only a golden professional opportunity ; these days , we are not adult humans until we have faced ourselves in deep space . ”
27908	27944	27945	27945	She	225	“ Nuh - ah , Mihaly , I know your reputation , and on the techni you promised you would take me to the new play . Ought n't we to be on our way ? ”
28006	28023	28024	28024	she	225	“ I 'll go and put a new face on and prepare myself for the street , ”
28353	28360	28361	28361	she	225	“ Grr , you little carnivore ! ”
28768	28783	28784	28785	Mrs. Warhoon	225	" Walking here , I can hardly think of walking on a different planet , ”
28788	28801	28784	28785	Mrs. Warhoon	225	“ You certainly do n't get much sight of the universe here , ”
28812	28865	28866	28866	She	225	“ In another two or three centuries , man will have a different outlook on life and the rules by which he lives . He will have digested the universe into his art , architecture , customs , everything . As yet we 're adolescents . The city 's our savage playground . ”
28888	28920	28866	28866	She	225	“ It 's a place where we undergo perpetual initiation rites , ordeals by fire , crowds , and gas . We are n't mature enough to deal with your ETAs . ”
28977	29021	28950	28950	She	225	“ We started wrongly with those creatures , Mihaly , by making them adhere to our rules instead of studying theirs . Perhaps the Gansas will find more of them and we will have another chance to make contact , on their terms . "
29083	29255	29072	29072	his	219	" He was glad to get her to the theater . The play was a lively revival of the Cold War era , a nonmusical version of West Side Story , played in quaint preWorld War III costume . Both Pasztor and Mrs. Warhoon enjoyed it ; but her mind kept drifting back to the prospect of making vacuum with the Gansas , so that in the interval Pasztor threw himself into the free - for - all struggle around the theater bar rather than let her start another discussion . As they came out of the theater at the end of the play , she insisted that she must go home , and he competed with evening dresses and uniforms to cram her into one of the sinkers that rose to connect with the district shuttle . It had rained during their incarceration , clearing the city air somewhat . Drops of oily water splashed on them from the overhead rail ; still Mrs. Warhoon stuck bravely to her subject . "

29344	29345	29336	29336	you	1127	" “
29399	29423	29424	29424	I	0	" A man in astrogator 's uniform wedged behind her looked at her in sudden interest as he caught part of this remark . “
29435	29439	29424	29424	I	0	" Mihaly said . "
29443	29955	29424	29424	I	0	” She spoke the words dismissively , smiling , for he had finally got her to the doors of the sinker . She 4 68 touched his fingers and passed in . Pasztor had to fight not to be carried in as well . The doors closed ; the pellet was sucked up its tube . He watched its lights rise up to the level of the monobus rail . A globule of water splashed into his left eye . He turned and made his way home through emptying streets . Back in his flat over the Exozoo , he walked about aimlessly , thinking . Clearing the remains of their meal away , he swept cutlery and dishes from the dining table into the disposer , watching soft flame rise as they disintegrated . Then he resumed his pacing . Hilary had a grain of truth among her chaff , though earlier in the evening he had mentally labeled it sickness . Was n't truth a sickness man spent a lifetime seeking , just as a dog seeks the coarse grass that makes it vomit ? What was that epigram that he had trotted forth too often , about civilization being the distance man placed between himself and his excreta ? But it was nearer the truth to say that civilization was the distance man had placed between himself and everything else , for cradled deep in the concept of culture was the need for privacy . Once away from the hurly - burly of campfires , man invented rooms , barriers , behind which he developed his most characteristic practices . Meditation arose from mere abstraction , the individual arts arose from folkcrafts , love arose from sex , the concept of the individual arose from the tribe . But were the barriers valuable when one faced another culture ? And , again , might n't one of the difficulties with coming to grips with ETAs be that you hardly realized how strong a hold the mores of your own culture had on you ? It was , Pasztor thought , what might be called a Good Question , and , damn it , he would act on it now . He took the lift down to the ground floor . The Exozoo was dark about him ; only the simultaneously shrill and deep chuckle of a stone - cracker in the High - G House sent a shiver through the darkness . Man , shut in his culture , so anxious to imprison other animals with him ..... The two ETAs were seemingly asleep as he entered and the pallid lights came on . One of the lizard creatures took a flying leap back into the arm socket of its protector , but the big bulk did not stir . Pasztor moved through the side door and so came into the back of the cage . He unlocked the low barrier and walked up to the ETAs . They opened their eyes with what looked like infinite weariness . “
30019	30050	30006	30006	I	0	” Removing his trousers , squatting close to them , speaking gently , the Director of the Exozoo defecated onto the plastic floor . --- * cws61183 : : Chapter 8 “

30236	30367	30200	30200	you	1133	" As he spoke , the Sacred Cosmopolitan swiveled one of his heads to watch the thin life - form performing his natural function a few feet distant . He thought he recognized this thin life - form as one of those whose habits did not arouse disgust ; certainly he was not the one who came with an attachment that spurted a jet of cold water . Nor did he seem to be one of those who sat about with machines and two assistants ( no doubt they were this world 's equivalents of the priesthood ) so palpably trying to seduce him and the third Politan into communication . The thin life - form stood up and assembled the cloth over the lower part of his body . 71 “
30373	30378	30200	30200	you	1133	” the Politan exclaimed . “

30697	30767	30693	30693	I	0	" The alien life - form was standing nearby , watching . He was unable to maintain stillness for any length of time . Ignoring him , the Cosmopolitan began to speak cautiously , for he knew on what dangerous ground he trod . When one of his grorgs began to crawl under his belly , he slapped it back into position with a firmness that surprised even himself . "

30948	30991	30992	30993	My son	1151	" The Thinlegs was making signals with the mouth of his upper head , but they moved onto a higher audibility band , as was appropriate when discussing personal aspects , and ignored him from then on . The Sacred Cosmopolitan continued , “
31096	31097	31090	31090	they	1153	” “

31187	31225	31173	31173	Grudgrodd	11	" At this point , the life - form left them . As he disappeared , the light faded from their room . Quite uninterested in these minor phenomena , the Cosmopolitan continued to grope for words . “
31273	31274	31265	31265	you	1140	” “
31286	31310	31265	31265	you	1140	” the Politan asked , recalling the years when he had wallowed through the mazes of mindsuckle in the epoch of Welcome White . "

31347	31348	31337	31337	you	0	” “

31465	31466	31467	31467	Son	1145	” "
31486	31707	31467	31467	Son	1145	" Blug Lugug , who had been known for a hundred and eighty years as a third Politan , lapsed into a troubled silence . He was recalling more and more about bad . In the Revolution Age there had been bad . Even though the utods lived up to eleven hundred years , the Revolution Age was over three thousand generations ago ; yet its effects still lingered in everyday life on Dapdrof . At the beginning of that amazing age was born Manna Warun . It was significant that he had been hatched during a particularly cataclysmic entropic solar orbital disestablishment , the very esod , in fact , during which Dapdrof , changing from Saffron Smiler to Yellow Scowler , had lost its little moon , Woback , which now pursued its own eccentric course alone . Manna Warun had collected disciples and had left the traditional wallows and salads of his people . His band had moved to the wastes , there to spend many years refining and developing the ancient and traditional skills of the utods . Some of his group left him ; more joined . There they stayed for one hundred and seventy - five years , according to the old priestly histories . During that time , they created what Manna Warun called "
31712	31846	31467	31467	Son	1145	” They learned to make many more metals than their contemporaries knew of : hard metals , metals that could stretch thin and convey new forms of power along their lengths . The revolutionaries scorned to walk on their own six feet anymore . Now they rode in various sorts of cars that boasted a multitude of tumbling feet , or they flew in the air in other cars with wings . So said the old legends , though there was no doubt that they liked to lay it on a bit thick . But when the revolutionaries came back to their people to try and convert them to new doctrines , one feature of their lives in particular seemed strange . For the revolutionaries preached -- and dramatically practiced — what they called "
31849	31950	31467	31467	Son	1145	” The mass of the people ( if the old reports were to be believed ) were well disposed toward most of the proposed innovations . They were particularly pleased with the notion that the terms of motherhood might be eased by introducing 74 one or more systems that would abolish mindsuckle ; because for most of the fifty years of a utod 's childhood a mother was committed to mindsuckling her child on the complicated law and lore that were racial history and habit ; and the revolutionaries taught that this function might be handled by a mechanism . But “
31952	32047	31467	31467	Son	1145	” was something different altogether — a real revolution . Cleanliness was a difficult concept to grasp , if only because it attacked the very roots of being . It suggested that the warm mudbanks in which the utod had evolved might now be abandoned , that the wallows and dunghills and middens which were effective mud substitutes be abandoned , that the little parasite - devouring grorgs which were the traditional utodian companions be abandoned also . Manna and his disciples demonstrated that it was possible to live without all this needless luxury ( "
32049	32577	33001	33001	Creezeazs	253	" was another term they used for it ) . That cleanliness was evidence of progress . That in the modern revolutionary age , mud was bad . In this way , the revolutionaries had turned necessity into virtue . Working in the wastes , far away from the wallows and their sheltering ammps , mud and liquid had been scarce . In that austerity had been born their austere creed . They went further . Once he had started , Manna Warun . developed his theme , and attacked the established beliefs of the utods . In this he was aided by his chief disciple , Creezeazs . Creezeazs denied that the spirits of utods were born into the infant bodies from the ammps ; he denied that a carrion stage followed the corporeal stage . Or , rather , he could not gainsay that the bodily elements of the corporeal stage were absorbed into the mud and so drawn up again into the ammps , but he claimed that there was no similar transference for a spirit . He had no proof of this . It was just an emotional statement obviously aimed at getting the utods away from their natural habits ; yet he found those who believed him . Strange moral laws , prohibitions , inhibitions , began to grow up among the believers . But it could not be denied that they had power . The Cities of the Wastes to which they withdrew blazed with light in the dark . They cultivated the lands by strange methods , and drew strange fruit from them . They took to covering their casspu orifices . They changed from male to female at unprecedented rates , indulging themselves without breeding . All this and more they did . Yet it was not noticeable that they were exactly happier - not that they preached happiness , for their talk was more of duty and rights and of what was considered good or bad . 75 One great thing that the revolutionaries achieved in their cities stirred everyone 's imagination . The utods had many poetic qualities , as their vast fund of tales , epics , songs , chants , and werewhispers show . This side of them was touched when the revolutionaries built some of their machinery into an ancient ammp seed and drove it into and far beyond the skies . Manna Warun went in it . Since prememory days , before mindsuckle had made the races of utod what they were , the ammp seeds had been used for boats with which to sail to less crowded parts of Dapdrof . To sail to less crowded worlds had a sort of crazy appropriateness in it . Down in the wallows , the complicated nexus of old families began to feel that perhaps , after all , cleanliness had something . The fifteen worlds that circled about the six planets of the Home Cluster were all visible at various times to the naked eye , and hence were known and admired . To experience the thrill of visiting them might even be worth renouncing "
32580	33000	33001	33001	Creezeazs	253	" People , converts and pervents , began to trickle into the Cities of the Wastes . Then something odd happened . The word began to get about that Manna Warun was not all he had made himself out to be . It was said that he had often slid away to indulge himself in a secret wallow , for instance . Rumors spread thick and fast , and of course Manna was not there to deny them . As the ugly rumors grew , people wondered when Creezeazs would step forward and clear his leader 's name . At last , Creezeazs did step forward . Heavily , with tears in his eyes , speaking through his ockpu orifices only , he admitted that the stories circulating were true . Manna was a sinner , a tyrant , a mud bather . He had none of the virtues he demanded from others . In fact , though others -his friend and true disciple Creezeazs in particular - had done all in their power to stop him , Manna had gone to the bad . Now that the sad tale had emerged , there was nothing for it . Manna Warun must go . It was in the public interest . Nobody , of course , would be happy about it ; but there was such a thing as duty . People had a right to be protected , otherwise the good would be destroyed with the bad . Hardly a utod liked all this , although they saw Creezeaza 's point of view : Manna must be expelled . When the prophet returned from the stars , there was a reception committee waiting for him on the star - realm ark field . Before the ark landed , trouble broke out . A young utod , 76 whose shining but alarmingly cracked skin showed him to be a thoroughgoing Hygienic ( as the Corps of the Revolution were currently calling themselves ) , jumped up onto a box . He deretracted all his limbs and cried in a voice like a steam whistle that Creezeazs had been lying about Manna to serve his own ends . All who followed Creezeazs were traitors . At this moment , an unprecented event occurred , occurred even as the star - realm ark floated down from the skies : fighting broke out , and a utod with a sharp metal rod hastened Creezeazs onto the next stage of his utodammp cycle . “
33003	33009	33001	33001	Creezeazs	253	” gasped the third Politan . "
33018	33023	33012	33012	you	1162	” inquired the Cosmopolitan . "
33050	33061	33090	33090	I	0	” Blug Lugug said , coming back to the present . “
33108	33621	33622	33622	Wilfred	231	" Blug Lugug withdrew his limbs as much as possible . He shut his eyes , closed his orifices , and stretched himself until his external appearance was that of an enormous terrestrial sausage . This was his way of expressing priestly alarm . There was nothing in their situation to warrant the Cosmopolitan 's extreme language . True , it might become rather dull if they were kept here for any length of time — one needed a change of scenery every five years or so . And it was thoughtless the way the life - forms removed the signs of their fertility . But the life - forms showed evidence of goodwill : They supplied food , and soon learned not to bring items that were unwelcome . With time and patience , they might learn other useful things . On the other hand , there was this question of bad . It was indeed possible that the life - forms had the same sort of madness that existed in the Revolution Age on Dapdrof . Yet it was absurd to pretend that , however alien they might be , these Thinlegs did not have an equivalent evolutionary cycle to the utodammp cycle ; and this , being so fundamental , could only be something for which they would have a profound respect - in their own peculiar way , naturally . And there was this : The Revolution Age was a freak , a mere flash in the pan , lasting only for five hundred years , 2 . half a lifespan - out of the hundreds of millions of years of utodammp memory . It would seem rather a tall coincidence if the Thinlegs happened to be undergoing the same trouble at this moment . It was notorious that people who used violent words like bad and random victim , the very words of madness , were themselves verging on madness . And so the Sacred Cosmo politan .... At the very thought , the Politan quivered . His fondness for the Cosmopolitan was deepened by the fact that the older utod , during one of his female phases , had mothered him . Now he stood in need of consolation by the other members of his wallow ; clearly , it was time they were getting back to Dapdrof . That implied that they should speak with these aliens and hasten their return . The Cosmopolitan forbade communication - and quite rightly - on a point of etiquette ; but it began to look more and more as if something should be done . Perhaps , Blug Lugug thought , he could get one of the aliens on his own and try to convey some sense to it . It should n't be difficult ; he had memorized every sentence they had spoken in his presence since their arrival in the metal thing ; although it made no sense to him , it should be useful somehow . Pursing one of his ockpu orifices , he said , "
33639	33640	33637	33637	you	231	” “
33645	33650	33637	33637	you	231	" asked the Cosmopolitan . "
33656	34691	33653	33653	Thinlegs	251	” Sinking into a silence that held less cheer than usual , the third Politan began to think about the Revolution Age , in case it had any useful parallels with the present case to offer . With the death of Creezeazs and the return home of Manna Warun , more trouble had begun . This was when bad had flourished at its grandest . Quite a number of utods were thrust without goodwill into the next phase of their cycle . Manna , of course , returned from his flight in the star - realm ark very vexed to find how things had turned against him in the Cities of the Wastes . He became more extreme than before . His people were to forswear mud bathing entirely ; instead , water would be supplied to every dwelling . They were to keep their casspu orifices covered . Skin oils were forbidden . Greater industry was required . And so on . But the seeds of dissatisfaction had been well sown by Creezeazs and his followers , and more bloodshedding ensued . 78 Many people returned to their ancestral wallows , leaving the Cities of the Wastes slowly to fall into ruin while the inhabitants fought each other . Everyone regretted this , since there existed a genuine admiration for Manna which nothing could quench . In particular , his journey among the stars was widely discussed and praised . Much was known , even at that period , about the neighboring celestial bodies known as the Home Cluster , and particularly about the three suns , Welcome White , Saffron Smiler , and Yellow Scowler , around each of which Dapdrof revolved in turn as one esod followed another . These suns , and the other planets in the cluster , were as familiar — and as strange to the people as the Circumpolar Mountains in Dapdrof 's Northern Shunkshukkun . Whatever woes the Revolution Age had brought , it had brought the chance to investigate these other places . It was a chance the ordinary utod found he wanted . The Hygienics had control of all star - realm travel . The masses of the unconverted , pilgrimaging from all over the globe to the Cities of the Wastes , found they could partake in the new exploration of other worlds under one of two conditions . They could become converts to the harsh disciplines of Manna Warun , or they could mine the materials needed for building and fueling the engines of the arks . Most of them preferred to do the latter . Mining came easily ; had not the utod evolved from little burrowing creatures not unlike the Haprafruf Mud Mole ? They dug the ores willingly , and soon the whole process of building star arks became routine , almost as much a folk art as weaving , platting , or blishing . So , in turn , travel through the star - realms took on something of the same informality , particularly when it was discovered that the Triple Suns and their three near neighbors supported seven other worlds on which life could be lived almost as enjoyably as on Dapdrof . Then came a time when life was rather pleasant indeed on some of the other worlds : on Buskey , for instance , and Clabshub , where the utodammp system was quickly established . Meanwhile , the Hygienics split into rival sects , those that practiced retraction of all limbs , and those that deplored it as immoral . Finally the three nuclear Wars of Wise Deportment broke out , and the fair face of the home planet underwent a thoroughly unhygienic bombardment , the severity of which - destroying as it did so many miles of carefully tended forest and swamp land — actually changed climatic conditions for a period of about a century . 79 The resulting upheavals in the weather , followed by a chain of severe winters , concluded the wars in the most radical of ways , by converting into the carrion stage almost all the surviving Hygienics of whatever persuasion . Manna himself disappeared ; his end was never known for sure , although legend had it that a particularly fine ammp , growing in the midst of the ruins of the largest of the Cities of the Wastes , represented the next stage of his existence . Slowly , the old and more reasonable ways returned . Helped by utods returning from the other planets , the home population reestablished itself . Dams were rebuilt , swamps painstakingly restored , dunghills reintroduced on the traditional patterns , ammps replanted everywhere . The Cities of the Wastes were left to fall into decay . Nobody was interested anymore in the ethics of cleanliness . Law and ordure were restored . Yet at whatever expense it had been acquired , the industrial revolution had borne its fruits , and not all of them were permitted to die . The basic techniques necessary for maintaining star - realm travel passed to the ancient priesthood dedicated to maintaining the happiness of the people . The priesthood simplified practices already smoothed into quasi - ritual by habit and saw that these techniques were handed on from mother to son by mindsuckle , together with the rest of the racial lore . All that now lay three thousand generations and almost as many esods ago . Through the disciplines of mindsuckle , its outlines remained clear . In Blug Lugug 's brains , the memory of the hideous , perverted talk and teachings of Manna and the other Hygienics was vivid . He prided himself on being the filthiest and healthiest of his generation of priests . And he knew by the absurd phrases of moral condemnation the Cosmopolitan had uttered that the cleanliness inflicted on his old body by the Thinlegs was affecting his brain . It was time something was done . 80 chapter 9 It was an American sage back in the nineteenth century who coined the slogan since used so successfully on the wrappers of every Happy Hypersleep tablet : “
34702	34797	33653	33653	Thinlegs	251	” Thoreau certainly had a point when he observed that anxiety and even misery feed in the breasts of those often most concerned with putting up a brave show of happiness ; yet such is the constitution of human nature that the reverse holds equally true , and under conditions commonly regarded as most likely to create misery , a man may lead a life of quiet happiness . The gates of St. Albans Prison swung open and emitted the prison bus . It bowled out beneath the aluminum legend over the portal that read “
34804	35184	33653	33653	Thinlegs	251	” and headed for the region of the metropolis called The Gay Ghetto . Or so the area was most generally known . Its inhabitants called it The Knackers , or Joburg , or Wonderland , or Sucker City , or , indeed , any less savory name that occurred to them . The area had been established by a government enlightened enough to realize that some men , while being far from criminal in intent , are incapable of living within the exacting framework of civilization ; which is to say that they do not share the goals and incentives of the majority of their fellow beings ; which is to say that they see no point in working from ten till four day in and day out for the privilege of maintaining a woman in wedlock and x or n number of children . This body of men , which numbered 81 geniuses and neurotics in equal proportions ( frequently within the same anatomy ) , was allowed to settle within The Gay Ghetto , which — because it was unsupervised in any way by the forces of law - soon became the nesting ground of criminals also . Within the ruinous square mile of this human game reserve , a unique society formed ; it looked at the monstrous machinery of living that ground on beyond its walls with the same mixture of fear and moral disapproval with which the monstrous machinery regarded it . The prison taxi halted at the end of a steep brick street . The two released prisoners , Rodney Walthamstone and Tid , his ex - cellmate , climbed out . At once the taxi swerved and drove away , its door automatically sliding shut as it went . Walthamstone looked about him with unease . The drearily respectable dollhouses on either side of the street hunched their thin shoulders behind dog - soiled railings , averting their gaze from the strip of waste that began where they left off . Beyond the waste rose the wall of The Gay Ghetto . Some of the wall was wall ; some of it was formed from little old houses into which concrete had been poured until the little old houses were solid . "
35189	35193	33653	33653	Thinlegs	251	” Walthamstone asked . “
35214	35278	35209	35209	anybody	764	” The early sunshine , a snaggle - toothed old trickster , lay its transient gold and broken shadows across the uninviting flank of the Ghetto , of Joburg , of Paradise , of Bums ' Berg , of Queer Street , of Floppers . Tid started toward it , saw that Walthamstone hesitated , grasped his hand , and pulled him along . "
35299	35332	35333	35333	You	0	” Walthamstone said . He stood between the old life and the new , naturally fearful . Although Tid was his own age , Tid was so much more sure of himself . "
35340	35344	35333	35333	You	0	” Tid said . “
35354	35355	35347	35351	other blokes on the starship	1171	" “
35402	35412	35400	35400	Wal	259	” The grubby hand tightened on the grubby wrist . "
35428	35433	35420	35420	I	0	” Walthamstone said . 82 “
35442	35443	35420	35420	I	0	" “
35458	35459	35449	35449	She	1176	" "
35476	35799	35468	35468	I	0	" Giving up the grueling battle to express himself , Waltham- .. stone moved forward and was led like a lost soul toward the entrance to Avernus . But the ascent to this Avernus was not easy . No portals stood wide . They climbed over rubble and litter toward the solid houses . One of the houses had a door which creaked open when Tid pulled it . A tongue of sunlight licked in with their untrusting glances . Within , the solid concrete had been chipped into a sort of chimney with steps in the side . Without another word to his friend , Tid began to climb ; left with no option , Walthamstone followed . In the gloom on either side of him he saw tiny grottoes , some no bigger than open mouths ; and there were cysts and bubbles , and clots and blemishes , all of which had formed in the liquid concrete when it had first been poured down through the rafters and engulfed the house . The chimney brought them out to an upper window at the back . Tid gave a cheer and turned to help Walthamstone . They squatted on the windowsill . The ground sloped down from the sill , where it had been piled as an embankment for no other apparent purpose than to grow as fine a crop of cow parsley , tall grass , and elder as you could wish to see . This wildness was divided by paths , some of which ran around the upper windows of the solid houses , some of which sloped down into the Ghetto . Already people stirred there ; a child of seven ran naked , whooping from doorstep to doorstep with a newspaper hat on its head . Ancient facades grew down into the earth , tatty and grand with a patina of old dirt and new sun . "
35805	35881	35468	35468	I	0	” Tid cried . He ran down one of the tracks , a foam of flowers about his knees . Hesitating only a moment , Walthamstone ran down after his lover . Bruce Ainson assumed his coat with a fine air of desperation , while Enid stood at the other end of the hall , watching him with her hands clasped . He wanted her to start to speak , so that he could say , “
35887	35914	35468	35468	I	0	" but she had nothing else to say . He looked sideways at her , and a shaft of compassion pierced through his self - concern . “
35919	36284	36285	36285	I	0	” he said . She smiled , made a gesture . He closed the door and was gone . 83 Outside , he paid ten tubbies into the corner sinker and rose to the local traffic level . Abstractedly , he climbed into a moving chair that skied him up to the nonstop level and racked itself onto one of the robot monobuses . As he sped toward distant London , Bruce dwelled on the scene he had just made with Enid after the news in the paper hit him . Yes , he had behaved badly . He had behaved badly because he did not , in such a crisis , see the point of behaving well . One was as moral as one could be , as well intentioned , as well controlled , as intelligent , as innocent ; and then the flood of days brought down with it ( from some ghastly unseen headwaters , whence it had been traveling for unguessed time ) some vile fetid thing that had to be faced and survived . Why should one behave other than badly before such beastliness ? Now the mood , the shaky exhilaration of the mood . was passing . He had shed it on Enid . He would have to behave well before Mihaly . But did life have to be quite so vile a draught ? Dimly , he recognized one of the drives that had carried him through the years of study necessary to gain him his Master Explorer 's certificate . He had hoped to find a world , hiding beyond reach of sight of Earth in the dark light - years , a world of beings for whom diurnal existence was not such an encumbrance to the spirit . He wanted to know how it was done . Now it looked as if he 'd never have the chance again . Reaching the tremendous new Outflank Ring that circled high about outer London , Ainson changed onto a district level and headed for the quarter where Sir Mihaly Pasztor worked . Ten minutes later , he was standing impatiently before the Director 's secretary . “
36304	36305	36295	36296	Mr. Ainson	166	" “
36322	36392	36317	36317	you	0	” Pecking doubtfully at the nail of her little finger , the girl disappeared into the inner office . She emerged a minute later , standing aside without speaking to admit Ainson into Mihaly 's room . Ainson swept by her with irritation ; that was a girl he had always been careful to smile and nod at ; her answering show of friendliness had been nothing but pretense . “
36408	36442	36393	36393	I	0	” he said to the Director . Mihaly did not immediately assure his old friend that it was perfectly all right . He 84 maintained a steady pacing by the window and asked , "
36454	36466	36467	36467	I	0	" Ignoring the irrelevance of this last question , Ainson said , “
36479	36480	36470	36470	you	0	" “
36490	36506	36486	36486	you	0	” Pulling a newspaper from his pocket , Ainson dropped it on Pasztor 's desk . “
36541	36542	36543	36543	I	0	” "
36550	36551	36543	36543	I	0	" “
36593	36594	36595	36595	I	0	” "
36612	36613	36614	36614	I	0	" "
36624	36759	36760	36760	Mihaly	208	” Ainson stood there looking at his friend . Or was he really a friend ? Was it not a gross misuse of the term , just because they had been acquainted for a number of years ? He had admired the many sides of Pasztor 's character , had admired him for the success of his technidramas , had admired his leadership on the First Charon Expedition , had admired him for being a man of action . Now he saw more deeply ; he saw that this was merely a playboy of action , a dramatist 's idea of a man of action , an imitation that revealed its spuriousness at last by the calmness with which , from his safe seat at the Exozoo , he watched his friend 's discomfiture . “
36915	36931	36933	36933	you	1194	” Mihaly pulled a wry face , cupped an elbow , and rubbed his chin . “
36941	36942	36933	36933	you	1194	” “
36963	36965	36948	36948	you	1194	" 85 “
36990	37009	36981	36981	my	0	” As he went over to a pair of small doors set in the wall , he said , "
37061	37062	37068	37068	them	1197	” “
37075	37076	37068	37068	them	1197	” "
37155	37172	37178	37178	They	1197	” Unwilling though he was to be diverted from his own concerns , Ainson was startled . "
37219	37230	37212	37212	They	1197	” Pasztor poured himself a small whiskey and sipped it . “
37362	37367	37313	37313	Bruce	166	” others are doing . ”
37368	37395	37313	37313	Bruce	166	“ I went to see him last evening . He has stopped it . This afternoon the ETAs are being handed over to the Exobiology Department . ”
37396	37410	37313	37313	Bruce	166	" Exobiology ! Why , Mihaly , why ? There is a conspiracy ! "
37411	37494	37500	37500	Ainson	184	" With an optimism I personally regard as unfounded , the Minister reasons like this . Within a couple of months , the Gansas will have located more ETAs — a whole planet full of them , in fact . Many of the basic questions , such 86 as how far advanced the creatures are , will then be answered , and on the basis of those answers a new and much more effective attempt to communicate with them can be launched . ”
37543	37560	37540	37540	he	166	“ Supposing all this were so ; something more must lie behind the Minister 's move . "
37569	37595	37540	37540	he	166	" I inferred as much myself last evening . The Minister gave me a reason which , like it or not , we must accept . "
37596	37602	37540	37540	he	166	" What was the reason ? ”
37603	37705	37540	37540	he	166	“ The war . We are comfortable here ; we are apt to forget this crippling war with Brazil that has dragged on for so long . Brazil have captured Square 503 , and it looks as if our casualties have been higher than announced . What interests the government at present more than the possibility of talking with the ETAs is the possibility that they do not experience pain . If there is some substance circulating in their arteries that confers complete analgesia , then the government wants to know about it . It is obviously a potential war weapon . “
37730	37749	37750	37750	I	0	” Ainson rubbed his head . The war ! More insanity ! It had never entered his mind . “
37772	37784	37762	37762	they	1209	” he said . His voice sounded like a creaking door . “
37892	37907	37884	37884	I	0	” Ainson clenched a fist and shook it vigorously , close to his stomach . “
37930	38005	37925	37925	You	1211	“ Oh , do n't be foolish , Bruce ! Lattimore has nothing whatever to do with it . Ca n't you see this is the sort of bloody stupid thing that happens whenever something important 29 87 P . is involved ? It 's the people who have the power rather than the people who have the knowledge who get the ultimate say . Sometimes I really think mankind is a bit mad . ”
38006	38053	38056	38056	Pasztor	208	“ They 're all mad . Fancy not begging me to go on the Gansas ! I discovered these creatures , I know them ! The Gansas needs me ! You must do what you can , Mihaly , for the sake of an old friend . ”
38061	38105	38058	38058	his	208	" I can do nothing for you . I have explained why I myself am temporarily not very much in favor . You must do what you can for yourself , as we all must . Besides , there is a war on . "
38106	38174	38175	38175	Mihaly	208	“ Now you are using that same excuse ! People have all been against me , always . My father was . So 's my wife , my son — now you . I thought better of you , Mihaly . It 's a public disgrace if I 'm not on the Gansas when she hits vacuum , and I do n't know what I 'll do . "
38190	38214	38175	38175	Mihaly	208	" You did n't really expect better of me , Bruce . At heart , you know you never expect better of anybody . ”
38215	38243	38244	38244	He	208	" I certainly sha n't in future . You do n't wonder a man grows bitter . My God , what really is there to live for ! ”
38258	38265	38266	38266	he	208	“ I can see myself out , ”
38677	38685	38686	38686	Mihaly	208	“ Your father has gone , Aylmer , ”
38689	38703	38686	38686	Mihaly	208	" I recognized his voice . He sounded all overwrought , as usual . "
38724	38736	38711	38711	Aylmer	146	“ What was he after ? Anything to do with me ? ”
38737	38751	38752	38752	Their	1235	“ Not really . He wanted me to get him aboard the Gansas . ”
38771	38797	38766	38766	they	1235	" Like son , like father ! You did n't tell him , I hope , that I had come with an exactly similar request ? ”
38798	38814	38816	38816	he	146	“ Of course not . He had enough to be unhappy about for one day . ”
38825	38864	38819	38819	Mihaly	208	“ Now do n't be offended if I push you off fast , young man , but I have a lot of work to do . You are sure that you still want to join the Exploration Corps ? ”
38865	38909	38910	38910	Mihaly	268	" You know I do , Uncle Mihaly . I feel I can not stay on Earth anymore . My parents have made that impossible for me , at least for the present . I want to get out into space , away . ”
38950	38953	38970	38970	He	268	" away , "
38982	39061	38970	38970	He	268	“ These are the various papers you will need . A friend of mine , Bryant Lattimore of the USGN Flight Advice , 89 has explained things to David Pestalozzi , who will captain the Gansas on this run . Because your father is well known , it has been thought wiser to have you ship under an assumed name . Accordingly , you will be known as Samuel Melmoth . I hope you wo n't mind that . ”
39062	39089	39090	39090	He	268	“ Why should I mind ? I 'm very grateful for all you have done , and I have no particular fondness for my own name . ”
39150	39162	39163	39163	he	268	" What happened to that girl you were mixed up with ? ”
39166	39171	39163	39163	he	268	" Oh , her ! ”
39180	39187	39163	39163	he	268	“ She was a dead loss . ”
39188	39231	39232	39232	Aylmer	146	" I hope you 'll forgive my curiosity , Aylmer , but was she not the cause of your being turned out of your father 's house ? What did the two of you do that your father regarded as so unforgivable ? ”
39236	39246	39247	39247	Mihaly	268	" Come , you can tell me , surely , "
39253	39273	39247	39247	Mihaly	268	“ I am a broad - minded man , a man of the world , nothing like your father . ”
39277	39336	39337	39337	He	268	“ That 's funny , I always thought that in many ways you and Father were rather alike . For instance , you have this background of space travel ; and then neither of you likes the hygienic synthetic foods and you still eat old - fashioned foods , such as - well , bits of animal cooked . ”
39346	39399	39337	39337	He	268	“ But if it satisfies your curiosity , you may as well know that Father came in unexpectedly one night on his last leave when I had my girl on my bed . We were ... well , the sight nearly drove him off his nut ! Does it shock you too ? ”
39413	39495	39408	39408	his	268	“ My dear Aylmer , what shocks me is that I should appear to you like your father . This business of food - can't you see how generation by generation we are getting further and further divorced from nature ? This craving for synthetic food is one more instance of man 's denial of his animal nature . We are a mixture of animal and spirit , and to deny one side of our nature is to impoverish the other . ”
39496	39552	39408	39408	his	268	" The Stone Age men used the same argument , I daresay , to whoever started cooking their food . But we live in 90 You must see , Uncle , that we 've come too far for us to be able to argue any longer about what is ' natural and what is n't . ”
39553	39571	39403	39403	his	268	" Oh ? Why , then , are you disgusted about my eating ' bits of animal ? "
39572	39584	39408	39408	his	268	“ Because that is inherently~ Well , it 's just disgusting . ”
39585	39612	39408	39408	his	268	“ You 'd better go , Aylmer . I have the business of handing over my two aliens to the vivisectors . I wish you well . ”
39613	39630	39403	39403	his	268	“ Cheer up , Uncle , we 'll be bringing you lots more to experiment on ! ”
40001	40094	39998	39998	he	272	“ However surprising it may seem to those of us brought up in the cozy certainty of Einsteinian physics , the variable factor in the new Buzzardian equations proves to be the universe . Distance may be said to be annihilated . We recognize at last that distance is only a mathematical concept having no real existence in the Buzzardian universe . During TP flight , it is no longer possible to say that the universe surrounds the starship . More accurately , we should say that the starship surrounds the universe . ”

40289	40428	40286	40286	he	169	“ Day before I got to the ship , I got a letter from a guy who was with me on the Mariestopes , nice enough guy called Walthamstone , a Britisher . His first night Earthside , he got drunk and broke into a house . The cops caught him at it , and he got sent to jail . The way he put it , it sounds like he was a little psychotic at the time . Anyhow , in the jug he meets a pansy , and this pansy turns old Walthamstone the same way - works on him , you know , and turns him the same way ! So when they 're released , Wal goes to live with this queen in Ghettoyille . Now it seems they 're as good as married ! ”
40455	40490	40449	40450	Samuel Melmoth	270	“ That does n't seem very funny to me . We all need love of some sort , as your earlier stories 93 prove . I should have thought your friend deserved some pity . ”
40507	40568	40499	40499	He	169	" What are you trying to give me , Mac ? I 'm only laughing at the odd things that happen to people . And why should Wally need your goddamned pity ? He had a free choice , did n't he ? He could do what he liked when he came out of the jug , could n't he ? ”
40586	40596	40569	40569	Melmoth	270	" By what you say , he was seduced . "
40597	40666	40499	40499	He	169	" OK , OK , he was seduced . Now you tell me if we are n't all seduced at some time or other in some way or other . That 's when our principles are betrayed , is n't it ? But if our principles were stronger , then we would n't give in , would we ? So what happens to Wal is his own lookout . "
40667	40675	40569	40569	Melmoth	270	" But if he 'd had some friends ”
40676	40717	40569	40569	Melmoth	270	" It 's got nothing to do with friends or seducers or enemies or anything else . That 's what I 'm saying . It 's Wal 's own lookout . Anything that happens to us is our own responsibility . "

41019	41107	41011	41011	Lattimore	237	“ Quilter , you know why we are hitting vacuum . We intend to discover the home planet of the aliens that I believe are popularly known as rhinomen . My particular task is to formulate in advance some of the lines of approach we can use when we have uncovered this planet . Now I happened to flip through the crew lists and came on your name .

41108	41148	41011	41011	Lattimore	237	“ Sir , I was in the Exploration Corps then , sir . I was one of the men who actually came across the creatures . I shot three or four of them as they charged me . You see- “
41167	41211	41212	41212	You	169	” Quilter told his story in elaborate and elaborated detail , while Lattimore listened and gazed at the molybdenum crystals in which he was imprisoned and nodded his head and intermittently loosened a speck of dried mucus from inside one of his nostrils . "
41220	41249	41212	41212	You	169	” he asked , removing his spectacles to stare at Quilter . Quilter hesitated , weighed Lattimore up , and decided on the truth as he saw it . “
41272	41332	41334	41334	Quilter	169	” Lattimore smiled and resumed his spectacles . When he had dismissed the enlisted man , he pressed a bell and Mrs. Hilary Warhoon appeared . She looked very smart in a flared mock - male with recessed carnation paltroons ; the glint in her eyes showed how delighted she was to be loose in the big Buzzardian universe . "

42312	42559	42290	42290	you	237	” . Back on the strange planet called Earth , the third Politan called Blug Lugug was in a terrible state of mental confusion . He was strapped to a bench with a series of strong canvas straps that passed across what was left of his body . A number of wires and cables ran from machines that stood silent or gargled to themselves on one side of the room and climbed onto his body or into his various orifices . One cable in particular ran from one instrument in particular worked by one man in particular ; the man was dressed in a white sort of clothing , and when he moved a lever with his hand , something without meaning happened in the third Politan 's brain . This meaningless thing was more awful than anything the third Politan had known existed . He saw now how right the Sacred Cosmopolitan had been when he used the term bad to describe these Thinlegs . Here was bad bad bad : it reared up before him sturdy and strong and hygienic , and gnawed away his intelligence bit by bit . The something without meaning came again . A gulf 97 opened where there had been something growing , something delightful , memories or promises , who knows , but something is never to be replaced . One of the Thinlegs spoke . Mainly , in gasps , the Politan imitated what had been said : “
42573	42893	42564	42564	He	1298	” He still clung to the notion that when they realized he could imitate their speech , they would be intelligent enough to stop the things they were doing . Whatever they were doing , whatever inside their mad little minds they imagined they were doing , they were spoiling his chances of entering the carrion stage ; for already they had removed two of his limbs with a saw - from the corner of his misting eyes he watched the bin in which they had been deposited - and since there were no ammp trees here , the possibility of his continuing the cycles of being was remote . Nothingness confronted him . He cried an imitation of their words , but forgetting their limitations , pushed it high into his upper voice range . The sounds came distorted ; his ockpu orifices were clogged with tiny instruments like leeches . He needed comfort from the Sacred Cosmopolitan , his worshiped father - mother . But the Cosmopolitan had gone , no doubt to the same gradual dismemberment . The grorgs had gone ; he caught their almost supersonic cries answering him in lament from a distant part of the room . Then the something without meaning burst over him again , so that he could no longer hear — but what was it that he had been able to ... been able to what ? Something else had gone . In his dizziness , he saw that a new figure had joined the figures in white . In his dizziness , he thought he recognized the new figure . It was — or it was very like the figure that had performed the dung ritual a brief time ago . Now the figure cried something , and through the growing dizziness the Politan tried to cry the same thing back , to show it had recognized him : "
42897	43033	42564	42564	He	1298	” But the Thinlegs , if it was that specific one , gave no sign of recognition . He covered the front part of his upper head with his hands and went fast from the room , almost as > Str6 € ifThe something without meaning came again , and the white figures all looked eagerly at their instruments . Tipped far back until his toes were level with his head , the Director of the Exozoo lay in his therapad and sucked a glucose mixture through a nipple . He was being calmed 98 by a young man , now a member of the Exploration Corps with an Explorer 's certificate , who had once trained under him at the zoo . Gussie Phipps , who had flown in from Macao , offered comfort . "

43677	44671	43675	43675	Gussie	172	” he said . He began to technivise the police , while Enid wept in a businesslike way behind him . Bruce Ainson was already a fair distance beyond the reach of Earth police . On the day after the Gansas was ejected into space , a much less publicized flight began . Blasting from a small operational spaceport on the east coast of England , a systemship started its long haul across the ecliptic . Systemships were an altogether different sort of spaceship from the starships . They carried no TP drive . They fueled on ions , consuming most of their bulk as they traveled . They were built for duties within the solar system only , and most of them that left Britain nowadays were military craft . The I.S.Brunner was no exception . It was a trooper , packed to the hull with reinforcements for the Anglo - Brazilian war on Charon . Among those reinforcements was an aging and troubled nonentity named B. Ainson , who had been mustered as a clerk . That sullen outcast of the solar family , Charon , known generally to soldiers as the Deep - Freeze Planet , had been discovered telescopically by the Wilkins - Pressman Lunar Observatory almost two decades before it was visited by man . The First Charon Expedition ( on which was a brilliant young Hungarian dramatist and biologist named Mihaly Pasztor ) discovered it to be the father of all billiard balls , a globe some three thousand miles in diameter ( 3007.558 miles , according to the latest edition of the Brazilian Military Manual , 3009.657 miles according to its British equivalent ) . This globe was without feature , its surface smooth in texture , white in color , slippery , and almost without chemical prop- 100 erties . It was hard , but not extremely hard . It could be bored into with high - speed drills . To say that Charon had no atmosphere was inaccurate . The smooth white surface was the atmosphere , frozen out over the long and unspeakably tedious aeons during which Charon , a traveling morgue without benefit of bones , trundled its bulk about its orbit , connected by what hardly seemed more than coincidence with a first - magnitude star called Sol . When the atmosphere was dug and analyzed , it was found to consist of a mixture of inert gases packed together into a form unknown to and unreproducible in Earth 's laboratories . Somewhere below this surface , seismographic reports indicated , was the real Charon : a rocky and pulseless heart two thousand miles across . The Deep - Freeze Planet was an ideal place on which to hold wars . Despite their excellent effect on trade , wars have a deleterious effect on the human body ; so they became , during the second decade of the twenty - first century , codified , regulated , umpired , as much subject to skill as a baseball game or to law as to a judge 's table talk . Because Earth was very crowded , wars were banished to Charon . There the globe had been marked out with tremendous lines of latitude and longitude , like a celestial checkerboard . Earth was by no means peacefully inclined . In consequence , there were frequently waiting lists for space on Charon , the lists consisting mainly of belligerent nations who wished was slightly better . The Anglo - Brazilian war occupied Sectors and had been dragging on since the year 1999 . A Contained Conflict , it was called . The rules of Contained Conflict were many and involved . For instance , the weapons of destruction were rigidly defined . And certain highly qualified social ranks — who might bring their side unfair advantages were forbidden on Charon . Penalties for breaking such rules were very high . And , for all the precautions that were taken , casualties among combatants were also high . In consequence , the flower of English youth , to say nothing of blooms of a blowsier age , was needed on Charon ; Bruce Ainson had taken advantage of that fact to enlist the public eye . A century earlier , he would probably have joined the Foreign Legion . As the little ion - driven trooper carried him now over 101 the ten light - hours that separated Earth and Charon , he might , had he known of it , have reflected with contempt on Sir Mihaly Pasztor 's glib remark that the amount of thought in a man 's head is in inverse proportion to the amount of sun outside it . He might have so reflected , if only the Brunner permitted reflection among the men packed between its decks head to tail ; but Ainson , together with all his companions , went out to the Deep - Freeze Planet in deep freeze . chapter 11 One of the ways — if you were an intellectual- of proving you were not an intellectual was to stroll up and down the scanning deck with the sleeves of your tunic rolled untidily to the elbow . You put one of the big new corky mescahales between your lips , and you strolled up and down laughing heartily at your own jokes or at those of your companion . That way , the enlisted men who came up here for a gaze at the universe could see for themselves that you were human . The faulty ingredient in this prescription , Lattimore thought , was his current companion , Marcel Gleet , the Second Navigation Officer . It would have constituted a major solecism , almost a solar solecism , to have laughed at what Gleet said . Gleet was wedded to seriousness , and the marriage was much like a funeral . "
44679	44684	43675	43675	Gussie	172	” he was saying , “
44751	44799	44734	44734	he	288	” One certainly could n't laugh at that , Lattimore thought , though there were several crew members about on the deck , not a few of them laughing — mainly at Mrs. Warhoon 's notice , which was pinned conspicuously to the main bulletin board . 103 “
44810	44814	44734	44734	he	288	" Gleet continued , "
44868	44952	44991	44991	they	1316	" At least a chuckle of agreement might be inserted there . Gleet continued his discourse , but the chime of a watch bell reminded him of the reason for his coming up to the scanning deck , and he moved away in the direction of the navigation bay . Lattimore turned to one of the deep oval ports , and gazed out through the hull of the ship while he listened to the comments of a group of three men behind him . “
44965	44976	44962	44962	I	0	" one of them exclaimed , reading from the announcement . “
45002	45009	44991	44991	they	1316	” said one of his companions . "
45033	45038	45039	45039	I	0	” the third said . “
45052	45290	45039	45039	I	0	" said the first . Lattimore nodded to his ghostly reflection as the ancient form of badinage by insult ran its predictable course . He often wondered at that accepted method of verbal assault which passed for wit ; no doubt it was a way of sublimating a man 's hatred for his fellows ; what else could it be ? He was not at all perturbed at the comments passed on Mrs. Warhoon 's notice ; frigid she might be , but he thought she had a good idea there ; because there were many varieties of men , her notice would eventually bear fruit . He stared at the universe which the Gansas , in a Buzzardian way , was currently surrounding . Against a uterine blackness stood a number of close and fuzzy bars of light . It was like a drunken fly 's close - up view of a comb , lacking definition and forming an affront to the optic nerve . But , as the scientists pointed out , the human optic nerve was not adjusted to reality . Because the true nature of the universe could only be glimpsed through the transponential equations , it followed that this fuzzy grill ( which made one feel , come to think of it , like a minor crustacean with the baleen of a blue whale grinning down at one ) was what the stars "
45292	45350	45039	45039	I	0	” looked like . Plato , reflected Lattimore , thou shouldst be living at this hour ! He turned away and contrived to turn his thoughts similarly away toward the thought of food . 104 Say what you liked , there was nothing like a good synthetic stew for calling armistice between a man and his universe . “
45355	45361	45353	45353	Mihaly	208	” Enid Ainson was saying , “
45415	45422	45406	45406	you	208	" She pressed her hands together . “
45446	45484	45430	45430	He	208	" Perhaps I have a naturally chivalrous attitude to ladies , Enid , but you have read too much into it . What can I do but thank you deeply for your flattering suggestion , but really .... "
45518	45579	45513	45513	she	1319	“ You need say no more . I will tell you only that the thought of you and your imagined fondness - how often I foolishly imagined that it was only your friendship with Bruce that kept you from making advances towards me!- your hollow fondness has been the only factor keeping me sane over these last few impossible years . "
45580	45588	45513	45513	she	1319	“ Come , I am certain you exaggerate "
45589	45669	45675	45675	her	1320	“ I am talking ! I see now that all your airs and graces , all this phony Hungarian glamour you put on , they all mean nothing . You are just a false front , Mihaly , a romantic who dislikes romances , a - a lady 's man who is afraid of ladies . Good - bye to you , Mihaly , and damn you ! Through you I have lost both my husband and my son . ”
45781	45788	45789	45789	He	208	“ Darling , has she gone ? "
45915	45953	45901	45901	Lattimore	237	“ Steady now , Hilary ! I hate to see a pretty cosmeclectician in a tizzy . So you wanted a volunteer , so you 've got him ; now go ahead and give him the pitch . ”
46009	46029	46003	46003	she	2335	" This volunteer is rather special , Mr. Lattimore . Does the name Samuel Melmoth mean anything to you ? ”
46030	46057	45999	45999	her	2335	" Not a thing . No , wait ! Ye gods and little fishes ! It 's Ainson 's son ! You mean he 's volunteered ? ”
46058	46092	45999	45999	her	2335	" He has managed to make himself rather unpopular down in the mess quarters , and in consequence feels rather antisocial . A friend of his called Quilter gave him a black eye . ”
46093	46113	46003	46003	she	2335	“ Quilter again , eh ? Likely leader material there ; I must speak to the Captain about him . ”
46114	46139	46003	46003	she	2335	" I 'd like you to come and stand by me while I brief this young Ainson , if you are n't too busy . "
46140	46152	45999	45999	her	2335	" Hilary , I 'd stand by you at any time . ”
46421	46455	46417	46417	Lattimore	221	“ This is the Flight Adviser , Mr. Lattimore . He knows as well as anyone the communication problems you will be up against , and can give you pointers on the subject . "
46456	46464	46465	46466	young Ainson	146	“ How do you do , sir , ”
46485	46643	46465	46466	young Ainson	146	“ just to put you in the picture , as they say . When we come out of TP flight , we shall be in a star cluster that contains at least fifteen planets , of which six , to judge by a remote technivisual survey conducted by the Mariestopes , have Earth - type atmospheres . Our aliens , as you know , were found beside a space vehicle - whether it belonged to them or to an allied species , we hope to determine soon . But it suggests that we may find space flight established in this cluster . In that case we shall need to survey all inhabited planets . It was planned before we left Earth that on the first such planet we should deposit an unmanned observation post . Since then , however , I have had a further idea , which Captain Pestalozzi had agreed to let me carry out . "
46708	46826	46700	46700	you	1354	” Safe in the blown - up popinjay heart , they all smiled at each other . But does he detect , Lattimore asked himself , the lie in Mrs. Warhoon 's words ? Who knows yet what hells these rhinomen may create on their home ground , who knows if there is n't some man - devouring form of farmer who uses the rhinomen as greedily as we use the Improved Danish 107 Landrace pig ? And of course the old Lattimoronic question , Who knows what hells this latter - day Saint Anthony will create for himself in his alien wilderness ? That ill wind can not be sheltered from , but the others can . “
46837	46866	46832	46832	you	1354	” he said , aware by Mrs. Warhoon 's glance that she saw it as a minor betrayal . Compressing her lips , she turned back to Ainson . "
46887	46888	46876	46876	We	1351	" “
46904	47015	46901	46901	you	1354	" We shall train you , Mr. Melmoth . There are nine whole ship 's days before we break out of TP , and much can be learnt in that time . On Earth , it may have been that an impossible task was attempted ; on the aliens ' home planet , when we can see them in their own context , the task will be much lighter . Indeed , the aliens should be very much more communicative in their own environment . We think that probably the wonders of Earth , the size of our starships , and so on , may have partly paralyzed their responses . “
47091	47195	47197	47197	I	0	" Now I get to my next point . The learning time of any species is in its early days , its baby days , and wherever we go in the galaxy we can expect to find the same rule applying . Children on Earth who through some misadventure learn no language are at twelve or thirteen too old to learn one . This has been proved many times with babies , for instance , in India , who have been tended by monkeys or wolves . Once the time of childhood is past , they are past acquiring the gift of speech . "
47244	47342	47347	47347	Aylmer	146	“ It may be — we do n't deny it — that it will prove impossible to communicate with these creatures . But the proof must be conclusive . After we have left you , we shall go to investigate the other planets in the cluster ; no doubt we shall capture a group of the aliens and take them back to Earth , or even establish a base on one of the other 108 planets , but that will have to wait on local conditions . Meanwhile , you will be my number - one project . ”
47426	47438	47457	47458	Mrs. Warhoon	225	" How long will you be leaving me on this planet ? ”
47439	47456	47457	47458	Mrs. Warhoon	225	“ Well , it will be for no longer than a year , that I promise , "
47487	47496	47471	47471	They	1368	“ How does all that sound to you ? ”
47624	47636	47637	47638	Aylmer Ainson	146	" I feel very honored to be given such an assignment , ”
48191	48194	48195	48195	he	221	“ Hover , ”
48198	48203	48195	48195	he	221	“ Alien life ahead . ”
48241	48246	48247	48247	Lattimore	221	“ Set her down , ”
48264	48275	48276	48276	Lattimore	221	“ Better have your rifles in case there 's trouble , ”
48542	48552	48533	48533	He	221	" I did n't realize they were so big , ”
48557	48579	48533	48533	He	221	“ Are they going to charge us ? We ca n't run - hadn't we better get back to the snooper ? ”
48580	48588	48589	48589	Quilter	169	" They 're all ready to run , ”
48637	48643	48644	48644	he	169	“ Keep walking , Honeybunch , ”
48665	48675	48659	48659	He	275	" Hey , they 're attacking from the rear ! ”
48785	48790	48791	48791	Lattimore	221	" Hold your fire ! ”
48990	49015	49016	49016	Lattimore	221	" If we went up in the snooper and flew low , we might throw a scare into them and get a moving target , ”
49048	49059	49060	49060	he	169	“ Somebody ought to teach those slugs how to run , "
49197	49200	49201	49201	he	290	" Degenerate , "
49205	49215	49201	49201	he	290	“ A race in decline , that 's obvious . ”
49216	49237	49238	49239	Mrs. Warhoon	225	" I do n't think anything is obvious . We are too far from Earth for anything to be obvious , ”
49243	49254	49238	49239	Mrs. Warhoon	225	" You 've only got to look at the things , ”
50446	50458	50459	50460	Mrs. Warhoon	225	" I just hope he 's going to be all right , ”
50463	50482	50459	50460	Mrs. Warhoon	225	" Stop worrying . He 's got enough ammunition here to shoot every living thing on the planet , ”
50843	50853	50855	50856	the Chaplain	1518	“ May you find peace here , my son , "
50872	50889	50855	50856	the Chaplain	1518	“ Remember that in your year of isolation you will be always in God 's presence . "
50890	50899	50901	50902	the Adjutant	1519	" Good luck in your work , Melmoth , ”
50904	50916	50901	50902	the Adjutant	1519	“ We 'll be seeing you in a year 's time . ”
50917	50934	50935	50935	Quilter	169	“ Adios , Sam , and I 'm sorry about that black eye I gave you , ”
50944	50955	50957	50958	Mrs. Warhoon	225	" Are you sure there 's nothing else you need ? ”
51978	52000	52001	52001	she	225	“ Whatever it was I thought I saw when I ran into that statue must have been a kind of brainstorm , ”
52011	52048	52001	52001	she	225	“ You know , I was all overwrought that day . I really felt - oh , I had the queerest feeling that man had taken a wrong turning somewhere along the evolutionary line or something . "
52049	52056	52057	52057	Lattimore	237	“ Never disregard your first impressions , "
52073	52135	52061	52061	He	237	" Once we get these aliens back to Earth and teach them English , I wo n't feel so bad . I take my profession too seriously ; it 's a sign of immaturity , I suppose . But we shall have so much knowledge to exchange . ... Oh , Bryant ... I talk too much , do n't I ? ”
52136	52143	52179	52179	He	237	" I love to hear you . "
52144	52154	52156	52156	she	225	" It 's so cozy here on this rug . ”
52182	52222	52179	52179	He	237	“ We hit vacuum tomorrow for Earth . I do n't wish to lose sight of you when we get back , Hilary . Do you mind telling me just how emotionally involved you are with Sir Mihaly Pasztor ? ”
52280	52294	52296	52296	he	237	" She 's all cleaned and ready for the next spot of action , "
52314	52337	52296	52296	he	237	“ Talking of action , there 's going to be trouble down on the men 's decks unless something 's done soon . ”
52338	52344	52345	52345	Lattimore	237	" What sort of trouble ? ”
52359	52370	52371	52371	Quilter	169	" Same sort of trouble we had on the Mariestopes , "
52374	52456	52371	52371	Quilter	169	“ All these rhinomen we got aboard , they make quite a lot of droppings . The men are refusing to clear it away without dirty pay . Guess what really annoyed them is that the food synthesizer on Deck H broke down this morning and they were given real old - fashioned meat - ofanimal instead . The slobs of cooks thought nobody would notice , but several of the guys are in sick bay right now with cholesterol poisoning . "
52457	52466	52467	52467	Lattimore	237	“ What a way to run a ship ! ”
52520	52530	52531	52531	she	225	" Meat - of - animal is not poisonous , "
52534	52547	52531	52531	she	225	" In the backward parts of Earth it is still eaten regularly . ”
52573	52586	52587	52587	Quilter	169	" Yeah , only we happen to be civilized , not backward , "
52598	52616	52587	52587	Quilter	169	“ That 's why the guys are going on strike against having to swab up these droppings . ”
52672	52682	52683	52683	she	225	" You 're all the same , you men ! ”
52686	52871	52872	52872	She	1579	“ You 're all cut off from the basic realities of life in a way a woman could never be . For good or ill , we 're a species of flesh - eaters , and always have been . Meat - of - animal is not poisonous — if you 're sick after eating it , it 's your mind that has poisoned you . And all this fear of excreta - can't you see that to these poor unfortunate beings we have captured , their waste products are a sign of fertility , that they ceremonially offer their rejected mineral salts back to their earth when they have done with them ? My god , what 's so repulsive about that ? Is it any more repulsive than the terrestrial religions where living human sacrifices are offered up to 121 various supposed deities ? The trouble with our culture is that it is based on a fear of dirt , of poison , of excreta . You think excreta 's bad , but it 's the fear of it that 's bad ! ”
52896	52963	52889	52889	Lattimore	237	“ What 's got into you , Hilary ? Nobody 's afraid of the stuff . We 're just bored with it . Like you say , it 's a waste product . OK , SO waste it ; do n't go down on your knees to it . No wonder these goddamn rhinomen have gotten nowhere if they 've oriented their lives around the stuff . ”
52964	52967	52973	52973	he	169	“ Besides , ”
52983	53005	52973	52973	he	169	“ our guys do n't actually object to shoveling the stuff . They just object to shoveling it without dirty pay . ”
53006	53018	53019	53020	Mrs. Warhoon	225	“ But you are both of you missing my point entirely , "
53035	53042	53026	53026	her	225	“ That 'll do , Hilary , "
53047	53058	53043	53043	Lattimore	237	" Come off this coprophilous kick and pull yourself together . "
53125	53140	53111	53111	He	298	“ You must bring yourself to full wakefulness , my dear to the door . ”
53141	53168	53181	53182	the utod	2288	“ My old bones are stiff , Snok Snok . I quite enjoy their stiffness , as long as I 'm left horizontal to do so . "
53169	53180	53181	53182	the utod	2288	" You prepare yourself for the carrion stage of life . ”
53215	53243	53206	53206	he	2288	“ When you change to carrion , Mother and I will plant you under the ammps , and in your next cycle you shall become a utod . ”
53244	53274	53185	53185	He	2288	" Thank you very much , but I 'm certain that that was n't what you woke me for . What 's the matter ? What 's worrying you ? "
53299	53322	53294	53294	He	2288	“ Some Manlegs are coming here . I saw them bumping on a round - legged four - legs toward our dunghill . ”
53331	53345	53323	53323	Ainson	299	“ Men ? I do n't believe it , after all these years . "
53774	53784	53785	53786	the soldier	1603	“ You are Samuel Melmoth , of the Gansas ? ”
53831	53834	53835	53836	the soldier	1603	“ Melmoth ? ”
53863	53879	53835	53836	the soldier	1603	" Come , come , you are Melmoth of the Gansas , are n't you ? ”
53887	53894	53895	53896	Snok Snok	299	“ He has made a mistake , ”
53904	53933	53895	53896	Snok Snok	299	" Ca n't you keep your specimens in their wallows ? You are Melmoth ; I begin to recognize you now . Why do n't you answer me ? "
53952	53957	53958	53958	he	299	" Looks like rain , ”
53961	53995	53958	53958	he	299	" You do talk ! I 'm afraid that you 've had rather a wait for your relief . How are you , Melmoth ? You do n't remember me , do you ? ”
54019	54035	54007	54007	He	299	" I 'm afraid - It 's been so long , I 've been alone . "
54036	54071	54007	54007	He	299	" Forty - one years , by my reckoning . My name 's Quilter , Hank Quilter , Captain of the starraider Hightail . . . . Quilter . You do n't remember me ? "
54072	54078	54079	54079	I	0	" It 's been so long- "
54154	54183	54253	54253	they	1615	” Ainson wanted to be genial to this fellow who seemed to bear him goodwill , but somehow he could n't get the line of talk sorted out . "
54203	54249	54253	54253	they	1615	" Then he thought of something he wanted to say , something that must have worried him for- oh , maybe for ten years , but that was a long way back . He leaned against the doorpost , cleared his throat , and asked , “
54264	54265	54266	54267	Captain Quilter	301	” "
54321	54322	54317	54317	I	0	” “
54333	54366	54328	54328	you	169	” Captain Quilter looked over the old cripple 's shoulders , sniffed , and shook his head . Plainly the old boy had gone native and had the hogs in with him . "
54391	54392	54378	54378	I	0	" “
54406	54407	54398	54399	Snok Snok	299	” “
54442	54459	54436	54436	me	0	” Angrily , Ainson brushed the offered arm away . He hobbled forward on his crutches . “
54468	54480	54465	54466	Snok Snok	299	" he said in the language they had contrived between them . "
54493	54564	54481	54481	I	0	” With pleasure , he noted that he was puffing far less than the Captain . At the truck they both rested , while the two men looked on with furtive interest . Almost apologetically the Captain offered a bottle ; when Ainson refused it , the other drank deep . Ainson spent the interval trying to think of something friendly to say . All he could think of was , “
54573	54574	54571	54571	Captain	569	" "
54616	54791	54608	54608	I	0	" Remember the old - type Contained Conflicts they used to have on Charon ? Well , there was an Anglo - Brazilian conflict that got out of hand . The Britishers started contravening the laws of warfare as they then were ; it was proved that they had smuggled in a Master Explorer , which was a social rank not allowed in the conflicts — in case they took advantage of their expert knowledge to exploit the local terrain , you know — I studied the whole incident in Mil . Hist . school , but you forget the finer details . Anyhow , this explorer fellow Ainson was brought back from Charon to Earth for trial , and he was shot , and the Brazilians said he committed suicide , and the Britishers said the Brazilians shot him , and , well , the States got involved — turned out an American revolver was found outside the prison , and in no time a war blew up , just like old times . "
54827	54836	54837	54837	he	303	" Did you think I 'd been shot ? ”
54848	54928	54840	54840	Quilter	301	" We did n't know what had happened to you . The International War broke out on Earth in 2037 , and we sort of forgot about you . Though there has been a lot of fighting in this sector of space , particularly on Numbers and Genesis . They 're practically destroyed . Clementina caught a packet too . You were lucky there were only conventional forces here . Did n't you see anything of the fighting here ? ”
54929	54934	54840	54840	Quilter	301	" Fighting on Dapdrof ? ”
54935	54940	54840	54840	Quilter	301	“ Fighting on Pestalozzi . ”
54941	54953	54840	54840	Quilter	301	“ No fighting here , I do n't know about there . "
54954	54983	54840	54840	Quilter	301	“ You must have escaped it in this hemisphere . The north hemisphere is practically fried , judging by what I saw of it on the way in . ”
54984	54991	54840	54840	Quilter	301	“ You never came for me . "
54992	55104	54840	54840	Quilter	301	“ Hell , I 'm explaining , are n't I ? Have a drink ; it 'll steady you . Only a very few people knew of you , and I guess most of them are dead now . I stuck my neck out to get to you . Now I 've got a ship of my own under my command , I 'd be glad to take you home - well , there 's only a fragment of Great Britain left , but you 'd be welcome in the States . It 'd sort of square up that old black eye , hey ? What do you say , Melmoth ? ”
55150	55170	55146	55146	his	1882	" That reminds me , Captain . I 've got all the tapes and recordings and vocabularies and stuff . ”
55171	55177	55218	55218	Quilter	301	“ What stuff 's that ? ”
55178	55217	55218	55218	Quilter	301	“ Why , now you 're forgetting . The stuff I was landed here to get . I have worked out a good bit of the utodian language -the language of these ... these aliens , you know . ”
55231	55242	55223	55223	He	301	" Perhaps we could pick that up some other time . "
55243	55275	55218	55218	Quilter	301	" What , in another forty years ? Oh , no , I 'm not going back to Earth without that gear , Captain . Why , it 's my lifework . ”
55276	55279	55281	55281	Quilter	301	“ Right , ”
55369	55381	55382	55382	he	301	“ We 'll take whatever you want to take , Melmoth , "
55402	55426	55386	55386	He	301	" Bonn , Wilkinson , run the truck up to the door of the shack and get Mr. Melmoth 's gear loaded aboard . ”
55450	55496	55445	55445	Quilter	301	" You 'll be OK . There must be a pile of credits waiting somewhere in a bank for you ; I 'll see you get every cent that 's due to you . You 'll be glad to get out of this crushing gravity . ”
55553	55563	55564	55564	Ainson	299	" It 's the unaccustomed drink , Captain Printer , ”
55570	55580	55564	55564	Ainson	299	" Did you tell me England had been destroyed ? ”
55581	55661	55564	55564	Ainson	299	“ Now , do n't start worrying about that , Melmoth . It really is wonderful to be alive on Earth now , and I swear that 's true . The life is a bit regimented as yet , but all national differences have been composed , at least for the time being . Everyone is reconstructing like mad - of course , the war gave a terrific boost to technology . I wish I was twenty years younger . ”
55662	55668	55564	55564	Ainson	299	“ But you said England ... "
55669	55701	55702	55702	Affectionately	307	" They are damming half the North Sea to replace the disintegrated areas with topsoil , and London is going to be rebuilt - on a modest scale , of course . ”
55738	55769	55730	55730	his	1634	" Trouble is , after all these years I 'm out of touch . Why , I do n't think I 'll ever be in contact with anyone properly anymore . ”
55805	55835	55797	55798	the grokkies	308	" Why , now , that 's a pack of nonsense . You and I have soon got things straight between each other , have n't we , Melmoth ? ”
55836	55849	55862	55862	Limbs	310	“ Yes , yes , that certainly is so , Captain Quinto . ”
