The water was black and he bobbed up in it swiftly , obscurely aware that it was dangerous to do so , but he was helpless to stop ; he tumbled over and swam downward , arms loose and thrusting like tentacles , but it was useless . Air popped out of him in a stream of white bubbles that flattened and shimmied as they squashed upward , all clustered around bearing him to the surface . He glanced up , suddenly aware of the idea of surface ; and there it was , an undulating sheet of obsidian silk on which chips of raw silver skittered wildly back and forth . A flock of startled birds turning all at once - no - it was , he thought as the world began to roar , the shattered image of a crescent moon . At the thought a whole cosmology bloomed in himAnd broke apart like the moon 's image , as he crashed up into the air and gasped . He flailed at the water whooping and kicking hard to stay afloat ; he felt a wave lift him , and flopped around to face it . A cold smack in the face and he tumbled again , thrashed through a somersault and came up breathing , barking like a seal to suck in more air . KIM STANLEY ROBINSON The next time under he rammed a sandbar and then he was rolling on a steep shorebreak , sluiced by sandy water and struck repeatedly by small silver fish . He crawled up through rushing foam , mouth full of salty grit , hands sinking wrist - deep in the wet sand . The little fish leaped in the phosphorescent foam , banged into his arms and legs . The beach was bouncing with silver fish , it was like an infestation of insects . On hands and knees he could n't avoid squashing some into the sand . At the high water mark he collapsed . He looked across a gleaming black strand , filigreed with sea foam receding on a wave . Coarse - grained sand sparked with reflected moonlight , and the fish arched to the shape of the crescent moon , which hung over the horizon at the end of a mirrorflake path of water . Such a dense , intricate , shifting texture of black and whiteA large wave caught him , rolled him back down among the suffocating fish . He clawed the sand without effect , then slammed into another body , warm and as naked as he was . The receding wave rushed down to the triple ripple of the low water mark , leaving them behind : he and a woman , a woman with close - cropped hair . She appeared senseless and he tried to pull her up , but the next wave knocked them down and rolled them like driftwood . He untangled himself from her and got to his knees , took her arms and pulled her up the wet sand , shifting one knee at a time , the little silver fish bouncing all around them . When he had gotten her a few body lengths into dry sand he fell beside her . He could n't move . From down the beach came shrill birdy cries . Children ran up to them shouting , buckets swinging at the ends of their arms like great deformed hands . When they ran on he could not move his head to track them . They returned to his field of vision , with taller people whose heads scraped the moon . The children dashed up and down the strand on the lace edge of the waves . They dumped full buckets of wriggling silver leaves in a pile beyond his head . Fire bloomed and driftwood was thrown on it , until transparent gold ribbons A SHORT , SHARP SHOCK leaped up into the night . Then another wave caught them and rolled them back down to the sea ; the tide was rising and they would have perished , but the cords of a thrown net stopped them short , and they were hauled back and dumped closer to the fire , which hissed and sizzled . The children were laughing . Later , fighting unconsciousness , he lifted the great stone at the end of his neck . The fire had died , the moon sat on the beach . He looked at the woman beside him . She lay on her stomach , one knee to the side . Dry sand stuck to her skin and the moonlight reflecting from her was gritty ; it sparkled as she breathed . Powerful thighs met in a rounded muscly bottom , which curved the light into the dip of her lower back . Her upper back was broad , her spine in a deep trough of muscle , her shoulders rangy , her biceps thick . Short - cropped hair , dark under the moon 's glaze , curled tight to her head ; and the profile glimpsed over one shoulder was straight - nosed and somehow classical : a swimmer , he thought as his head fell back , with the big chest and smooth hard muscling of a sponge diver , or a sea goddess , something from the myths of a world he could n't remember . Then her arm shifted out , and her hand came to rest against his flank , and the feel of her coursed all through him : a short , sharp , shock . He caught his breath and found he was sitting up facing her , her palm both cool and warm against his side . He watched her catch the moon on her skin and fling it away . KIM STANLEY ROBINSON C Η Α Ρ Τ Ε R T W Ο Sea Wrack hen he woke in the morning , the woman was gone . The sun burned just over the water . He lay on a crumbling sand cliff , the high mark of the previous tide 's assault on the beach . With his head resting on one ear , he saw a wet slick foam - flecked strand of silvery brown , and the sea ; resting on the other , he saw a lumpy expanse of blond beach , dotted with driftwood . Behind the beach was a forest , which rose steeply to a very tall cliff of white stone ; its top edge made a brilliant border with the deep blue sky above . He lifted his head and noticed that the sand cliff under him was a tiny model of the granite cliff standing over the forest - a transient replica , already falling into the sea . But then again the immense rock cliff was also falling into the sea , the forest its beach , the beach its strand . It repeated the little sand cliff 's dissolution on a scale of time so much vaster that the idea of it made him dizzy . The tide ebbs and the stars die . On the wet strand a troop of birds ran back and forth . They seemed a kind of sandpiper , except their feathers were a dark metallic red . They stabbed away at dead grunion KIM STANLEY ROBINSON rolling in the wrack , and then dashed madly up the strand chased by waves , their stick legs pumping over blurred reflections of themselves . They made one of these frantic cavalry charges right under a thick white fishing line ; surprised at the sight , he raised himself up on his elbows and looked behind him . A surf fisher sat on a big driftwood log . In fact there were several of them , scattered down the beach at more or less regular intervals . The one closest to him was all in brown , an old brown woman in a baggy coat and floppy hat , who waved briefly at him and did not stir from her log . He stood and walked to her . Beside her a bucket stood on the sand , filled with the little silver fish from the previous night . She gestured at the bucket , offering him some of the fish , and he saw that her hand was a thick mass of shiny dark brown , her fingers long tubes of lighter hollow brown , with bulbs at their ends . Like tubes of seaweed . And her coat was a brown frond of kelp , and her face a wrinkled brown bulb , popped by the slit of her mouth ; and her eyes were polyps , smooth and wet . An animated bundle of seaweed . He knew this was wrong , but there she sat , and the sun was bright and it was hard to think . Many things inside his head had broken or gone away . He felt no particular emotion . He sat on the sand beside her fishing pole , trying to think . There was a thick tendril that fell from her lower back to her driftwood log , attaching her to it . He found he was puzzled . "

1816	1890	1893	1894	the woman	966	" She had a wet hissing voice , a strange accent . But it was his language , or a language he knew . He could n't decide if he knew any others or not . She gestured again at her bucket , repeating her offer . Noticing suddenly the pangs of his hunger , he took a few grunion from the bucket and swallowed them . When he had finished he said , “

He noticed that each of the seated surf fishers had a child running about in its area . Buckets sat on the sand like discarded party hats . For a long time he sat and watched the child approach . It was hard to think . The sunlight hurt his eyes . "

2235	2252	2232	2232	you	61	" he said at last . She pointed down the beach , away from the sun . "
2275	2353	2354	2354	You	65	" He looked at the cliff . It would be a hard climb . He KIM STANLEY ROBINSON took a few more grunion from the bucket . Fellow fish , dead of self - discovery . The seaweed woman grubbed in a dark mass of stuff in the lee of her log , then offered him a skirt of woven seaweed . He tied it around his waist , thanked her and took off across the beach . "
2359	2365	2354	2354	You	65	" she called after him . “
2381	3774	2375	2377	the spine kings	56	" 10 A SHORT , SHARP SHOCK C Η Α Ρ Τ Ε R Ι Η R Ε Ε The Spine he forest was thick and damp , with leaves scattered at every level , from the rotting logs embedded in the carpet of ferns to the sunbroken ceiling of leaves overhead . Streams gurgled down the slope , but apparently it had not rained for some time , as smaller creekbeds held only trickles ; one served him as a pebble - bottomed trail , broken by networks of exposed roots . In the cool gloom he hiked uphill , moving from glade to glade as if from one green room to the next , each sculpted according to a different theory of space and color . Leaves everywhere gave proof of his eye 's infinite depth of field , and all was still except for the water falling to the sea — and an occasional flash in his peripheral vision , birds , perhaps , which he could never quite see . The forest ended at the bottom of the cliff , which rose overhead like the side of an enormous continent . Boulders taller than the trees were scattered about at the foot of the cliff . Ferns and mosses covered the tumble of rotten granite between boulders . The cliff itself was riven by deep gullies , which were almost as steep as the buttresses separating them . He clambered between boulders looking for a KIM STANLEY ROBINSON likely way up , in a constant fine mist : far above waterfalls had broken apart , and to the left against the white rock was a broad faint rainbow . Just as he was concluding that he would have to scramble up one of the gulleys he came on a trail going up the side of one , beginning abruptly in the ferny talus . The trail was wide enough for two people to walk side by side , and had been hacked out of the granite side wall of the gully , where it switch - backed frequently . When the side wall became completely vertical , the trail wound out over the buttress to the left and zigzagged up that steep finger of stone , in stubborn defiance of the breathtaking exposure . It was impossible to imagine how the trail had been built , and it was also true that a break anywhere in the supporting walls would have cut the trail as neatly as miles of empty air ; but there were no breaks , and the weedless gravel and polished bedrock he walked over indicated frequent use . He climbed as if on a staircase in a dream , endlessly ascending in hairpin turns , until the forest and beach below became no more than green and blond stripes running as far as he could see in both directions , between the sunbeaten blue of the ocean and the sunbeaten white of the granite . Then the cliff laid back , and the trail led straight ahead on an incline that got less and less steep , until he saw ahead a skyline of shattered granite , running right to left as far as he could see . The rock stood stark against the sky . He hurried forward and suddenly he was on the crest of a ridge extending to his left and right , and before him he saw ocean again - ocean far below , spread out in front of him exactly as it was behind . Surprised , he walked automatically to a point where he could see all the way down : a steep cliff , a strip of forest , a strip of sand , the white - on - blue tapestry of breaking waves , the intense cobalt of the sea . He stepped back and staggered a little , trying to look in every direction at once . He was standing on the crest of a tall peninsula , which snaked through an empty ocean for as far as he could see . It was a narrow ridge of white granite , running roughly east to west , bisecting the blue plate of the sea and twice 1 2 A SHORT , SHARP SHOCK marring the circular line of the horizon . The ridge rose to peaks again and again , higher perhaps in the talcum of afternoon light to the west ; it also undulated back and forth , big S shapes making a frozen sine wave . The horizon was an enormous distance away , so far away that it seemed wrong to him , as wrong as the seaweed woman . In fact the whole prospect was fantastically strange ; but there he stood , feeling the wind rake hard over the lichen - stained ridge , watching it shove at low shrubs and tufts of sedge . It occurred to him that the peninsula extended all the way around the world . A big ocean world , and this lofty ring of rock its only land : he was sure of it . It was as if it were something he remembered . KIM STANLEY ROBINSON 3 1 Ο Η Α Ρ Τ Ε R Ε ο υ R Beauty Is the Promise of Happiness nd the only happiness is action . So he roused himself and headed west , thinking that a bend in the peninsula out that way might hide Kataptron Cove . The sun fell just to the right of the rock , slowing as it fell , flattening as if reluctant to touch the horizon , breaking into bands of glowing orange light that stretched until they were sucked down by the sea . The twilight was long , a mauve and purple half day , and he hiked rapidly over the crest 's shattered granite , which was studded with crystals of translucent quartz . As he walked over the rough edges of stones , feeling liberty in the twisting ligaments of his ankles , he kept an eye out for some sort of shelter for the night . The trail he had followed onto the spine had disappeared , no doubt because the crest itself served as a broad high trail ; but at one point a deep transverse cleft had been filled at a single spot by boulders , confirming his notion that the trail still ran , and would reappear when needed . So he was not surprised when he came upon a low circular stone hut , next to a small pool of water . In this area stone broke away from the bedrock in irregular plates , and a KIM STANLEY ROBINSON 1.5 great number of these had been gathered and stacked in rings that grew successively smaller as they got higher off the ground , until a final large capstone topped things off . The stones had been sized and placed so precisely that it would have been difficult to get more than a fingernail between any two of them . A short chimney made of smaller stones protruded from one side of the roof . Opening a wooden door in the wall opposite the chimney , he entered and found a wooden shelf circling the interior of the wall . Next to the fireplace was a stack of kindling and logs ; other than that the hut was empty . He was without the means to start a fire , and it was fairly warm in any case , so he went back outside and drank from the pool , then sat against the west wall to eat the last of the fisherwoman 's grunion , in the final hour of twilight . As the light leaked out of the sky it turned a deep rich blue , dark but not quite black : and across this strangely palpable firmament the stars popped into existence , thousands upon thousands of them , from bright disks that might have been nearby planets to dots so faint that he could only see them by looking slightly to the side . Eventually the sky was packed with stars , so densely that they defined perfectly the dome of sky ; and frightened him . “
3786	3887	3889	3889	you	67	" he said shakily to the hut , and then felt acutely his solitude , and the emptinesses inside his mind , the black membranes he could not penetrate . He retreated into the hut . After a long time lying on the hard wooden shelf , he fell asleep . Sometime before dawn he was awakened by a crowd of folk banging in the doorway . They held him down and searched under his skirt . They had broad hard hands . Cloaks made of small leaves sewn together clicked in the dark , and it smelled like oranges . "
3894	3912	3889	3889	you	67	" he asked , drunk with sleep . They laughed , an airy sound . One said , “
3927	3928	3921	3921	your	69	" "
3935	3946	3921	3921	your	69	" A SHORT , SHARP SHOCK The first voice said , "
3956	4346	3950	3952	The spine kings	56	" They all had lumps on their left shoulders , irregular dark masses that looked like shrubs . They took him out of the hut , and under the sea - colored sky he saw that the lumps were in fact shrubs — miniature fruit trees , it appeared , growing out of their left shoulders . The fruits were fragrant and still reminded him of oranges , although the smell had been altered by the salt tang , made more bitter . Round fruit , in any case , of a washed - out color that in better light might have been pale green . The members of this group arranged themselves in a circle facing inward , took off their leaf cloaks and sat down . He sat in the circle between two of them , glancing at the shoulder tree to his right . It definitely grew directly out of the creature 's skin — the gnarled little roots dove into the flesh just as a wart would , leaving an overgrown fissure between bark and skin . With a jerk he looked away . It was almost dawn , and the treefolk began singing a low monophonic chant , in a language he did n't recognize . The sky lightened to its day blue , slightly thickened by the sun 's absence , and the wind suddenly picked up , as if a door had banged open somewhere — a cool fresh breeze , peeling over the spine in the same moment that the sun pricked the distant gray line of the horizon , a green point stretching to a line of hot yellow and then a band of white fire , throwing the sea 's surface into shadow and revealing a scree of low diaphanous cloud . Before the sun had detached itself from the sea each member of the circle had plucked a fruit from the shoulder of the person on their right , and when the sun was clear and the horizon sinking rapidly away from it , they ate . Their bites caused a faint crystalline ringing , and the odor of bitter oranges was strong . He felt his stomach muscles contract , and saliva ran down his throat . The celebrant nearest the sun glanced at him and said , “
4353	4363	3950	3952	The spine kings	56	" He almost nodded , but held himself still . "

5613	5648	5608	5608	Garth	35	" A young man stood . He had been sitting opposite Julo , facing out from the circle , and now Thel noticed his tree grew from the right shoulder rather than the left . "
5665	5684	5660	5660	Thel	33	" Garth hesitated , and Julo strode across the circle of watchers and cuffed him on the arm . “
5688	5705	5660	5660	Thel	33	" Garth approached Thel and stood before him , looked down . Thel said to him , "
5711	5855	5660	5660	Thel	33	" With a grateful glance up the youth indicated the largest fruit , on a lower branch . Thel took the round green sphere in his fingers and pulled sharply , noting Garth 's involuntary wince . Then he sniffed the stem , and bit through the skin . The bitter taste of orange , he sat in a small dark room , watching the wick of a lamp lit by a match held in long fingers , the flame turned up and burning poorly , in a library with bookcases for walls and a huge old leather globe in one corner .... He shook his head , back on the windy dawn spine , Julo 's laughter in his ear , behind that a crystalline ringing . A bird hovered in the updraft , a windhover searching the lee cliff for prey . "
5859	5902	5857	5857	you	0	" Thel said to Garth . The treefolk gathered around him , touched his bare shoulders , asked him questions . He had nothing but questions in reply . Who were the spine kings ? he asked , and their faces darkened . “

6072	6345	6062	6062	They	78	" The boy 's fruit was suddenly heavy on his stomach , and he shuddered as if every cell in him had tasted something bitter . 2 A SHORT , SHARP SHOCK O C Η Α Ρ Τ Ε R Ε Ι ν Ε The Snake and the Tree he treefolk hiked long and hard , following a line on the broad crest that minimized the ups and downs , nearly running along a rock road that Thel judged to be some three thousand feet above the sea . After a few days , the south side of the sinuous peninsula became a fairly gentle slope , cut by ravines and covered with tall redwood trees ; in places on this side the beach was a wide expanse , dotted with ponds and green with rippling dune grass . The north side , on the other hand , remained a nearly vertical cliff , falling directly into waves , which slapped against the rock unbroken and sent bowed counterwaves back out to the north , stippling the blue surface of the water with intersecting arcs . Once their ridge road narrowed , and big blocky towers of pink granite stood in their way . The trail reappeared then , on the sunny southern slope , and they followed it along a contoured traverse below the boulders , passing small pools that looked hacked into the rock . Half a day of this and they had passed the sharp peaks and were back on the ridge , looking ahead down its back as it snaked through KIM STANLEY ROBINSON 27 the blue ocean . “
6352	6605	6062	6062	They	78	" Thel asked , but they only stared at him . Every morning at sunrise Julo ordered young Garth to provide a shoulder apple for Thel 's consumption , and in the absence of any other food Thel accepted it and ate hungrily . He saw no more hallucinations , but each time experienced a sudden flush of pinkness in his vision , and felt the bitter tang of the taste to his bones . His right shoulder began to ache as he lay down to sleep . He ignored it and hiked on . He noticed that on cloudy days his companions hiked more slowly , and that when they stopped by pools to rest on those days , they took off their boots and stuck their feet between cracks in the rock , looking weary and relaxed . Some days later the peninsula took a broad curve to the north , and for the first time the sun set on the south side of it . They stopped at a hut set on a particularly high knob on the ridge , and Thel looked around at the peninsula , splitting the ocean all the way to the distant horizon . It was a big world , no doubt of it ; and the days and nights were much longer than what he had been used to , he was sure . He grew tired at midday , and often woke for a time in the middle of the long nights . “
6612	6629	6062	6062	They	78	” he said to Garth , waving perplexed at the mountainous mound zigzagging across the sea . “
6644	6719	6062	6062	They	78	" This was said almost in jest , given the other more important mysteries of his existence . But Garth stared at him , eyes feverish . He was lying exhausted , his feet deep in a crack ; seeing this in the evenings Thel always resolved not to eat , and every morning he awoke too ravenous to refuse . Now , as if to pay Garth back with conversation , he added , “
6780	6784	6775	6775	I	0	” Garth said , “
6795	6799	6775	6775	I	0	" Thel laughed . “
6825	6830	6815	6815	You	91	" Garth smiled bitterly . “
6864	6865	6854	6854	you	91	" "
6868	6875	6854	6854	you	91	" Thel said , considering it . “
6884	6891	6881	6881	I	0	” And to Garth 's laugh : "
6905	6936	6938	6938	I	0	" It seemed possible that the questions came from the shattered side of his mind , from some past self he could n't recall but which shaped his thinking anyway . "
6942	7014	6938	6938	I	0	" At sunset the wind tended to die , just as the sunrise quickened it ; now it slackened . Perhaps I have died like the wind , he thought ; perhaps the only thing that survives after death are the questions , or the habit of questioning . The two of them watched the sun sink , just to the left of the bump of the spine on the horizon . “
7026	7030	6938	6938	I	0	" Thel said . “
7061	7062	6938	6938	I	0	" "
7067	7071	6938	6938	I	0	" Garth said . “
7081	7082	7072	7076	The priests of the birdfolk	99	" "
7095	7096	7097	7097	I	0	" “
7103	7143	7097	7097	I	0	" The air darkened and the salt air grew chill . Garth was breathing deeply , about to fall asleep , when he said in a voice not his , a voice pleasant but at the same time chilling : "
7155	7628	7097	7097	I	0	" In the days that followed , this image of a landscape in reverse haunted Thel , though in the end it explained nothing . The stony spine continued to split the water , and it got taller , the south side becoming as steep as the north again . In places they walked on a strip of level granite no wider than a person , and on each side the cliffs plunged some five thousand feet into white foam tapestries that shifted back and forth over deep water , as if something below the KIM STANLEY ROBINSON . 2 3 blue were lightly breathing : it disturbed one 's balance to look down at it , and though the strip was wide enough to walk on comfortably , the sheer airiness of it gave Thel vertigo . Garth walked over it with a pinched expression , and Julo laughed at him , cuffed him hard so that he had to go to his knees to avoid falling over the side ; then Julo forced him to walk backwards , which served the others as amusement . Eventually the north side grew less steep , laying out until the peninsula was wider than ever . In this section a hot white cliff faced south , a cool forested slope faced north . On the north slope were scattered stands of enormous evergreens , the tallest trees three or four hundred feet high . One of these giants stood on a ledge just below the crest , and had grown up above the ridge , where the winds had flattened it so that its branches grew horizontally in all directions , some laying over the ridge , others fanning out into the air over the beach and the sea far below . The treefolk greeted this flat - topped giant as an ancestor , and clambered out over the horizontal branches to the tree 's mighty trunk , over it , and out the other side . They ended up on three or four lightning - blasted gnarly branches , ten feet wide and so solid that jumping up and down would not move them , though the whole tree swayed gently in a fitful west wind . Big shallow circular depressions had been cut into the tops of these branches , and the exposed wood had been polished till it gleamed . They spent the night in these open - roofed rooms , under the star - flooded sky . By starlight Thel looked at the wood by his head and saw the grain of centuries of growth exposed . The peninsula had been here for thousands of years , millions of years — both the plant life and the erosion of the granite showed that . But how had it begun ? “
7638	7645	7647	7647	you	103	" he said to the treefolk , "
7665	7703	7657	7657	you	103	" . Julo was looking down into the grain of the floor beneath him , still and rapt as if he had not heard Thel ; but after a while he said , in a low voice , “
7897	7898	7862	7862	her	107	" "
7901	7908	7862	7862	her	107	" Thel said . And then : “
7912	7957	7862	7862	her	107	" But he did n't see , and he arranged himself for sleep and looked up into the thickets of stars , disappointed . Garth lay next to him , and much later , when the others were asleep , he whispered to him , “
7998	8104	8105	8105	We	109	" KIM STANLEY ROBINSON 25 С Н А Р Т Е R S T x Kataptron Cove he next dawn it was bitterly cold out on the swaying branches , and they sat back against the curved wall of the biggest room shivering as Julo watched the sky to determine the exact moment of sunrise , hidden behind the ridge . When he turned to pluck the fruit from the man next to him he took three , and the others did the same . Thel restricted himself to his usual one of Garth 's , and asked him why the others had eaten more . "
8113	8473	8105	8105	We	109	" And so they did . It was on the south side , in an arc the peninsula made . Here the granite side of the peninsula was marred by the shattered walls of a small crater — a horseshoe ring of jagged black rock , extending into the sea and broken open to it at its outermost point , so that the inside of the crater was a small lagoon . Clearly it was an old volcanic vent , and as it was the first sign of vulcanism that Thel had seen , he approached it with interest . But he was soon distracted by the grim faces of the treefolk , who marched around him as if going into battle . Foreboding charged the air , and the treefolk abandoned the KIM STANLEY ROBINSON 27 trail that descended the southern slope in a long traverse to the crater bay , and struggled through dense woods above the trail . They descended into thick salt air filled with the sound of waves , gliding from tree to tree like spirits , moving very slowly onto the high crumbly rim of the crater , overlooking the inner lagoon . The curving inner wall of the crater was a reddish cliff , overgrown with green . Where the crater met the spine a stream fell down the inner wall and across the sand into the lagoon ; on the banks of the stream there was a permanent camp , built in a grove of trees that had been cleared of undergrowth . In the shadows of these trees people moved , and smoke spiraled up through the sunbeams lancing among the branches . In the depths of the grove there was a hubbub , and a crowd emerged onto the open beach , a gang wearing leather skirts and belted short swords , and tight golden helmets . They chivvied along a short row of prisoners , naked and in chains , and Thel heard Garth whimper softly . He looked around and saw that the treefolk had their eyes fixed on the beach in horror , and unwilling fascination . “
8478	8516	8105	8105	We	109	" he said . Garth pointed at where the grove met the beach . Two tall tree trunks standing beside each other had been stripped bare ; behind the trunks stood a platform about half their height . “
8523	8833	8834	8836	The spine kings	56	” Garth whispered , and would not elaborate . He sat with his back to the scene , head in hands . Thel and the rest of the treefolk watched as a prisoner was hauled up the steps of the platform . Two'crews on the ground set about winding ropes tied to the top of each tree trunk , until the trunks were crossing each other at about the level of the platform . Intuitively Thel understood the function of the large bowed X the trees made , and his stomach contracted to a hard knot of tension and vicarious terror ; still he watched as the first prisoner was tied to the two trees , and the thick ropes holding the trees in position were knocked off notched stumps , and the two tall trunks 28 A SHORT , SHARP SHOCK returned to an upright position , with a stately swaying motion that had not the slightest hitch in it when the prisoner was ripped apart . Blood fountained from the head and the body , now separated . Thel saw that the beach around the two trees was littered with lumps here and there , all a dark brown , now splattered with red : the wreckage of lives . At that distance people were the size of dolls , and they heard nothing of them over the sounds of waves . The executioners tied each prisoner to the two trees in a different manner , so that the second came apart at the limbs , and the third in the middle , leaving a long loop of intestine hanging between the two poles . Thel found he was sitting . His skin was covered with a sour sweat . He felt cold . He moved in front of Garth , took his face in his hands . “
8838	8843	8834	8836	The spine kings	56	" Garth nodded miserably . "
8848	8876	8846	8846	they	56	" No response . Feeling the futility of the question , Thel stood and went to Julo , who laughed maliciously as he saw Thel 's face . "
8882	8886	8879	8879	you	111	" Thel asked . "
8976	8987	8968	8968	We	113	" he said , ironic to the point of snarling . "
8996	9008	9009	9009	I	0	" Thel nodded , impressed despite himself by Julo 's courage . “
9016	9020	9014	9014	you	116	" he said . “
9028	9029	9030	9030	She	117	" “
9037	9042	9030	9030	She	117	" Julo warned him . “
9059	9519	9014	9014	you	116	" KIM STANLEY ROBINSON 29 C Η Α Ρ Τ Ε R S Ε Ο Ε Ν Two Xs o in the long indigo twilight they made their way around the rim of the crater bay like ghosts , stepping so silently that the loudest sound coming from them was their heartbeats , tocking at the backs of their open mouths . Shadows with heartbeats , as silent as the fear of death , slipping from trunk to trunk and searching the forest ahead with the acute gaze of hunted beasts ... the spine king sentinels carried crossbows , Julo had said . They descended the crater wall well away from the village , and then worked their way back to it through a thin forest of pines , stepping across a carpet of brown needles . Ahead came the sound of voices , and the beach stream . The leaves of the treefolk 's shoulder bushes rustled when they moved too quickly . It was getting dark , the color draining out of everything except the pinpricks of fire dancing in the black needles ahead . Drumming began , parodying their heavy heartbeats . They hugged the crater wall , circled to the edge of a firelit clearing . In the clearing were huts , cages , and platforms , all made of straight branches with the bark still on them . Some UCS , KIM STANLEY ROBINSON 31 of the cages held huddled figures . Thel froze . Reflection of torchlight from a pair of eyes , the shaggy head of a wild beast captured and caged , brilliant whites defiant and exhausted : it was her . Thel stared and stared at the black lump of the body , heavy in the dark , clothed only in dirt — the tangled hair backlit by fireeyes reflecting torchlight . He had no idea why he was so certain . But he knew it was the swimmer . The treefolk were clustered around him . When guards with torches arrived in the clearing , the prisoners sat up , and around him Thel heard a faint rustling of leaves . He peered more closely and saw that the cage beside the swimmer 's held seated figures , slumped over . One of them begged for water and the guards approached . In the sharply flickering torchlight Thel could see slack faces , eyes shut against the light , odd hunched shoulders — ah . Trunks , stalks , stumps : their shoulder bushes had been chopped off . One of the captured treefolk , lying flat on the ground , was hauled up ; he still had his little tree , its fruit gone , its leaves drooping . "
9525	9756	9759	9759	you	118	" one guard said drunkenly , and drew his short broad sword and hacked away . It took several blows , thunk , thunk , the victim weeping , his companions listless , looking away , the other guards holding the victim upright and steady and finally bending the trunk of the miniature tree until it broke with a dull crack . The victim flopped to the ground and the guards left the cage and tossed the little tree onto the embers of a big fire : it flared up white and burned well for several minutes , as if the wood were resinous . Thel 's companions had watched this scene without moving ; only the rustle of leaves betrayed their distress . The guards left and they slipped back into the black forest , and Thel followed them . When they showed no signs of stopping he crashed forward recklessly , and pulled at Julo 's arm ; when Julo shrugged him off and continued on , Thel reached out and grabbed the trunk of Julo 's shoulder tree and yanked him around , and then had to defend himself immediately from a vicious rain of blows , which stopped only when the other 32 A SHORT , SHARP SHOCK treefolk threw themselves between the two , protesting in anxious mutters , whispering shh , shh , shhh . "
9762	9767	9759	9759	you	118	" Thel cried softly . "
9770	9777	9759	9759	you	118	” Julo said between his teeth . "
9786	9787	9780	9780	you	118	" "
9792	9818	9780	9780	you	118	” Julo turned away , clearly too disgusted and furious to discuss it further . With a fierce chopping gesture he led the others away . "
9824	9895	9821	9822	the swimmer	117	" They did n't stop . Suddenly the black forest seemed filled with distant voices , with drunken bodies crashing into underbrush , with yellow winking torches bouncing through the trees . Thel backed into a tree , leaned against the shaggy bark . He took deep deliberate breaths . The cage had been made of lashed branches , but out in the center of the clearing like that . ... "
9901	9914	9896	9896	I	0	" Garth said out of the darkness , giving Thel a start . “
9921	9932	9919	9919	Garth	35	" They held each other 's forearms in the dark . “
9942	9946	9947	9947	I	0	" Thel said . “
9950	9959	9947	9947	I	0	" Garth said , voice low and bitter . "
9989	9990	9982	9982	my	0	" “
9998	10044	9982	9982	my	0	" Thel said . Without replying Garth turned back the way they had come , and they crept back to the clearing . Once there they lay behind a fallen log and looked into the firelit cages . Garth 's fellow folk sat there listlessly . "
10052	10053	10055	10055	your	118	" "
10058	10059	10055	10055	your	118	" "
10066	10067	9982	9982	my	0	" “
10070	10228	9982	9982	my	0	" Garth slipped away , and after a time Thel saw an orange light like a sort of firefly bobbing through the trees : Garth , holding a branch tipped by a glowing ember . Thel joined him , and they crept to the back of the treefolk 's cage , and Garth held the tip of the branch to the lashings at the bottom of one pole . As they blew on the coal the treefolk KIM STANLEY ROBINSON 33 inside watched , without a sound or any sign of interest . Garth begged those inside to emerge , and got no reply . Thel stared at the orange ember which brightened as they blew on it , embarrassed for Garth , and worried about what he could do alone . When the cage lashing caught fire with a miniature explosion of white flame , Garth looked at his comrades through the smoke and said fiercely , “
10301	10313	10321	10321	them	56	" He jerked hard on the pole and it came loose . "
10334	10382	10327	10327	you	123	" One of them started forward and crawled under the lifted pole , and the rest looked at each other , at the raw stumps protruding from their shoulders ; they too slipped from the cage . In a moment they had all disappeared into the dark . "
10397	10403	10404	10405	The ember	127	" Garth said to Thel . “
10409	10410	10404	10405	The ember	127	" “
10420	10421	10422	10422	My	0	" "
10427	10428	10422	10422	My	0	" "
10435	10439	10429	10429	They	128	" Garth nodded . “
10455	10637	10449	10449	they	56	” And he disappeared again . Thel waited , as near the swimmer 's cage as he could get without emerging into the light . From the hut beside the bonfire and the central cage came the sounds of laughter , then those of an argument turning ugly . Around him in the forest were odd noises , sudden silences , and he imagined the treeless treefolk wandering murderously in the dark , jumping drunken guards as they stumbled off to piss in the trees , bludgeoning them and then stealing their swords to slip between the ribs of others . The spine kings feared no one and now they would pay , ambushed in their own village in the 34 A SHORT , SHARP SHOCK FENNER midst of their death bacchanal . Sick with images of brutal murder , keyed to the highest pitch of tension , Thel leaped to his feet involuntarily as a crash and cries came from the direction of the beach , and the guards in the clearing 's hut rushed out and down a path . "
10641	10873	10449	10449	they	56	" someone was shouting in the distance as Thel ran to the bonfire and snatched up a brand . Sparks streamed in a wide arc from the burning end as he ran to the cage and crushed the red ember tip against the lashings at the bottom of a pole . This cage was better constructed and it was going to take longer . A twig cracked behind him and the swimmer croaked a warning ; he swung the brand around and caught an onrushing guard in the face . The guard 's raised broadsword flew into the cage , cutting one prisoner who cried out ; the guard himself could n't do more than grunt , as Thel beat him furiously across the neck and head . When Thel turned back to the cage the prisoners had cut the lashing with the sword and were squeezing out of the cage and cursing one another under their breath . Thel took the swimmer woman by the arm and pulled her out ; she was thicker than the others and barely fit through the gap . She appeared dazed , but when Thel held her face in his hands and caught her eye , she recognized him . Garth had reappeared , and Thel was about to lead the swimmer out of the clearing when one of the other prisoners said urgently , "
10899	10958	10886	10886	I	0	" So they followed him , but it seemed to Thel he went straight for the center of the camp . Shrieks cut the night and torches had been tossed high into the trees , some of which had caught fire and become great torches themselves , so that there was far too much light for their purpose . “
10964	11056	10886	10886	I	0	" the prisoner who claimed to know the way said , and he ran into the largest house in the camp . Apparently some of the treefolk amputees had found the flex X and set it alight . The crater wall enclosing the lagoon appeared out of the darkness , faintly illuminated by the burning village . Sparks wafted among the stars , it seemed 3 A SHORT , SHARP SHOCK 6 the cosmos was winking out fire by fire . The prisoner ran out of the house carrying a sack . "
11061	11066	11058	11058	me	0	" he cried jubilantly , “
11073	11331	11332	11332	We	133	" They ran after him . Thel took the swimmer by the arm , determined not to lose her in the mayhem . But now the prisoner was true to his word , and he led them through firebroken shadows to a wide cobbled trail , ignoring the shouts and cries around them . The trail ran up to the crater 's rim and then along it , to the point where the crater wall diverged from the great slope of the spine ridge . The trail began to switchback up the slope . Looking across an arc of the lagoon they saw the village dotted with burning trees and smaller patches of fire , the flex X burning high on a beach glossy as a seal 's back , and there were two images of everything : one burning whitely over the beach , another , inverted , burning a clear yellow in the calm black water of the bay . KIM STANLEY ROBINSON 37 C Η Α Ρ Τ Ε R Ε Τ G H I The Mirror fraid of the spine king 's pursuit , they ran the trail west for many days , scarcely pausing to loot caches located by the prisoner who led them . The caches contained clothing and shoes , and also buried jugs of dried meat and fruit , lumps so hard and dry they could n't tell what anything was until chewing it ; good food , but because there were seven of them they were still hungry . “
11340	11410	11332	11332	We	133	" the prisoner said one evening after doling out a meager dinner , and outfitting Thel and the swimmer in pants and tunics , and boots that were a lucky fit . The prisoner 's name was Tinou , and he had a wonderful big smile ; he seemed astonished and delighted to have escaped the spine kings , and often he thanked Thel and Garth for their rescue . “
11426	11674	11415	11415	we	133	" The sun had set an hour before , and a line of clouds over the western horizon was the pink of azaleas , set in a sky the color of lapis . The seven sat around a small fire : Thel , the swimmer , Garth , Tinou , and three women . These women all had faces cast in the same mold , and a strange mold it was ; KIM STANLEY ROBINSON 39 where their right eye should have been the skin bulged out into another , smaller face , lively and animated , with features that did not look like the larger one around it - except for the fact that its own little right eye was again replaced by a face , a very little face — which had an even tinier face where its right eye should have been , and so on and so on , down in a short curve to the limit of visibility , and no doubt beyond . This oddity made the three women 's faces impressive and even frightening , and because the three full - sized faces seldom spoke , Thel always felt that when talking to them he was really conversing with one of the smaller faces — perhaps the very smallest , beyond the limit of visibility — who might reply in a tiny high squeak at any time . But now the three women stood before Tinou , and one said , “
11686	11687	11688	11688	I	0	" "
11693	11697	11688	11688	I	0	" Tinou said , "
11703	11704	11688	11688	I	0	" "
11711	11731	11688	11688	I	0	" the middle woman said , her voice heavy and slow . Her companions moved to Tinou 's sides . “
11738	11783	11688	11688	I	0	" In the dusk it was hard to tell if expressions or firelight were flickering across Tinou 's long and mobile face . Thel and the swimmer leaned forward together to see better this small confrontation , and Tinou flashed them his friendly smile . “
11792	11808	11784	11784	I	0	" he said , and picked uphis shoulder bag . Untying the drawstring he said , “
11811	11828	11784	11784	I	0	" and slipped something out of the bag , a small shiny plate of some sort . "
11831	11840	11784	11784	I	0	" the middle facewoman said . Tinou nodded . “
11865	11912	11784	11784	I	0	" He held it up — a round smooth mirror with no rim , the glass of it golden rather than silver . Held up against the dark eastern sky it gleamed like a lamp , revealing a rich blue line in a field of pink . “
11919	11923	11784	11784	I	0	" Tinou said . “
11940	12508	11936	11936	I	0	" 4 A SHORT , SHARP SHOCK 0 He put it back in the bag , and for a moment it seemed to Thel he was stuffing light into the bag as well , until with a hard jerk he closed the drawstring . Wind riffled over them , below lay the calm surface of the sea , and in the east the moon rose , its blasted face round and brilliant ; looking from it to the quick yellow banners of their fire , Thel suddenly felt he walked in a world of riches . Night beach and big - handed children , running the mirrorflake road on the sea .... The next dawn they were off again . At first Thel had been shy of the swimmer , even a bit frightened of her ; she could n't know how important her image had been to him before the rescue , and he did n't know what to say to her . But now he walked behind her or beside her , depending on the width of the trail , and as they walked he asked her questions . Who was she ? What did she remember from before the night they had washed onto the beach ? What had gotten them to that point under the water ? What was her name ? She only shook her head . She remembered the night on the beach ; beyond that she was unable to say . She concentrated her gaze on her long feet , which seemed to have trouble negotiating the rock , and rarely looked at him . He did n't mind . It was a comfort to be walking with her and to know that someone shared the mystery of his arrival on the peninsula . She was a fellow exile , moving like a dancer caught in heavier gravity than she was used to , and it was a pleasure just to watch her as the sun roasted her brown hair white at the tips , and burned her pale skin red - brown . Often aspects of her reminded Thel of that first night : the set of her rangy shoulders , the profile of her long nose . With speech or without , she reassured him . And Garth - Garth too was an exile , a new one , and he hiked with them but in himself , skittish , distracted , sad . Thel hiked with him as well , and told him more stories of the rock under their feet , and Garth nodded to show he was listening ; but he was n't entirely there . The leaves on his little tree drooped , as if they needed watering . So they moved westward , and the peninsula got steep and narrow again , the granite as hard as iron and a gray KIM STANLEY ROBINSON 1 4 near black , flecked with rose quartz nodules . The dropoffs on both sides became so extreme that they could see nothing but a short curved slope of rock , and then ocean , a few thousand feet below . Tinou told them that here the walls of the sea cliffs were concave , so that they walked on a tube of rock that rested on a thin vertical sheet of stone , layered like an onion . "
12512	12555	11936	11936	I	0	" Thel said . Tinou nodded , interested , and went on to say that in places the two cliffsides had fallen away to nothing , so that they were walking on arches over open holes , called the Serpent 's Gates . “
12586	12744	13102	13102	Thel	33	" Instead they tramped a trail set right down the edge of a fishback ridge . In places the trail had been hacked waistdeep into the dense dark rock , to give some protection from falls . Every day Tinou said they were getting close to his village , and to support the claim ( for somehow his cheerful assurances made Thel doubt him ) , the trail changed under their feet , shifting imperceptibly from barely touched broken rock to a loose riprap , and then to cobblestones set in rings of concentric overlapping arcs , and finally , early one morning shortly after they started off , to a smoothly laid mosaic , made of small polished segments of the rose quartz . Longer swirls of dark hornblende were set into this pink road , forming letters in a cursive alphabet , and Tinou sang out the words they spelled in a jubilant tenor , the "
12751	13033	13126	13126	He	33	" as he explained , fluid syllables like the sound of a beach stream 's highest gurgling . At one point for their benefit he sang in the language they all shared : We walk the edge of pain and death And carve in waves our only hearth And nothing ever brings us home But something makes us want to climb : The sight of water cut like stone A village hanging in the sky . 4 A SHORT , SHARP SHOCK 2 A village hanging in the sky And nothing ever brings us home But something makes us climb . And climb they did , all that long day , until they came over a rise in the ridge , and there facing the southern sea , tucked in a steep scoop in the top of the cliff , was a cluster of whitewashed blocky buildings , lined in tight rows so that the narrow lanes were protected from the wind . Terrace after terrace cut the incurved slope , until it reached an escarpment hanging over the sea ; from there a white staircase zigzagged down a gully to a tiny harbor below , three white buildings and a dock , gleaming like a pendant hanging from Oia . KIM STANLEY ROBINSON 4 3 CH A P T E R NINE The Sorcerers of Oia crowd greeted them as they entered the village , men and women convening almost as though by coincidence , as though if Tinou and his retinue had not appeared they would have gathered anyway ; but when they saw Tinou they smiled , for the most part , and congratulated him on his return . “
13041	13079	13080	13080	I	0	" one woman said , and laughing the others crushed in on them to touch Tinou and his companions , while Tinou sang the trail 's mosaic song , ending with an exuberant leap in the air . "
13089	13093	13082	13082	I	0	" he cried , "
13136	13145	13146	13146	He	33	" Jubilantly he embraced Thel , then added , “
13159	13213	13146	13146	He	33	" and he took the mirror out of his shoulder bag . Silence fell , and the crowd seemed both to step back and to press in at once . Thel thought he could hear the sound of the sea , murmuring far below . A woman dressed in a saffron dress said , “
13232	14388	14390	14390	you	148	" General laughter , and then they were being led into the narrow streets of the village . These either contoured across town , making simple arcs , or ascended it in steep marble staircases , each step bowed in the middle from centuries of wear . Every lane and alley was lined by blocky whitewashed buildings , often painted with the graceful cursive lettering . By the time they came to a tiny plaza on the far side of the village , the sun was low on the horizon , it broke under clouds and suddenly every west wall was as gold as Tinou 's mirror , and many of the west - facing windows were blinding white . Restaurants ringed the plaza , each sporting a cluster of outdoor tables , and as dusk seeped into things lanterns were hung in small gnarled trees or put on windowsills , and the people ate and drank long into the night . Thel and the swimmer and the three facewomen ate voraciously , and became drunk on the fiery spirits poured for them , and the villagers danced , their long pantaloons and dresses swirling like the colors in a kaleidoscope , yards of cloth spinning under strong wiry naked torsos , both men and women dancing like gods , so that the watchers were shocked when a bottle shattered and the color of blood spurted into their field of vision , off to the side ; a fight , quickly broken up , overridden by the gaiety of the sorcerers of Oia . The mirror was back . In the days that followed , the celebration continued . Eventually it became clear that this was the permanent state of things in Oia , that this was the way the sorcerers lived . They poured sea water into stone vats , and later drew their spirits from taps at the vats ' bottoms . Sea lions brought them their daily fish in exchange for drinks of this liquor ; the creatures swam right up to the dock at the cliff bottom , barking hoarsely as they deposited long three - eyed fish on the dock . Later the sorcerers turned some of the fish meat into tough dark red steak , which tasted nothing like the flaking fish . Their gardens and goats were tended by their 4 A SHORT , SHARP SHOCK 6 children — and in short , they lived lives of leisure , playing complex games , undergoing abstruse studies , and performing rituals and ceremonies . Tinou took his fellow travelers with him wherever he went , and introduced them as his saviours , and they were fêted to exhaustion . One day to escape it Thel and the swimmer walked down the staircase trail that switch - backed precipitously to the sea . On the way they passed grown - over foundations , and roofless walls filled with weeds : vestiges of earlier Oias , shaken by earthquakes into the sea . On the dock below some of the sorcerers stood talking to the sea lions , taking their bloody catch and pouring tankards of the liquor down their throats . Even their vilest imprecations could n't keep a flock of gulls away , and the gulls wheeled overhead crying madly until the barking sea lions breached far into the air , thick sleek sluglike bodies twisting adroitly as they snagged birds and crushed them in their small powerful mouths . Eventually the gulls departed and the lions swam off , a wrack of feathered corpses left on the groundswell . After they were gone , Thel and the swimmer shed their garments and dove in . Underwater Thel became instantly afraid , but the sight of the swimmer stroking downward was somehow familiar , and strangely reassuring . He stayed under for as long as he could hold his breath , and then joined her in body - surfing the groundswells that rose up to strike the cliffs . As the two rode the waves they remained completely inside the water , surfing as the sea lions did , and they were drawn swiftly forward in the wave until they ducked down and out to avoid crashing into the cliff or the dock . During these rides , slung through the water by two curves of spacetime rushing across each other , Thel would look over at the swimmer 's long naked body and feel his own flowing in the water , until it was hard to hold his breath , not because he was winded but because he needed to shout for joy . When they pulled themselves back onto the worn stones of the dock , Tinou was there , except now he was a woman , laughing in a contralto at their expressions as she KIM STANLEY ROBINSON 4 7 stripped and dove in ; her face was clearly Tinou 's , unmistakable despite the fact that it was slimmer , more feminineyet clearly not a sister or twin , no , nothing but Tinou himself , shape - changed into a svelte female form . Thel and the swimmer looked at each other , baffled by this transformation ; and halfway through the long climb up the stairs Tinou caught up with them , a man again , coquettishly embracing first the swimmer and then Thel ( slim wet arms quick around his shoulders ) , and then laughing uproariously at their expressions . That sunset he led them and the facewomen down into the ruins of the previous village . Here broken buildings had dropped their barrel roofs onto their floors , and worn splintered sticks of old furniture still stuck out between the bowed bricks . Other sorcerers set lanterns in a circle around what appeared to be an abandoned plaza , smaller even than the one above , and in the long lavender dusk more of the sorcerers gathered , somber for once and drinking hard . In the sky above a windhover caught the last rays of the sun , a white kestrel turned pink by the sunset , fluttering its wings in the rapid complex pattern that allows it to stay fixed in the air . Tinou took the stolen mirror from his bag and set it on a short wooden stand , on the eastern edge of the circle the sorcerers made . Against the starry east it was a circle of pure pink sheen . When Tinou sat down the circle of seated sorcerers was complete , and they began to sing , their faces upturned to the windhover riding the last rays of the sun . The light leaked out of the sky and the wind riffled the enormous space of dusk and the sea , and Thel , surprising himself , feeling the old compulsion , said "
14420	14427	14405	14405	you	148	" They all stared at him . “
14434	14443	14390	14390	you	148	" Tinou said finally in a kind tone , "
14449	14476	14390	14390	you	148	" Another voice took over , that of an old woman ; but it was impossible to pick out the speaker from the circle of faces . “
14592	14593	14590	14590	God	38	" “
14599	14614	14700	14701	the speaker	1461	" said the voice of an old man , a cold , hard voice , “
14638	14697	14700	14701	the speaker	1461	“ Gods fly through space in bubbles of glass , and their powers exceed ours as ours exceed those of the stones we stand on , who know only to endure . And once long ago gods voyaged through this forgotten bay of the night sea , and to pass the time they argued a point of philosophy . "
14738	14836	14700	14701	the speaker	1461	" They argued aesthetics , the most metaphysical of philosophical problems . One of them said that beauty was a quality of the universe independent of any other , that it was inlaid in the fabric of being like gravity , in a pattern that no one could pull out . Another disagreed : beauty is the ache of mortality , this god said , an attribute of consciousness , and nothing is beautiful except perceived through the love of lost time , so that wherever there is beauty , love was there also , and first . "
14849	14937	14700	14701	the speaker	1461	" And so they agreed to put it to a test , and being gods and therefore just like us , less ignorant but no less cruel , they decided to transform and populate one of the planets they sailed by , sinking all its land but this spine under an endless sea , and then making what remained as beautiful as they could imagine ; but leeching every living thing of love , to see if the beauty would yet remain . And here we are . "

15099	15106	15096	15096	Tinou	37	" we must hurry a little . "

15340	15351	15352	15352	They	164	" There are so many kinds of pain , really . "
15361	15449	15352	15352	They	164	" Is it pulsing , throbbing , shooting , lancing , cutting , stabbing , scalding ? Is it pressing , gnawing , cramping , wrenching , burning , searing , ripping ? Is it smarting , stinging , pricking , pounding , itching , 50 A SHORT , SHARP SHOCK freezing , drilling ? Is it superficial or profound ? Can you think of anything else ? Can you tell me what eight times six equals ? Can you take a full breath and hold it ? "
15516	15559	15494	15494	Tinou	37	" Is it dull , sore , taut , tender ? Is it rasping , splitting , exhausting , sickening ? Is it suffocating , frightful , punishing ? Vicious , wretched ? Blinding ? Horrible ? Killing ? Excruciating ? Unbearable ? "

17883	17887	17888	17888	She	117	“ After that ... "
17892	18053	17888	17888	She	117	“ The spine kings attacked and everything caught fire . The sorcerers left you on the plaza , and the mirror as well . We picked you up and carried you KIM STANLEY ROBINSON 59 away , and took the mirror too . Then you woke and told us to follow you , and we did . We climbed out on the cliff face beside Oia to escape the sorcerers and the spine kings , and the next night we climbed to the spine and started west . You talked most of the time but we could n't see who you talked to . Garth carried the mirror . The spine dropped into a forest and you ran all the way , and we chased you . Then it seemed you were never going to see us , and so Garth said we should push you back through the mirror . We did that and you fell through , unconscious — "
18055	18063	17888	17888	She	117	" You could just push me through ? "
18064	18147	18148	18149	The others	1143	“ No , it would n't work at first , it was hard as glass when I tried it , but Garth said it had to be at sunset , on the spine , with a kessel hawk hunting in the western sky . We waited three days until we saw one , and then it worked . But after we got you through you were asleep again . So we waited and then we fell asleep too . I 'm hungry . "
18491	18499	18500	18500	Thel	33	“ We 'll reach your folk soon ? "
18505	18527	18500	18500	Thel	33	“ No . Many days . But when we do , you can continue on your way speeded by our horses . "

19858	19879	19819	19821	The old women	301	" Yes . More powerful than that , in fact . But that is sufficient to see the spine kings . "
19932	19938	19912	19912	He	33	" They 're far behind . ”
19939	20019	20020	20020	They	305	" They stopped for other business . They will be here in a few days , at their pace . They will certainly come .

20679	20856	20875	20875	Thel	33	“ A man in a bubble , flying through the stars . Others like you and not like you . When you were a child , you lived by a lake . The lake was circular and had high cliffs surrounding it . One day you tried to climb the steepest cliff , and fell . You hit the water feet first and survived the impact , plunging deep . The water of the lake was said to be bottomless and so when your feet hit a submerged outcropping of the cliff you were astonished , and in that state of panic these moments of your future came to you , intense as any memory , for every vision is a memory , and every memory a vision of a world that never existed until called up in the mind . You saw then your immersion in our ocean , your step through the mirror , your stand before our glass , the fire behind you , all of it seen in that instant . Remember ? "
20871	20874	20875	20875	Thel	33	“ Yes , "

21627	21651	21652	21652	Thel	33	“ More grass , more fruit . Really . Please . We ca n't afford to spend all day on the beach foraging . "
21655	21680	21681	21681	He	35	" If we stopped in the later afternoon instead of at dusk , we could forage more , and you could eat more too . "
21938	21979	21981	21981	he	35	“ I was told tales of this , how one of us could grow enough to sustain his fellows in a time of need . Like having children , they always said , and now I know what they mean . "

22214	22298	22211	22211	Garth	35	“ It 's the water gate . I 've heard stories about it . Look out there , see that smudge ? It 's the other cape , where the peninsula proper begins again . In between is a tidal bar . This is the lowest part of the spine , KIM STANLEY ROBINSON 7 1 nothing more . At low tide a strip of sand will emerge as fine as any road , and stay above the waves for half the day . "
22462	22470	22471	22471	Garth	35	“ The horses ca n't cross that , "
22474	22483	22471	22471	Garth	35	“ The rock would tear up their hooves . "
22484	22497	22498	22499	the swimmer	117	" But surely it 's more than one tide 's walk across ? "
22505	22520	22502	22502	Garth	35	“ Still we must send the horses back , as we said we would . "
22652	22821	22645	22645	He	35	“ I am Birsay the guide . It is more than one tide 's walk to cross the brough , as you noted . This is how we do it ; there is a rise near the halfway point , and we run to that in one low tide , on a path that I have built . It is just possible , though you get your legs wet . There on the rise I have left several large holed rocks . We tie ropes I have made to those anchors , and as the water 7 A SHORT , SHARP SHOCK 2 rises we rise on it , floated by slings I have made of kelp bladders and wood . The current pushes us out , usually to the south , but we are tied by the ropes to the anchor rocks , and when the tide ebbs , we float down to a landing , and complete the crossing of the brough to the other cape . "
22822	22830	22831	22831	Thel	33	" Why have you made these things ? "
22834	22841	22831	22831	Thel	33	" Why do you do this ? "
22849	22951	22952	22952	He	386	“ The peninsula extends around the world , and there is no land but it . And this is the only place in its circumference where the sea has chewed the peninsula down almost to its level . And naturally the peninsula must be passable . Traders come through , and circumnavigators on pilgrimages — believers of more religious persuasions than I 'd care to recall . It is simply the natural order of things . The land itself calls forth a guide to sustain that order , and I am the forty - ninth reincarnation of that guide , Birsay . "
23074	23086	23087	23087	Birsay	41	“ You spend almost half a day suspended in the tide , "
23090	23137	23087	23087	Birsay	41	“ The water is warm , though by the end it does n't feel so . The bath is good for the skin . Then the distance from the rise to the western cape is not as great as the distance from here to the rise . "
23148	23156	23145	23145	Garth	35	" When would you have us leave ? "
23157	23192	23145	23145	Garth	35	" We 've wasted too much of this ebb . And they are getting longer every day now , for twenty more days . The next one will begin in the dark before dawn . "
23193	23199	23200	23200	Thel	33	" The next , then , "
23370	23380	23381	23381	Thel	33	" Do you guide all travelers that appear here ? "
23384	23388	23381	23381	Thel	33	" I do . "
23389	23395	23330	23330	He	41	" You make no distinctions ? "

23432	23498	23500	23500	he	33	“ Well , I wish you all speed . I make no distinctions of that kind , no . Good , evil , right , wrong — they are personal matters , shifting from one to the next . These murderers may regard themselves as righteous folk , and you as great criminals perhaps , thieves of something they cherish , perhaps , who knows ? "
23513	23531	23500	23500	he	33	“ How am I to judge ? By your stories ? By the looks on your faces ? "
23543	23599	23532	23532	He	33	“ My task is to lead travelers across the low point in the world road . Their purposes , their identity - none of my concern .

The sea 's ideas were bubbles , and one bubble idea she called love , and all the water in the universe fell into that bubble , taking all the other gods with it . Most drowned , but two learned to swim , and these were the gods rock and dragon . These two loved the sea goddess , and for ages they swam in her and the three were lovers , and all was well until dragon went away , and came back and found rock plunged to ocean 's very center , an embrace dragon could never know , for rock did not need to breathe , and dragon did . And in a rage dragon flew away and grew as big as the sky , and reached back with one bony hand and clenched it around the two lovers , cutting through ocean 's body to grasp rock and strangle him . And rock died ; and the sea goddess , cut in half , died ; and seeing his two lovers dead , dragon died . And the bubble burst , leaving nothing but a theater of ghosts . And the lovers ' bodies rotted , until nothing of dragon was left but his skeleton ; nothing of rock but his heart ; nothing of ocean but her salty blood . And ages later dragon 's skeleton broke away and flew off through the empty sky , scattering its bones that are the stars . Only the bones of the hand which had strangled the lovers remained here , wrapping the round drop of ocean 's blood , cutting it down to rock . All who live on the remains of these three are accidental vermin , walking an edge of 102 A SHORT , SHARP SHOCK bone , which is highest at the old wristbones , and nearly submerged where forefinger once met thumb . We live by drinking ocean , eating rock , and standing on the dragon 's bones . "

37297	37360	37290	37291	Old Paros	49	“ This is a story from the world 's beginning , when ocean never equalled gleamed in the dark , perfect and white and empty . Across her white body sailed a raft , not our ship of fools but an orderly and good society , the brown and the purple having little to do with each other but coexisting in peace . ”
37369	37428	37361	37364	Some of the villagers	884	" But one day one a brown man and a purple woman met at the mast , and talked , and later they did it again , and again , and when the browns and the purples bathed over the side they dove under the raft and swam together for a time ; and they fell in love . “
37475	37561	37457	37461	all the browns and purples	889	" But the raft sailed by an island in the white sea , the smallest speck of land — a rock , a tree , a shell and a stream . And the browns and purples decided to maroon the two lovers , and threw them overboard , and the two swam to the island . And as they swam , ocean never equalled seeped into their minds and took all memory of the raft away from them , so that they would not despair . "
37684	38338	38339	38339	We	904	" Silence . Paros sat down . Gray film fluttered on the dull coals of the fire . Thel felt as though he were falling , he had to clasp the swimmer 's arm to steady himself , even though they were sitting . Later as they walked back home he stumbled once or twice , though he had not drunk that much . And several times he started to speak , and stopped ; and he noticed the swimmer did the same . And that night in their narrow bed they hugged each other like two frightened children , lost at night in the woods . KIM STANLEY ROBINSON 123 CHAPTER TWENTY - SIX We Are Clouds ays passed . In the summer the shallows got so hot that they had to swim offshore to get any refreshment from the sea , and they searched for shells naked , as brown as the brown shellfolk . In the winter the water was so cold that it hurt their ankles as it rushed over their feet , and each day their skin turned as purple as the purple shellfolk , teeth chattering so that the fire in their bedroom was a lovely warmth . They spent storm days sitting in the bed watching the fire and talking and making love , while wind and rain lashed at their streaming window . Days like that were wonderful to Thel , but better yet were the long summer days , knee deep in surf under the sun , the intense rays pulsing on his neck in what felt like discrete little pushes of light and heat . He would look up from the sand tumbling in the whitewater and see the swimmer make some graceful move , her naked brown body twisting as she dove for a blue fragment , or streaming with water as she stood up after a dive ; or the muscles of her arms rippling like backwash hitting an oncoming wave ; or the sight of her legs and bottom and back as she walked away down the beach ; or the KIM STANLEY ROBINSON 125 tilt of her head as she walked toward him , looking down at the whitewater ; and his heart would swell like an erection inside him and he would run through the broken surf and tackle her , kissing her neck and face until she laughed at him and they would make love there , with water and sand running over them . And sometimes she would run up and tackle him and they would do the same . And afterwards they would play grunion in the surf , lying in the shorebreak and rolling up and down with the broken waves , taking the sea in and spurting it out like fountains , not thinking a thing . Every part of the day eternal , on summer days like that . But the sun moved , and time passed nevertheless . Sitting in the shorebreak and watching his lover roll back and forth like beautifully rounded driftwood , Thel could n't help thinking of that , from time to time ; of time passing : and he wished he could be a man of bronze , unchanging , living the same day over and over . He would have chosen that day . Looking across the bay , he saw clouds rushing over the granite boulders of the point . Both granite and cloud had deeply complex textured surfaces , but it was startling to think how different they were in their mutability . Each moment the clouds changed and would never be the same ; while the point rocks would remain much as they were now , ages after he and the swimmer were forever gone . Reflecting on this he was surprised when she rolled into him on a wave and said , “
38343	38354	38339	38339	We	904	" And even more surprised when he heard himself reply , “
38362	38621	38339	38339	We	904	" 126 A SHORT , SHARP SHOCK CHAPTER TWENTY - SEVEN An Old Coin nother day , in late autumn , Thel was standing in the surf , hunting pukas in the colorful tumbling retreat of a wave , when he saw a bright flash — something metallic — and his pounce , trained now to a fine accuracy , brought it up in his sand - streaming hands : an old coin , worn almost smooth but still bright , a color between the gold of the mirror 's surface and the bronze of a bronze sunset . One side held the profile of a head , and holding it up to see it better , Thel caught sight of his swimmer with her close - cropped head in profile some yards away ; and it was exactly her profile on the coin . The same strong nose , full mouth , distinct jaw , high forehead : as exact an image as a black paper silhouette cut by a sidewalk artist , in some life he could not otherwise remember . It had to be her . And yet the coin was obviously ancient , the remnant of a long dead civilization . Thel pocketed the coin , and that night in their shell cottage he put it on the brick mantle of their chimney , next to the spot where light occasionally pulsed through the wall , from the mirror hung in the next chamber . He said to KIM STANLEY ROBINSON 127 the swimmer , "
38632	38633	38623	38623	you	906	" “
38636	38641	38623	38623	you	906	" she muttered sleepily . “
38647	38679	38643	38643	I	0	” But this , he supposed , was another of their misunderstandings . Thel had first noticed this phenomenon when he had seen a windhover , hunting over the meadows inland . “
38682	38687	38688	38689	a kestrel	909	" he had said , “
38691	38776	38688	38689	a kestrel	909	" But the swimmer had thought him crazy for pointing into the sky , for that to her was the name of a kind of fish . And later he found that when he said loyalty she understood it to mean stubbornness , and when she said arbitrary she meant beautiful , and that when she said melancholy she did not mean that sadness we enjoy feeling , but rather mendacity ; and when she said actually she meant currently ; and when he said "
38781	38787	38777	38777	I	0	" she thought he was saying “
38793	39190	38788	38788	I	0	" They had slowly worked up quite a list of these false cognates , Thel could recite scores and scores of them , and he had come to understand that they did not share a language so much as the illusion of a language ; they spoke strong idiolects , and lived in worlds of meaning distinct and isolated from the other . So that she no doubt understood queen of an ancient kingdom to mean something like a swimmer in the deep sea ; and the mystery of the ancient alloy coin was never explained , and , he realized , never would be . It gave him a shiver of fear , thinking about it - it seemed to him that nothing would ever be explained , and that all of a sudden each day was slipping away , that time was flying by and they were getting old and nothing would ever come clear . He sat on the beach watching the clouds tumble overhead and letting handfuls of sand run through his fingers , the little clear grains of quartz , flecks of black mica , pieces of coral , shell fragments like small bits of hard ceramic , and he saw that a substantial portion of the sand was made of shells , that living things had labored all their lives to create ceramic shelters , homes , the most permanent parts of themselves ; which had then been pummelled into shards just big enough to see , millions upon millions of lives ground up and strewn under him , the beach made 128 A SHORT , SHARP SHOCK out of of the wreckage of generations . And before long he and the swimmer too would become no more than sand on a beach ; and they would never really have understood anything KIM STANLEY ROBINSON 129 CHAPTER TWENTY - EIGHT Festival ne evening in early spring , after a long day on the hot tawny beach , Thel and the swimmer walked homeward , between great logs of driftwood that had washed ashore in the winter . In the blue twilight the logs looked like the bodies of fallen giants after a titanic battle , and above them in the sky a black star was fluttering , a bird high in the air . The swimmer clasped Thel 's arm : “
39193	39203	39204	39204	We	911	" she said , and pointed down the beach . “
39208	39251	39206	39206	visitors	912	" Torchlight glimmered around their shell home , a dozen points of yellow weaving in the dusk . It was a group of the shellfolk , drinking liquor from curved shells and laughing as they danced in a circle around their home . "
39259	39264	39206	39206	visitors	912	" the swimmer asked . "
39268	39605	39206	39206	visitors	912	" Thel said . They walked into the circle of light , and the shellfolk greeted them and explained it was Paros 's birthday , and , as had happened once or twice before , they had decided to celebrate out at Thel and the swimmer 's home , because they had not been able to agree whether brown or purple should KIM STANLEY ROBINSON 1 31 host . So Thel and the swimmer joined the party , and ate and danced around the bonfire , and drank the liquor until everything was bright with the colors of fire and night , and the faces of the shellfolk were like crude masks of their daytime selves . Thel stumbled as he swung his feet out in dance , and a face the brown nearest black appeared before him , harsh with laughter and some shouted curse he did n't understand . Then someone the purple nearest black darted from the side , trying to trip him ; Thel looked up and it seemed that people were not quite themselves , so that when Psara came out of their house holding the mirror overhead , Thel saw immediately that it was not Psara but Tinou . Tinou 's black skin was now purplish in tint , and his face was twisted into Psara 's visage , but with Tinou 's big grin on it , and Tinou 's shouting laugh . As the transformed shellfolk seized Thel and the swimmer by the arms and dragged them to Tinou , a part of Thel was distracted , wondering if Psara had been Tinou all along , waiting all these years for whatever unimaginable reason to reveal himself - or if he had recently arrived in the village , and for reasons equally beyond comprehension had taken over Psara 's form . In any case the voice was the same , and as Tinou placed the mirror in the wooden frame familiar from Oia , he laughed and said , “
39643	39725	39635	39635	Thel	33	" Thel struggled against the hands holding him down , but there were too many of them ; all his neighbors , faces gleaming yellow and their eyes big and hungry as they watched the other group lift the struggling swimmer and force her feet into the bright liquid surface of the mirror . Tinou laughed and began his litany of questions , face inches from hers , spittle flying over her as he shouted in a gross parody of solicitousness , "
39742	40099	39617	39617	you	913	" Thel was proud of her , the way she could hold her face rigid in a mask of stoic disgust , staring Tinou in the eye ; but his stomach was flip - flopping inside him as he saw the flesh of 132 _ A SHORT , SHARP SHOCK her legs and torso jerk at the contact with the mirror . Her body remained visible on the other side , flesh pale and inert yet still there among them . But remembering his own voyage on the other side , Thel feared they would be separated again , separated for good , and as her head popped through and she tumbled unconscious to the ground behind the mirror , Thel ripped convulsively away from the hands holding him and leaped forward to dive head first through the mirror and after her . The last thing he saw was Tinou 's face , bright with torchlight and astonishment , as big around as the mirror itself . 1 34 A SHORT , SHARP SHOCK CHAPTER TWENTY - NINE The Pursuit t was early morning , sun bright in his eyes . The swimmer lay next to him , sleeping or unconscious , and the world smelled as fresh as the shadows under trees . It hurt to move — to raise his head , to sit up - each joint a stab of pain when he moved it . Nevertheless he was happy to be with her still . And yet it hurt , it hurt to move . This was an aspect of pain he noticed at once : it was hard to see through it to anything else . It took a discipline that would have to be learned . Groaning , he rolled to her side and shook her awake . She woke with a gasp and held her left arm to her side . They sat up , looked around at a cold windy hillside — the spine , in fact , near the crest , on a prominence overlooking the sea . There was no sign of the shellfolk 's bay . “
40103	40108	39617	39617	you	913	" the swimmer said . “
40121	40146	40210	40210	him	917	" Thel ignored the conundrum of how she could orient herself by something other than the sun in the sky , and merely nodded . “
40153	40157	40210	40210	him	917	" he said . “
40162	40205	40210	40210	him	917	" KIM STANLEY ROBINSON 135 They would need clothes , having been thrust into this world nearly naked . Even something like the leaf capes that the treefolk had worn would help shelter them from the wind . Then the swimmer pointed . “
40220	40249	40250	40250	He	917	" Far to the east , on the crest of the spine , a figure was walking away from them . It had a lump on its back . “
40256	40273	40250	40250	He	917	" the swimmer said . She had a hand shading her eyes , and was squinting . "
40282	40283	40276	40276	Tinou	37	" “
40286	40295	40276	40276	Tinou	37	” Thel peered after the tiny figure speculatively . "
40312	41093	41094	41094	We	920	" It might end the pain . It might return them to their hot tawny beach . It might . ... They looked each other in the eyes , stood with some difficulty , followed the figure east . It was hard going , even on the trail . At sunset each day they descended to the beach , the sun sinking into the eastern sea . Over time they wove capes of palm and fan seaweed ; and each night they foraged for food , and the swimmer found a mollusk that when eaten dulled the pain of her arm , and Thel 's joints . But the spine was getting higher and higher as they moved farther to the mirror east , and the trail stayed right on the crest of the spine , and the descent to the beaches became more difficult . Tinou stayed about the same distance ahead of them , so perhaps he was descending to water each night as well ; but finally one sunset it was impossible , and the next , possible but too strenuous to contemplate . Besides , in the dusk the swimmer caught sight of Tinou , sitting next to the trail far above them ; so they slept tucked in a fault to get out of the wind , and it was cold but they found bird 's nests , and were able to raid them for food . Holes and dips in the granite held rainwater for their thirst , and the swimmer had dried a collection of the mollusks for their pain . But they ran out quickly enough . Because the spine continued to rise they caught sight of Tinou several times a day , always most of a day 's walk ahead of them , a speck against the pinkish broken 136 A SHORT , SHARP SHOCK granite of the spine 's bony edge . The peninsula here resembled the precipitous blade of rock that Thel had traversed with the treefolk , a knife edge of scarcely weathered granite slicing the world ocean into two halves , so many thousands of feet high that the waves were no more than the faintest pattern of curves on the sea ; and yet if the peninsula had been nothing but dunes , it would have been only a morning 's walk to cross it from sea to sea . Higher and higher this great ridge arched into the sky , in irregular swoops , with many small ridge peaks , and an unhappily large number of sudden drops in the ridge line that they were forced to climb down , and then up again . As they made their way they sometimes saw broken bird nests scattered down the cliffs to right and left , the precious meat of eggs burst and dried over the rocks and sticks : Tinou had been kicking them apart as he passed , and so must have known they were following . When the swimmer 's mollusks were gone , they hiked on in pain ; her arm never healed , and Thel 's joints creaked as if filled with grit , and each day 's march added to their scrapes , bruises , sprains : and none of these ever seemed to heal . In the mirror world their bodies had lost that ability . Hunger plagued them as well , but not thirst ; some of the ponds they passed had Tinou 's feces floating in them , but there were more of the little granite pools than he could find to foul , and they drank as deeply as if they might be able to get their sustenance from water alone . They ate mice , and birds , and eggs , and once a whole glorious patch of blueberries ; then later , the bright green moss that Thel had found on the drawbridge . There was a lot of this moss as they climbed higher - moss , and blotchy lichen , and junipers and foxtail pines that up here were nothing but little wind - tortured bushes , tucked between boulders and down in cracks . They slept under these piney shrubs , and tried eating their cones but could n't . One evening in the indigo twilight Thel looked at the swimmer 's bright pain - filled eyes . It was hard to remember the world on the other side of the mirror , their life on the hot tawny beach — a blur , a moment like the snapping of KIM STANLEY ROBINSON 137 fingers , a dream . He said , “
41111	41119	41108	41108	My	0	" he stopped , wanting to cry . “
41124	41172	41120	41120	I	0	" he said instead . She gave him a handful of the moss . He noticed that her fingers were narrower and longer , with full webs of skin between them , and a dusting of blond fur over the backs of the hands . She said , “
41181	41234	41176	41176	you	0	" He ate , considering what that implied . His own hands were gnarled and his thumbs were longer and less opposed to the fingers than they used to be . Flickering , pulsing , throbbing , shooting , lancing , cutting , rasping , splitting , yes . All of these . “
41237	41249	41176	41176	you	0	" he said , feeling his face and the enlarged jaw , "
41307	41308	41273	41273	you	923	" “
41311	41329	41273	41273	you	923	" she said , sleepy . Her nose was smaller , and it twitched at the end . “
41342	42147	41273	41273	you	923	" So the next sunset they stopped and foraged hard , collecting for their waist bags a bit of everything that was not granite itself , and they kept walking as the sun 's light dimmed in the eastern sky , until only a few clouds high over the eastern sea caught a dim red glow in the deep indigo ; and then by the light of the million stars they stumbled on . Even in these remote heights the trail continued to wind its way along the spine crest , weaving to north or south depending on the shape of the rock and the cliffs on each side . The trail was in poor repair and had not been used , it appeared , in years . Sometimes , because it was the only flatness in a vertical landscape , and had been crushed to sand over the centuries , it was the only foothold for the green moss , so that a mossy path extended through the white rock , a highly visible black sidewalk in the starry night . Elsewhere the trail was just a slightly less obstacle - filled track of blasted rock , and nearly impossible to see . They kept losing 138 . A SHORT , SHARP SHOCK it and coming on it again , and each time they rediscovered it Thel felt a tiny bit of satisfaction , of communion across time with whoever had built the trail ; they had both picked the same route as best . And now it was essential that they keep to that route , if they were not to come to some impassable drop - off or rise ; so in places they moved on hands and knees , feeling for sand and the intangible traces of earlier feet . At times they could move their head to the side and stare straight down to the obsidian sea , flat and glossy some thousands of feet below ; then they crawled , happy to hug the rock , long past talk , merely panting , gasping , from time to time whimpering or cursing under their breath , or simply groaning . It was a long night . When dawn came and light leaked back into the world , in the hour when everything was made of translucent slabs of gray , Thel looked at the swimmer and observed that her whole shape was changing ; torso longer , feet longer , ribs visible but not quite human , she was making a slow transformation back to something clearly aquatic — as she had always been , but now it was more pronounced , obvious that her race had descended from some fluid water mammal . She would be forced to crawl all the time if the transformation continued . And if her joints felt anything like his . . . he exerted the discipline , peered through the black haze of pain , saw that his own legs were thicker and his arms longer and heavier : it was a comfortable prospect to walk on all fours , and climbing the endless granite staircase of the spine was in some senses a happy challenge . Tree ancestor , he thought , and the image of a quick beautiful creature came into his mind , with the word baboon . When the sun rose behind them , he looked at the ridge ahead carefully . This was the time of day when Tinou , looking back into the western dawn , would have trouble spotting them ; while they looked up the ridge for him with the blaze of a nearby star as their spotlight . And eventually Thel 's patience was rewarded . A head popped over the rock , just above and beyond them , a few minutes ' walk only , and KIM STANLEY ROBINSON 139 Tinou emerged , looked back blindly into the sun , and then hiked east up the ridge trail . All that day they hunted him , hiding when he looked back , and so losing some ground on him . In pain as they were they could not keep pace with him in any case . But after sunset they caught sight of him , settling for the night at a flat spot in the trail . There was still a trace of dusk in the sky when they crawled silently over the granite knobs to his camp . He was sleeping in the trail 's sand , rolled in a blanket , or so they thought ; but as they crept toward him his eyes opened , the whites reflecting starlight so that it seemed two glittery little jewels had popped into being , and with a laugh he said , "
42169	42176	42177	42177	My	0	" He was standing over them . “
42181	42195	42177	42177	My	0	" Amusement made his beautiful voice bounce musically , a low fast burble . "
42215	42227	42177	42177	My	0	" He loomedover Thel , and anger threaded into the amusement : “
42244	42302	42303	42303	We	925	" But Thel and the swimmer were long past the snare of language , long past even much hearing Tinou 's beautiful voice . He seemed to recognize this , for when they stood and approached him , spreading out to come at him from two sides , he retreated to the flat spot and his blanket . “
42308	42332	42303	42303	We	925	" Thel croaked , shuffling in toward him , sidling at angles in hopes of getting close more quickly than Tinou could notice . “
42344	42919	42303	42303	We	925	” Tinou laughed and reached down into his blankets , pulled out the mirror bag . He held it out , then swung it around to throw it over the cliff into the southern sea - but he had not reckoned on Thel 's new animal swiftness , and the bag crashed into Thel 's upper arm as Thel rushed forward , and quicker than Thel could react or plan his numbed arm had caught Tinou by the throat and the claws of his other hand were raking Tinou 's face and knocking aside the 140 A SHORT , SHARP SHOCK erpe FENNE flailing arms and then with tremendous force he caught up the sorcerer 's head in both hands and threw the man 's whole body to the ground . The swimmer dove and bit the bent and exposed neck , and awkwardly she got to her feet and they stood watching Tinou 's blood drain out of him . Mortality , how strange : that Tinou , who had given them so much , was now gone ! That he had left no more behind than this ! It was hard to grasp . Thel recovered the mirror bag and checked inside it ; the mirror was unbroken , its surface the color of the sky some hour or two before . Meanwhile the swimmer had taken a knife from Tinou 's bag , then found a firestone and clapper . The skeleton of a dead juniper stood twisted in the lee of boulders protecting the flat , and they broke it apart right down to the ground , bashing it with rocks they could barely lift . Thel started a fire while the swimmer cut away the skin over Tinou 's thighs and buttocks , and hacked out big steaks that they roasted on sticks of juniper . When they were full they slept all the way through to dawn , warmed by the coals of the fire , and their first real meal in weeks . 1.4 2 A SHORT , SHARP SHOCK С Н А Р Т Е п т н т п т ү The Green Flash en hey woke in the late morning and hiked on , continuing eastward without discussion ; it seemed clear to Thel that it was necessary , that they could not recross the mirror 's smooth barrier on the site of Tinou 's murder . That , in fact , there was a specific moment when it would be possible , a time and a place of which he knew nothing . They would have to watch . Without speaking of it he knew the swimmer had come to the same conclusion . So they hiked on . The spine continued to rise , a granite wall splitting the sea , curving sinuously left and right , its top edge shattered over the eons into a broken split serrated knife edge of a ridge , rising unevenly as they crawled ant - like along it . Often they crawled in the literal sense , as it was too painful and precipitous to walk . The moss grew less frequently here and they were often hungry , they often recalled the delicious meal of Tinou and regretted bitterly not staying to eat all of him , or at least not taking with them his heart and liver , they drooled thinking of it . "
42926	42930	42931	42931	someone	1281	” Thel said , "
42939	43270	42931	42931	someone	1281	" KIM STANLEY ROBINSON 1.43 Hunger made them light and they found they could almost float up smaller arêtes , just a touch here and there on the rough grainy rock , something to keep them from blowing away — to keep their shells from blowing away - everything inside having danced off on the wind . Once Thel tried to tell the swimmer how he felt about that , and he could n't find the words to express it . He listened to the thin slow trickle of his thoughts and was surprised to hear how simple it had become : I am climbing . I will always climb . The ocean is far below . That is a rock . I hope we find some moss . These were his thoughts . And all that great whirling maelstrom of feeling and significance , of meaning : on the other side of the mirror , back down the peninsula among his forgotten friends , adventures , hopes , loves , dreams . All the dreams forgotten in the moment of waking , the flight that mattered so much ... it was strange to no longer desire his desires , to look at the swimmer and see a broken ancient animal , to understand that all their love had been a way of fixing time , each embrace a moment 's touch of the eternal , because the caress preserves . And yet here he crawled , something like a baboon , long knuckled hairy claws at the end of furred forearms , next to something like an otter , and only her eyes remained hers , the face he remembered mostly gone , but all of it evoked by those calm black eyes unfogged by the pain that crippled her gait , clear and calm and looking around , still capable of that small ironic amused squint , as when she laid her forearm next to his and said , “
43280	43884	43272	43272	you	928	" They had come from different worlds . They spoke different languages . What they had shared had been at least partly illusion . And yet , and yet , and yet ... He took comfort in limping along the trail beside her , before her , behind her , thumping shoulders together or sharing moss they found . Beauty is only the beginning of terror , but just to have company , to share the news : there is a block of pink quartz . The seas look high . The wind is strong . And so the terror is staved off . Through black haze , beauty still perceived . The ridge became deeply serrated , peaks like the 144 A SHORT , SHARP SHOCK 6 teeth of a crude saw , making progress nearly impossible . Why go on ? , Thel thought one morning , but then the swimmer started off , scrambling up a broken cliff , using all fours , and he followed . Why was one of the questions that had gone away . Pain clouded his vision . A bird 's nest gave them a feast . A storm left them soaked and cold . Near its end lightning shattered the peak above them , leaving their ears blasted , their nerves tingling , the strong smell of ozone in the wind . The shock of it seemed to invigorate the swimmer and she led all the next day with a will , over peak after peak , and down into deep cols . Their bodies were continuing to devolve , and only this allowed them to continue ; now she could slither up rock , and how he could cling ! Then late one afternoon they made their way slowly over a hump of granite , and on the other side of it the peninsula dropped off into the sea , and came to an end . It did so in a sheer clean prow , so smooth that it had to have been crafted . Also there was a smoothed waist - high wall to each side , bowing in and meeting at an angle , at the final point of the ridge . They walked out to the meeting of the two walls and leaned out to look . Clearly in some past age some civilization had come here and cut the granite cape smooth , creating two polished curving walls that came together in a straight edge which dropped to the sea in a single swoop , a clean crease like the bowline of a great ship . It was a drop , Thel estimated , of about ten thousand feet . They walked around on this last forecastle , south to north and back again , looking down at the workmanship of the two cliffsides . The polished granite was a flecked color , an infinitely dense mix of feldspar , quartz , and hornblende , so that just below them it appeared speckled like a trout , while farther down it seemed only a pinkish brown , like a kind of marble . Stones that Thel dropped over the walls skipped down and disappeared , and he never even saw them mar the dark blue of the sea . It was nearly sunset . The swimmer wandered about , collecting rocks and laying them on the triangular block where the two walls met , the outermost point . Thel asked KIM STANLEY ROBINSON 1 4 5 what she was doing and she smiled , gesturing at the mirror bag . “
43893	44009	44051	44051	she	933	" Thel shivered , looked around . They could see for many , many miles , and the horizon was a clear sharp line between sea and sky ; but the air was somehow thick , the sunlight in it dark . He took the mirror from the bag and put it on the final tip of the wall , held it in place with the rocks the swimmer had gathered . The eastern sky was full of the setting sun 's yellow , and the mirror 's surface glowed like a lens , as if scooping up all the beautiful sunlight in the world and flinging it westward , in a single coherent beam . “
44016	44038	44013	44013	we	932	" Thel asked . The swimmer stretched and stood on her hind legs , pointing with one foreleg at the glass . "
