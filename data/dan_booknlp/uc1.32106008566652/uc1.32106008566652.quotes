914	1048	1266	1270	one 's friends ' sons	984	'm not sure I want even to be deputy leader this time . I only want to think about communication problems and what alterations may have taken place since we left . Sometimes I think of my life in terms of time : my own time and the very different times of other people . And sometimes I think of it in terms of moral problems . We Terrans have always had moral problems , or so the backtime - explorers tell us . Many other forms of conscious life have not been bothered that way . Yet there are some worlds which have had an even more complicated moral set - up than we have , especially when there is not one , but two or more , dominant species . Perhaps we 're
1269	3043	3547	3547	He	221	' sons . However , I know as well as the rest that one should n't let oneself be attracted , and at least all my children 's fathers were in my own age group or older . One ought to leave the young alone . How many times I 've said that to myselfl And usually , I will say , acted on it . Still , that 's the least of the problems , for it is strictly Terran , although naturally in other worlds with a comparable sociosexual organisation , the same thing arises . It just does n't happen on Mars , Vly tells me , and that makes sense . Far more of our today 's problems are connected with interference . Before the codifying or rules for space explorers , there were constant examples of deliberate interference with other life , almost always ending disastrously and making communication less easy for several generations . It is still one 's major temptation and that is why the penalty is irrevocable : to be returned to earth or whatever one 's planet may be and never , any more , to be an explorer . To be bound to time . And how often , still , the 16 penalty has to be employed . I have been near enough to it myself . Just as I have been very near to having the whole stability of my personality altered and shattered in an irreversible way . Naturally , the young are impatient . I know I was . The tides of curiosity are rising , and one becomes pressingly aware of all the galaxies . Even when one realises that it will take years to learn to communicate , one longs all the same to be off . It 's not for nothing that most of the workable short - cutting circuits , as well as almost all the unworkable ones , were discovered by the under - thirties . Some of them indeed have been the work of men and women who realised that their genetic make - up was such that communication would always be difficult . Knowledge of other sciences can be borrowed or shared , but communication is essential . And meanwhile there are the other worlds waiting . One reads and watches , one steeps oneself in 3D and 4D ; one practises detachment in the face of apparently disgusting and horrible events ; one practises taking bizarre points of view . And one is told about time blackout . It was my mother who told me . She was just back from a voyage , and I had suddenly realised that , although I had been growing up and feeling in every cell of my body the marvellous , beautiful sweep of the Terran seasons , the Arctic spring , the flickering lightning of the monsoons , the crash of the west Atlantic hurricanes , yet she seemed unchanged . As a child I had accepted this without bothering : there are stable older people in one 's life , and one 's own loved group , with whom one first experiments in sex play and verse and painting . For me and my friends , parents and grandparents came and went , though occasionally one would reach an age where he or she decided to give up exploration and settle back into time . Then , fairly soon , they would be dead . Or sometimes there might be parents who were not explorers , but mainly , for example , administrators , though they too might fairly often go long distances and experience time blackout . But not as a matter of course . They began to look old ; my mother never did . We are all able to love our parents . Our conflicts with older 17 a people do not involve them , because they just are n't there to be reacted against . We react quite enough against the Terran non - explorers , poor things ; not that they think of themselves in that light . And I realised , of course , that my mother had given me a year of her life , stabilising me , the customary slowmotion year which , to speak the complete truth , I have always enjoyed myself , even though it is a temporary surrender to time . There are moments , are n't there , when surrender is delicious , even to that old enemy . So my mother explained it all , and various things which I had read and not understood came into focus . Time blackout is not easy , after all , though we have such a slick little phrase for it . I always think that a mother should be the one to do the telling . It was the last time we were together . She never came back from her next voyage , and nobody could find out exactly what had happened to the ship . Perhaps they were all in blackout when whatever end it was came to them . Oddly enough , my father 's father was on the same voyage ; I believe he had intended it to be his last . But by the time I knew about it a good many Terran years had gone by . I was looking forward with intense excitement to my own first voyage . I suppose one of the things which one finds it hardest to take is that one must develop a stable personality and yet that inevitably it will be altered by the other forms of life with which one will be in communication , and that these biopsychical alterations must be accepted . And can only be accepted by the stable . And that the achievement of stability alone , even after what the mother has done in the first year , takes half an old - fashioned lifetime . For the nursery world , up to thirty or thirty - five , there is nowhere like Terra , lovely old Terra that we have nearly destroyed so often , and all its amiable fauna , within reach of normal affection . Above all , for the woman child . I may be out of date , but I always feel that biology and , of course , communication are essentially women 's work , and glory . Yes , I know there have been physicists like Yin Ih and molecular astronomers I remember old Jane Rakadsalis myself , her wonderful black , ageless face opening into a great smile ! But 18 somehow the disciplines of life seem more congenial to most of us women . It always seems to me curious that there are some things in exploration that we simply can not think will happen , in spite of all our warnings and examples . A failure of communication ? Or of imagination ? Does communication wipe out imagination , which is , in a sense , solitary ? My group is working just now with some quite young volunteers , and we may get results . The difficulty seems to be that in the nursery world we take ourselves for granted as stable personalities , as completely secure . Impossible that we should ever deviate , that interference should ever be a temptation . Not for us , we think . How young can one be ! And this in spite of books , films , contacts of all kinds . It is of course simply that one has to be over - stable in order to stand up to later impacts , and the fact of this over - stability makes one unable to guard against what will certainly happen , as one might have guarded had one felt oneself in any way weak . It all works out in the end . But the impact of other worlds on this apparently immovable stability comes as a surprise . Nobody enjoys their first personality changes . Most of us have at some time tried out some of the hallucinogens which do produce temporary change , but somehow that does not prepare one as much as is supposed . Not at least in my experience . Occasionally , even , in an attempt to rock personality , young people try the experiment of becoming temporary carnivores . I never did that myself , but then , I am greedy , very much aware of the taste and texture of what I eat . Besides , I think a communications girl would be bound to find it impossible ; there is no edible life in Terra which can not evoke some slight empathy for any of us . Although , of course , I longed in the normal human way for exploration , I found my first world oddly disconcerting . I remember it so well ! Naturally they do n't start one on completely unknown or very dangerous loci and luckily too there is an infinite or is it infinite ? Oh well , that 's not for me to say - choice . I was thought to be good at communication ( I am , of course , or you would not be understanding this page 19 which you are reading ) so I was teamed up with other experts , all youngish , except for our leader , Peder Pedersen , the mathematician . How lucky I was to start with him . How very lucky . There is something fascinating about the detail of one 's first space journey . They get terribly boring after a time , and perhaps that 's as well or one would have less opportunity for contemplation which , after all , needs conditions of slight discomfort . Normally nowadays I contemplate during the whole of the space flight , whether in or out of time , but in those days I had not yet mastered any of the usual techniques of contemplation , nor would it have been normal at that age . The world was lambda 771 in the Q series . Got there ? Not an impossible atmosphere , and a comparatively minor gravitation problem . But communication had not been established . The difficulty was not in any kind of hostile attitude . That kind of thing has been almost entirely overcome , except in those few galaxies about which we all know . But in lambda 771 the inhabitants '

3603	3679	3698	3698	you	0	' he said , and out of the corner of my eye I could see him coming nearer . And at the same time I did feel a little scared . Only a little , of course ; I was passed as completely stable , and I was well aware that I would not have been taken on this expedition if it had been supposed that it was a dangerous assignment instead of merely tricky . '

3702	3703	3700	3700	Mary	96	' ‘
3709	4189	3698	3698	you	0	' I said . He began to try and help me with circuits , but I asked him not to ; it is a thing one has to do , after all , oneself . But I liked in that he had tried , and that it had brought his head so close to 9 21 my hand that I only had to stretch my fingers - and there it was , the delightful heather spring of the different hair tension tingling against one 's digital nerves as no flaccid blond hair does . He did not move his head away . 22 2 It was quite a problem to get through to those radial entities . Naturally I spent some time in the most unobtrusive observing while I thought out the best communication techniques to use . Their main organs were , of course , central and not orientated in any direction . I soon became sure that any unevenness in the peripheral ring of brain - plus - eye material was looked upon as a blemish , but one was left in uncertainty as to whether this was supposed to be moral or physical . They also wore at times a kind of flimsy artificial covering which could either protect the ring or make it more obvious , and which appeared to be kept below the body , or possibly to be exuded from the under part . It clung to one 's fingers if one touched it , and had a smell which was entirely new to me and difficult to assess . It was extremely hard to know what kind of thing this was without interference . And I was being very very careful about that , all the more as it was my first world . After a time , however , I realised that I must concentrate on what went on during periods of a rather strange activity in which first of all one radiate would move under a shelter and start to turn , first in direction , then in another ; apparently the direction in which they began occurred entirely at random , or at any rate we never found any evidence to the contrary . I am almost certain that this was a kind of reversion towards 23 spirality . In our world , species which spiral do so in one direction only , but I do not think this would have been the case with the ancestors of my radiates . I found a small shell - producing form of life in this world , and was interested to see that its spiral went either way . At any rate , the dance would begin with one individual . Then another would become aware of this and approach . The two would lock together like cog - wheels , an '
4191	4291	3700	3700	Mary	96	' into a hollow . Then , usually quite rapidly , others would appear so that in a matter of half an hour there would be a dense carpet of them , the inner ones locked together , the outer ones apparently in some agitation attempting to get inward , especially if there were so many that the shelter could not cover them . Had these creatures been descended from six - armed ancestors , the putting together would have been easier ; as it was there were always gaps in the perfection of the carpet , even if the ‘
4293	5468	6800	6800	You	225	' were retracted , expanded or otherwise adjusted . And it seeemed though the object was for all to come close and quiet and untroubled . When this was achieved for a moment , the membranes covering the eyes , which were deep bluish green in contrast to the general brownish yellow of the body colour , shut down and the brain ring with its marked nodules at the central arm nerves appeared to flatten . We had some knowledge of the anatomy of these creatures owing to the fact that we occasionally saw one that had been killed by a type of insectoid enemy , not unlike mosquitoes , but up to thirty centimetres long , with extremely hard sucking jaws , which dropped on to the radiates from above . These were what we called jags . They appeared to be so nearly without consciousness of any kind that we were prepared to count them provisionally as not - life . Of course , one can communicate with all forms of life , however destructive and without consciousness ; but that time has not come . Meanwhile it had enabled us on this world to do a dissection and preservation of one of the inhabitants . We could only hope that we had not interfered with any death or burial rites . It was against these jags , we thought , that our radiates built their decorated shelters . Meanwhile , the jags dropped jaws first on to the eye ring , killing in a matter of minutes . None of them 24 had actually attacked one of us , but there was always the possibility . Several times they had plummeted on to pieces of apparatus which had some glistening parts which might have appeared to them as eyes . We were taking no risks . Once I had settled down with the radiates , I tried out various means of communication until at last I got my contact . It took me a long time , I remember . Nowadays I would probably have managed it all much quicker and with more certain jumps towards the solution of my problem , but after all this was my first world . There were days when I felt completely baffled , but I just could not go back and say to T'o M'Kasi , or indeed to any of the others , that I had been unable to get through . I did meanwhile make a number of observations which supplemented those which other members of the expedition were making . I had decided that I had better , as far as possible , go around on hands and knees so as to be at the same aesthetic level as the rest of the inhabitants . Had I not done so , I would probably not have realised the nature of some of the movable artefacts . In fact , I could not always make out what , if anything , they were used for , but could admire them . was looking at a rounded object in some material which I did not recognise , but which had decorations inside it , of much the same kind which from time to time in human aesthetic history workers in glass have been proud to produce . It was apparently something which was rolled round the eye ring by a muscular ripple . I could not see that it was in any way what one might call useful . And suddenly my aesthetic admiration appeared to meet an echo . I realised I had got through . As usual in communication problems , the first step was the most difficult . Once one saw what kind of rapport should be looked for , it was a matter of rapid assemblement of data . I had , after all , had the training . At one stage in my solution or rather our joint solution , for the radiates were as eager from their side as I was from mine - I had a piece of luck . I saw one of the jags hurtling down and managed to kill it in flight . Oddly enough , I had never killed anything before . Terra , after all , is clear of enemies . I knew the jags counted as not - life , but all the same I was shocked at my own action . Not so the radiates . 25 Well , I wo n't bore you with my observations . The final findings of the expedition are all naturally in the Journal . I remember I made a most ludicrous mistake about their sex life ! This was corrected in a later edition ; it was all due to my own anthropomorphising . I had been warned about it often enough , but one never knows quite how these things will take one . Doubtless my subconscious drive was firmly fastened on myself and T'o . However , my conscious concentration was all on the radiates . Gradually over a period of weeks I developed communication , first from generalised approval or disapproval and the simple harmonics to more complex and precise and mental aesthetic or mathematical statements . Then gradually we got on , once they themselves were co - operating completely , to further developments . I had , of course , like a dancer to adapt myself to my communicators . That 's the kind of reason why , as I 've said , I believe communication science is so essentially womanly . It fits one 's basic sex patterns . And the more I adapted to them , the more out of tune I became with my own normal concepts . Turning over on my mattress – I had one of those rather special ones then that fold into nothing and foam at a touch of any atmosphere ; nowadays I meditate and do n't need one even that simple choice involving right or left seemed unnatural . Right hand or left - impossible alternations ! In communication , as , of course , you realise , by the constant succession of a or b , a or b choices , snap judgements and actions can be made as rapidly as possible in the semi - intuitive technique we have all learned , which is both mental and manual since it also involves instruments . I found these choice successions increasingly difficult to make . It was like walking in loose sand , a drag of other concepts . One is so used to a two - sided brain , two eyes , two ears , and so on that one takes the whole thing and all that stems from it for granted . Incorrectly , but inevitably . My radiates had an entirely different outlook . As I got to know them better , I realised that in many ways they were highly - in our phrase '
5470	6799	6818	6818	I	0	' . But they never thought in terms of either - or . It 26 - oegan to seem to me very peculiar that I should do so myself , and that so many of my judgements were paired ; good and evil , black or white , to be or not to be . Even while one admitted that moral and intellectual judgements were shifting and temporary , they had still seemed to exist . Above all , judgements of scientific precision . But after a certain amount of communication with the radiates all this smudged out . If alternative means , not one of two , but one , two , three or four out of five , then action is complicated and slowed to the kind of tempo and complexity which is appropriate to an organism with many hundreds of what were in evolutionary time fairly simple suckers and graspers , but which in development have adapted themselves for locomotion , food retention , tool - handling , the finer delicacies of touch and probably for other purposes of which I only became partly aware . It thus came about that with no sense of awkwardness , two or more choices could be made more or less conflicting though never opposite . Gradually I found myself getting into the same state of mind . As I got to know my radiates as individuals – always a little difficult with a completely other species and one tends to memorise individuality by inessential markings and deformations and such – the thing got more difficult . They did not name themselves as we Terrans do , and as we are apt to imagine most other worlds do . There were , however , group names shading into one another . Slowly I began to forget my own name . It is obvious that their mathematics would be different , though I found it extremely hard to grasp at first . It seemed to be exactly what was needed for their technological purposes , and technology they had , once one became aware of what objects were natural and what altered in this particular world . The queer thing was that to my mind they were extraordinarily inefficient about the jags . Probably this was something to do with their sight ; they did not , of course , focus through holes in rings of contracting muscles as we do . They perceived not two , but a great number of images of a much more diffuse kind , which built up into the sort of perception which one could guess at through their art . Naturally the vision was of the same quality all round , so that there was no front or back , but it - 27 appeared as though they were unable to see anything at a great distance above them – distance in which the jags flew and from which they plummeted . So the jags seemed to appear out of nowhere for no reason suddenly and inescapably . I felt if I could only get them to try ! But that would have been interference . They did make the decorated shelters , and so long as they stayed underneath them they were safe , but not when they went outside . Yet inside and outside was too sharp and opposite a distinction to be clear to them . Nor after a while was it any longer clear to me . For I was coming more and more into tune with the five - choiced world . Naturally I did not realise it was affecting my own personality . I felt only that everything was going as it should be , was opening out , that I was appreciating more and more the thought and actions of my chosen world . When their wheeling dances started , I found myself emotionally wheeling with them , even if in fact I stayed still , or almost still ; I felt myself merging in an all - sided relationship , not merely eye to eye . On a further remove problems appeared to be solving themselves , though sometimes uncertainties remained which all the same did not seem to be relevant . It is not easy to recall all this , because the actual words in which it is recalled are too sharp and unambiguous , plain uncompromising Terran words , often with exact opposites ! I also found that I was beginning to think of general philosophical problems in a way that seemed new and full of possibilities . And yet somehow I could not quite apply my mind directly to them in the way I had done in my Terran days . I would find myself in the evenings after work with an idea , or indeed with several ideas ; these appeared to be graspable , to throw new lights on some kind of reality . Yet something , as it were , slipped . And then I found an equal slipping in my imaginations about To M'Kasi . I had supposed myself to have made up my mind about him . But who was I ? What my mind ? I began to get the feeling that what was happening to me was on a par with what happens under the action of some of the hallucinogens , when the nature 28 of perception is taken apart so that several aspects of the object normally seen as one are now seen separate . I remembered with some slight uneasiness that it took some time for the personality to reintegrate after some of these drug experiences , and I began to think I must go back to the rest of the Expedition . Go back ? Back ? It did n't have any meaning . Or did it ? Well , I got together my apparatus , my notes and my shelter with some fumblings , and then I got in touch with the others . I had sent messages from time to time to our base , as we all did while we were working on our own , but I had taken less and less interest in doing so and in what they said in return . Any of them . Then something happened . I was wearing my shieldings but had lifted the eye mask ; it was a pattern we had in those days which was apt to dim . I looked up and around slowly , I suppose in a way imitating the radiates , and was suddenly aware of a jag high up but coming straight at my eyes . And for a moment I was completely unable to save myself ; the simple courses open to me : to snap down my eye piece , to duck my head so that the shieldings covered me , to raise my hand , to shut my eyes all seemed so equivalent that I could do none of them . Luckily I reasserted my normal self , snapped out of it with a couple of seconds clearance , enough to duck forward so that the jag splintered itself messily on my shieldings . But I felt a good deal shaken . Looking down at the smashed - up jag , it appeared to me that my action had been random and unreasonable . Surely there should have been something else ? T'o M'Kasi came out to meet me . He seemed different . Or did he ? Was it in him or in me , this difference ? I could n't even decide on what the difference was if it existed . It was as though I was in some curious way elsewhere . As though he spoke to me from behind something . I could n't place it . Then he said something that rang a bell . ‘

8744	8776	8777	8777	You	277	' killing and eating habits were distasteful . Yet this was nothing very new . I remember Peder Pedersen glancing at a picture and saying to me , with a grin : '
8787	9438	9501	9501	she	280	' This was quite a difficult exercise , but of course necessary before communication could be properly established , and I was on my toes to do better than the last expedition . Thinking oneself into the shape of one 's contact was elementary when considering communication techniques , but sometimes one had to be very careful to think oneself back . The last expedition had intended to go to this planet , but had in fact spent all its time in the original Epsilon world , where there was so much information to be passed . Peder just hinted to me that membership of this last expedition had been , well , almost over non - biological . One does n't want to criticise another discipline ; but one knows what molecular chemists are like . And the Epsies had plenty for them . Their atmosphere produced some very peculiar complexes , which left our dull old carbons in the stone age . I ca n't find this very enjoyable myself , but to some people it 's jam . Well , it was the usual thing taking off . The gadgets , the excite ment , the blotting out of time . And then this world , lovely , except as I said for the atmosphere and to some extent the gravity . I had already decided what type of communication block I must overcome , and was quite excited at the prospect . The Epsies had been warned of our coming , and had an area ready for us . They had even put up structures in which we could have our own atmosphere – rather ingenious really , with interpenetrating passages for their own atmosphere and ours , so that they could come into our house and communicate through a system of cleverly devised locks – if one could call them that . We all expressed our thanks and satisfaction , but the building material was transparent throughout , and I confess it gave me - 35 - a very curious feeling to have the Epsies flatly slithering at the far side of a transparency . This was all the more marked since they had not been quite able to imagine the non - flatness of humans , and most of the rooms were a tight fit sideways . There were only one or two places where we could pass one another at all comfortably . It was specially awkward for Peder Pedersen , who by now had developed a certain Scandinavian type solidity . But the lack of basic privacy was unpleasant , and when that was complicated by the presence of very slight leakage at one or two of the communication locks – we soon found out which – with resultant hallucinations , most of us began to react badly . Naturally one could retire to the old ship for a rest ; when Peder Pedersen 's language had relaxed completely into archaic Norwegian swearwords ( curious that they remained theological rather than sexual for so long , I developed quite a theory about that ) the rest of us always got him to go back . I remember asking one of them how old they thought he was . He seemed at the time quite immeasurably older . Odd that I should have thought that . But I did n't go back to the ship much myself ; I felt I had to make the most of my time . Silis Grasni , who was on the original Epsilon expedition , but whom I met for the first time after I came back – she was over in Mars for a conference and , I expect , for the wines , most of the months of preparation before we left told me that the colonist Epsies were probably rather different from the originals . '
9458	9498	9513	9513	I	0	' said Silis . “ The old Epsies would have used a bit more tact , though it would have come to much the same thing . Still it was a different species they used in the home world . '
9517	10227	10424	10424	You	281	' By that time I knew what she meant . Well , one has to make allowances for the colonist mentality . We know enough about it from our own history , but it was the first time I had met it in real life , and I had no other Epsie social standards by which to judge those in this colonised planet . The chemists of the other expedition had been singularly uninterested in biological standards . During the first period I had only communicated with the a 36 Epsies who came into our dwelling . We did disentangle some of our problems , and I was able to ask questions in different scientific and philosophical disciplines from those that had been used before . All this was interesting and satisfactory , but soon I began to ask myself what other biological entities might be contacted on this planet . Our botanist , who was enjoying himself in the blue groves , thought there were distinct possibilities . And that way I began to become aware of the round - headed , dark - eyed fauna . My play approach met with an immediate response , and I soon found that they made shelters , decorated themselves with fringed , blue leaves , and a kind of shining nut - like growth , and plucked their sparse silky fur into patterns . And then I found that part of their play activity was something which I could only think of as singing and dancing . Indeed , so much in sympathy did I become that I found this beautiful and moving , to the extent that at first I suspected it might be partly hallucinatory until every test I could devise showed that it was not . Their main characteristic I suppose was liveliness . It is not altogether easy to say what one means by that . As they moved quickly , slipping in and out of the blue groves , bouncing rhythmically over fallen vegetation , handling and tossing with their fingerlike , rapidly moving front or hind paws , above all dancing , they seemed to give off a brightness which might have had something to do with the circulation of a blood - like substance , about which later we were to find out far too much , under their semi - transparent skin and light fur . They quarrelled , slapping at one another , or displayed and chased in a pleasing sexual activity . As soon as I came into contact with them I was never tired of watching them and joining with them in so far as the clumsiness of my atmosphere suit and the gravity pressure allowed . They used to gaze at my eyes , and dab at them quickly with paws or lips , but the window kept them out . I felt how much I would enjoy a still closer contact . Naturally I tried to communicate . I did not hide this , and I also began to question the Epsies . It became apparent that there was some close relationship between the Epsies and these others . At last I found one of the Epsies who obviously knew all about a 37 it . We always found it difficult to tell them apart ; that 's always so , of course , with some species towards which one can have no emotional feeling . Perhaps if one had allowed oneself to hate the Epsies , one could have told them apart . But hate is something of which no explorer should ever be guilty . Anyhow , this one was larger than the rest , and highly decorated ; his feet were all inlaid with various metals which gave a very striking effect while they rippled . Our communication was , of course , not in sounds , and they were uninterested in proper names ( assuming even that they had them ) . Among ourselves we called this one Glitterboy . He seemed to enjoy particularly being asked questions about the other fauna . They seemed to have a name for them allied to the concept of a sphere or circle ; I translated it '

He let us know that if we wanted to find out more about the Rounds , we should come with him at a time he would indicate . Peder was much interested , and said he would come too . The rest were all involved with their own problems . My next attempt was to communicate with the Rounds with regard to the Epsies . This was the more difficult , because I had no notion of how much aware they were of the other species . I started by showing them pictures , up to life - size , but they had no idea how to perceive or organise the information from pictures . Then I got one of the others to help me make some 3D flimsies , which , after a lot of frustration behaviour , they did finally recognise . The reaction then was one of anger . They beat at the flimsies and tore them and a few ran away . I began to wonder what I was likely to see . '
10432	10437	10424	10424	You	281	' said Peder Pedersen . '
10442	10458	10478	10478	he	282	' I answered automatically , for it is drummed into one so thoroughly . And then '
10468	10477	10478	10478	he	282	're getting to like the Rounds , Mary , '
10492	10531	10478	10478	he	282	' He nodded towards the utterly separate but so very intimate passage within inches of our cheeks and hands . There was an Epsie at the far end , clearly , I thought , longing to be questioned . '
10543	10548	10909	10909	Mary	96	' he went on , '
10577	10908	10909	10909	Mary	96	' I remember that as I backed out - for of course the room was too narrow for anything else - I began to have considerable misgivings about what was going to happen . However , it was a few days before we got the indication from Glitterboy . Meanwhile I did a good deal of outside exploring . Besides the Rounds , there were various rather odd - shaped fauna , ranging from a jelly - like thing that oozed about among the blue groves , to a gregarious type rather like frogs on stilts , small flying forms , reddish crawlers which my Rounds used to pull up by their tails , although they did not eat them , and a large nocturnal animal which I never managed to see clearly . We experimented gingerly with the vegetation , eating very small quantities . But to us it was all completely inedible ; that 's one of the disappointments of a new world , at any rate for young explorers : so often one finds something which gives one the feeling that it must be a still more delicious plum or peach , but how rarely it is ! The time came . Glitterboy indicated that we should go with him . I was glad of old Peder plodding beside me in his atmosphere suit , feeling the gravity which gave him various kinds of aches and pains , which he never spoke about as such , but which were clearly what he often swore at . There was no conveyance on this planet ; it was not something which the Epsies had put their minds to , possibly because so much sensation , and perhaps emotion , was located in their feet . I doubt if they became tired in any way which would mean anything to humans . Even I got rather tired , young as I was then . I remember Peder saying to me , '
10919	11142	11146	11146	you	286	' I thought at the time that he 'd said it to give himself an excuse , so I duly sat down with him beside me . But now I am sure he was really watching me , and really felt I was tired . He was used to his own aches . But Glitterboy poured himself over rock and gravel , under the fronds of the waving blue trees or their fallen trunks . When moving , the front third of their body , which was erect during questioning , went back on to the ground and went into action . 39 His feet made a scuttering rattling noise . What seemed odd to me was that there were no Rounds to be seen , though I noticed plenty of the jelly lumps and stilted frogs . Before we left I had asked Peder if we should take weapons . All expeditions carry these for defensive use in utmost emergencies . And of course to destroy oneself or one 's friends comparatively painlessly in certain eventualities – though only too often if these occur one has not got the weapon . I knew how in theory they were used , but absolutely not in practice . Peder smiled and said he would take what was needed . I had better not . '
11155	11159	11146	11146	you	286	' he said , '
11162	11444	11146	11146	you	286	' We now came to one of their buildings , a sheer wall of some glassy substance , a chemical combination which the atmosphere made possible . Glitterboy began communicating , telling us that now we should see the use of the Rounds . Suddenly I noticed that his mouth parts were moving very unpleasantly or unpleasantly to me . I remembered being told earlier on , when watching the film , to get behind that mouth . I could n't do it now , but I tried to show nothing . As always in the Epsie structures , the door was hinged at the top ; Peder and I had to bend . We straightened ourselves in a high and narrow courtyard whose walls had a few very steep , very narrow staircases sloping up them , apparently to reach a parapet which ran along the top . And the courtyard was packed with Rounds , and they were in a really terrible state of agitation , fear and anxiety and violence . Some were running and leaping , others seemed to have frozen into unnatural postures . Some sang , but not the songs which had gone with the dances or the sexual play . And I could see that Peder could not recognise it as singing , though I , having been with them more , certainly did . The whole thing began to remind me of something I could not place . And then I did . It was a set of photographs which I had seen during my social history course . These were of what used to be called inmates of a mental hospital , a '
11446	11636	11146	11146	you	286	' as they said in those days , into which violently agitated people could be shovelled out of sight . What I saw had been a combination picture made up from these photo- 40 graphs , and it was exactly how the poor Rounds looked , except that they had this glow which I had noticed before , during periods of action , coming off them . Glitterboy erected his front third and began to communicate so fast that I could n't pick it up . Some seemed to be organic chemistry formulae , and from my subsequent interpretation I suppose this was about the blood , or blood - like liquor , which was circulating so rapidly and invitingly to him inside the Rounds ; and also about the chemical needs of his own body , of which he was accurately aware . But there was something about the tone of the whole communication which was startlingly repulsive . Yes , and dangerous . Dangerous even to ourselves . I looked at Peder . Through the window of his suit he gave me a look which said question . '
11640	12775	12828	12828	I	0	' I began , and again Glitterboy poured out more information than I could channel , and suddenly he made a rush at the Rounds . So did several other Epsies who had been quiescent close to the walls . A door hinged up at the far end , and the Rounds began pouring through in a panic that translated itself to me as No , No , Nol But Glitterboy had rippled up one of the staircases and on to the parapet . I thought we had better follow , since I did not at all like the idea of going through the gate with the Rounds . The stairs were difficult , too steep for the gravity , too narrow for something without a handrail on the drop side . It was worse for Peder , who positively bulged over the drop . Nor was the parapet at the top any too wide . But perhaps it was as well that our own slight peril did take our minds off what was happening below . For Glitterboy now seemed to be holding some kind of metal instrument , as unfamiliar in shape as the rest of their tools . Then I saw what it was for . As the Rounds passed under the door with their heads down , he or another put this or a similar instrument over their heads and pressed it . As this was done , each of the Rounds gave a little thin high yelp , only just audible through the hearing locks in our atmosphere suits . But then they ran on . They ran through a still narrower passage and into another courtyard . And then they seemed to settle down . 41 Yes , that was definite . They were wandering about , not jumping or yelling or singing or expressing any violent emotion , and apparently in no pain . We walked carefully along the parapet until we were above them . I noticed then the peculiar shine or glow of activity had died out of them . What had happened ? I then noticed that a few of them were being herded , gently and without trouble , into a still further enclosure between high walls . Glitterboy scuttled rapidly in that direction , and dived down the wall . We looked at one another , and Peder shook his head slightly . We went on watching the Rounds . In so far as I could pick up what they were communicating , it was assent . Some of them had settled in sitting or lying positions . When one of the Epsies came up to them , they did not seem perturbed , though even the flimsies had thrown them into such rage and terror before . But inside the further enclosure ? Suddenly Glitterboy came slithering up out of it . There was something dreadful dripping from his mouth parts . Silis told me afterwards that in their home world the Epsies did not drip . But Glitterboy was a colonist . He stiffened , raising his much inlaid feet in the pleasurable attitude of one being questioned . I asked him quickly what he had been doing , and he answered , as I had expected he would , in biochemical terms of absorption but with a certain excitement . He indicated that we should see - and perhaps even share in the process . It was , of course , essential that , as members of an expedition , we should observe and , as far as possible , participate , but the Epsies had realised that their substances were inedible to Terrans . It was only an outburst of enthusiasm that had made Glitterboy offer us the treat . We did , however , observe , take notes and question . It was as we had supposed . The Rounds in the enclosure were set upon and sucked by the Epsies . They seemed to contain from seven to eight litres of bloodlike liquor , more for their size and weight than humans . The dry bodies for the sucking process was thorough - were processed and used as building material . They did not seem to object very much to what was . 42 happening , though most of them winced at the initial puncture . Certainly they were not afraid . When Peder communicated a question about the circulation of this blood - like liquor , Glitterboy and another Epsie obligingly ripped open the body of a living Round . The circulatory organ was unexpectedly high up , but then there was no lung structure comparable with that of mammals . The most familiar anatomical feature was the brain in the head , though under a skull that was membranous rather than bony . That made it easier for the Epsies to give it that little nick which turned the fighting rebellious Rounds into docile and unanxious entities , and which also slowed the circulation , thus making ingestion somewhat easier and less messy . If that mattered . Even the Round whose internal structures were exposed for our interest did not seem to be in even minor agony or fear . Discomfort , yes . But that disappeared in dying . Leaving the agony with me . Peder Pedersen and I pieced together the rest of the story . Not all the Round population was taken , but enough to last for some time . The rest , breeding , would fill their place . There had been a time when they had been corralled , but the brain had not been nicked . Then there had been scenes . I got the nasty feeling that Glitterboy at least regretted them . Now it was almost too easy and unquestioning . Yes , in the old days the Rounds had occasionally turned on their Epsie captors , jumped over them , scratched with their paws at vulnerable eyes and brain spots , and quite often escaped – not all , but some of them . That no longer happened . All thought that the lifted gate was a way out ; they could see some way beyond it their companions moving peaceably about . It was so arranged that they did not see the metal instruments . I began to feel so full of hate for the Epsies that I could barely communicate . They realised that there was some failure , but did not know what . Peder Pedersen knew , all the same . He said to me through our radio link , ich I remember distorted voices so that his sounded several tones lower than in real life and slightly crackling , '
12784	12827	12828	12828	I	0	' I knew . I knew . And yet I could not bear it . I felt 43 9 myself gasping . I knew that if I had been the one with the weapon I would have had my hand on it . '
12834	12839	13211	13211	You	288	' said Peder Pedersen , '
12843	13210	13211	13211	You	288	' I looked down at the Rounds and Epsies , and felt myself rocking slightly on the edge of the parapet , recovered , but with a jerk that strained my atmosphere suit . In the mild leak that followed I hallucinated an extraordinary series of religious episodes . Naturally one learns the whole strange history during one 's adolescence , and often re - lives some earlier religious experience . I had as a girl been more attracted by some of the early twenty - first century developments of Islam . But these hallucinations were wholly Christian , including a crucifixion in which the protagonist was ripped up and bled and bled endlessly . I remember pointing out to someone or something that the heart was in the human position , but could easily and somehow be shifted to become the Roundian circulatory organ . All sorts of entities which I had seen in books and films came to lap up the flowing blood , and at last the Epsies . As is so often the case in hallucinations , the whole thing appeared to take in a vast stretch of time , although on the clock of pulse and respiration rate it took only seconds . But I was aware in some corner of remembrance that the overt practice of Terran religion in another world counted as interference ; it was a very old decision not of much interest now , since few expeditions included persons genuinely interested in such things . Yet it appeared to me that the only way to achieve my end was to mount the cross myself and to bleed , explaining in a loud voice that I had not been nicked , that I was fully aware , and that this blood was freely and for ever available instead of the blood of the Rounds . I struggled to communicate this to all the different worlds , at the same time commiserating with myself that I was irrevocably fastened to a piece of heavy wood and so could never any more be an explorer . But then I felt hands on me , Terran hands , and a voice saying '
13218	14592	15152	15152	I	0	' and the faint crackling of Peder 's voice . Down – how could I get down off the cross ? But somehow I had to . Then the hallucinations began to fade out , and I saw that Peder was tightening the strained joints of my a 44 atmosphere suit and was pushing me towards the steps – there was another set , equally steep , equally narrow , on the outer side of the wall . I climbed down somehow with a post - hallucinatory headache beginning to bang at the base of my skull . Inside the walls it was still going on , the full horror . On the way back , Peder Pedersen began over the crackling link to tell me about his childhood in a still fairly remote part of Terra , of the snow melting and the birches beginning to leaf , of the berry - picking children and the midnight sun , of the northern lights which were so wonderful before one 's eyes were set on the galaxies and far stranger sights , and will be wonderful again when one is old and decides to retire for ever to the kind breast of Terra . Somehow it took me back to my right mind . I rested for an hour or two in the ship , out of sight of the Epsies , till the headache and the hate had worn off . Yet in a sense the hallucination held me . Could I have done anything , somehow , along those lines ? I could not see how . I can not yet see how . And yet even now I feel that I ought to be able to see . But at the time all that I felt was deep shame . I was utterly humiliated because I had been so helpless . Somehow I had failed , perhaps betrayed , those whom I thought of as my friends . This feeling went on during the whole duration of the expedition , nor had the fact that I managed to break through some of the communication barriers which had baffled my predecessors to the Epsie world helped to lift me up . It was only during the slowdown at the end of the flight , with thoughts of Terra imminent , that I talked about it to Peder Pedersen . I remember he said to me that humilation , however it was produced , was a necessary stage in exploration . The confident and equable could never be the greatest explorers . It was difficult to understand at the time , though I think I understand now . He said that one must be ready to be taken in , even if that meant being laughed at afterwards , because there must be no barriers between oneself and other entities . Disbelief must always be suspended . Humiliation . Out of the very bottom , when the moral and intellectual self one so carefully builds up has been pulled down , when there is nothing between one and the un- 45 caring trampling foot of reality , then one may at last and genuinely observe and know . And the process of humiliation , Peder said , must happen again and again . That is n't how one used , as a young person , to imagine the great explorers . But I am inclined to think that there is something in it . 46 4 At first the feeling of failure and humiliation was only painful . I could not face the preparation for another expedition , and yet I knew the moral problem of the Epsies and Rounds was a fairly simple one , which had , in fact , been met in some form by several expeditions . If only T'o had been there . He could have picked me out of my pain , and we could have been happy on Terra . But that did n't work out ; our subjective years did n't seem to synchronise . I could n't even write up my observations properly . Peder Pedersen was extraordinarily sympathetic , but busy on another expedition . He asked me to come , but I did n't . I could n't . I became mildly interested in certain aspects of immunology , and hung around with the immunologists at one of their centres . Then something turned up which flipped on the current . As you know , alien tissues call up antibodies from the living mammalian body . But take a tissue so alien that it is not recognised even as an enemy so that no antibody is produced . And suppose again that it is also of a kind which can symbiose with a mammalian host and develop ? This was for long purely a theoretical supposition . Then suddenly it became possible . The type of life in a small and isolated world had exactly these requirements , and some specimens had been brought back ; everyone had agreed that they were too far from intelligence a 47 to make this morally questionable . The beings there regenerated entirely from quite small parts , much as we have all observed with the common earthworm . If kept in a suitable environment , they developed into the whole animal , but on a very small scale and barely viable , though it was possible to feed and cosset them into something like adulthood . But if they were grafted on to a host , they not only survived but became of a normal size , almost a metre in length . After that a neck formed between them and their host and normally they detached themselves . They appeared at first sight to be somewhat shapeless , if anything faintly repulsive . One got the feeling that they were at the evolutionary stage where they might develop in one of many possible directions , but this was , as it were , undecided . The behaviour of the grafts made this idea seem more plausible . It would have been inaccurate to speak in terms of intelligence , but certainly there was an organisation of behaviour and sensibility which gave a definite character to these beings . It was entirely meaningful to talk of pleasure and pain , of memory , anxiety and possibly affection in relation to them . They had no bone structure , but a certain degree of what looked like cartilagenous stiffening . They were not unpleasant to touch , with an outer layer , normally fairly soft , which could be hardened , apparently at will . They could also , again apparently at will , extrude pseudopodia , usually three or five , which helped them to writhe along , and might well be useful for other undefined purposes . They could ingest food , though in laboratory conditions it had to be thoroughly macerated . They could perceive certain kinds of near - by objects , at any rate , though it was not certain how . Some types of object or stimulus seemed to induce activity ; they could writhe and roll quickly towards or away from something they had perceived . But what kind of perception was it ? There appeared to be no differentiated organs ; it was , in some way , an overall effect , quite unlike anything Terran , or indeed most extraterrestrial life . The whole thing was baffling , and I came on it first in my communications role . I was equally baffled , but most interested . The grafts had been done in the first instance on various experimental animals , dogs , pigs , jackals , horses , the amiable 48 a Martian znydgi , and a few other species . The results had been unforeseen . Behaviour was , apparently , picked up to some extent at least from the host , for instance it was plain with the grafts on dogs . All the dogs in this centre liked the laboratory technicians , and one of them in particular who was the dogs ’

As soon as we got properly into friendly relations with one another , which happened fairly early on , long before we started galaxy - trotting , they began preaching at us about it . The earlier explorers had their trousers pulled off , and were asked very sympathetically if they were n't happier that way . '

Not that the long striped pods are anything like grapes , but the result is deliciously similar ! So when he named himself and , with an effort , called me Mary , I felt that a barrier had been overcome . So when I began to become fully conscious in the shipwe had taken off by this time - I was glad to have Vly there communicating . I wanted him all the time at first . If he left me to deal with navigation problems ( various things on the ship were broken , and take - off had been very difficult ) I became unhappy and restless . If I slept I would wake up whimpering for him . After a time I noticed that I was half undressed ; the atmosphere suit had been cut away from my broken arm , the broken bone in my foot , and from the whole of my body which was coming up in bruises . It hurt me a little when Vly communicated , lightweight though he was , but I would sooner have had him there than nobody . I was not fully myself , and needed contact . I am sure it would have helped Olga if something of the same kind could have been done with her , but she had only practised communication with them on the botanical level . Nor would she have liked to be undressed . The Martians , of course , found it best to try to get into contact with those areas in the human body which had most tactile sensations . Normally they respected our taboos , but not in an emergency such as this . Earlier on , before the disaster , I was the only one who was completely at ease in communication , though there was a certain general pick - up between human and Martian in more general terms and in mathematical symbols , which came across easily , at any rate between mathematicians on either side . Von 61 Braun himself was always rather bad at it . Some of the Martians obviously disliked communicating even with me . But with Vly , the fact that normally Martians find Terrans rather repulsive was overlaid by pure scientific curiosity and the delicate empathy towards a fellow worker which I mentioned earlier . Gradually , as the days went by , I began to be able to breathe and hear and move again , though with some pain and difficulty . I began to realise what had happened : the destruction of my friends and fellow workers and the loss of our data . But it was in an atmosphere of reassurance by the Martians . They were as shocked and unhappy as the rest of us about the disaster to the expedition , and as anxious to learn from it as we were , but the actual death of the Terrans did not have the same emotional impact . Olga recovered rather sooner than I did . She was with Zeke when he died of his multiple injuries , but the Martians at least managed to communicate some confidence and reassurance to him , which she thought made it easier . We put his body in the deep freeze ; there might be something to learn from it . Neither of us was a physiologist . And we all knew the horrid tendency of any large object pushed out through the locks to go into orbit . Whenever Olga made her way over to me , slowly because of a badly bruised back , she always covered me up . I said , '
20548	20549	20555	20555	myself	0	' '
20557	20566	20555	20555	myself	0	' she said . “ Yes , but you 're

20647	20658	20661	20661	I	0	' Is Vly male or female or both just now ? '
20664	20688	20758	20758	We	426	' Must be both . Unless the shock of all this brought on mono - sexual characteristics , but I have n't noticed . '
20763	21040	20758	20758	We	426	' natural catastrophe , but we were uncertain what had induced it : whether what had happened was within the powers of the fauna which we had observed and tried to communicate with , or whether we had just failed to realise the existence of some completely other life form , possibly not in that actual world , but probably in the same system . Gradually the Martians and ourselves came to the conclusion that the answer must be somewhere along these lines , and only to be solved by further expeditions . We turned over possibilities of this , looking for and finding precedents , while emotionally the Martians and Olga and I felt ourselves in a warming solar loyalty together . This looked like being a long voyage , as some of the ship 's essential equipment had been destroyed , and we could not go into complete time blackout . We could slow down our basic metabolism so that there would be no trouble about food , atmosphere and so on , and so that time was partially dealt with , but we were certainly expending some energy and time in calculations and plans . After the first wonderful elation of returning life , I began to feel less well , and was uncertain of what the cause could be . Shock , I supposed . I asked Vly if all the Martians had found themselves equally in shock . He said that it was so , and added that most of the group discovered within a day or two that they had been sent into a condition of active mono - sexuality . '

( I translate as nearly as I can into Terran . ) By that time I was able to think so completely in Martian images and feelings that our communication was easy and always affectionate . Most of this was being done face to face and with finger tips . I did look , and when he pointed it out it was clear that even in their strictly practical protective suits , there was a certain differentiation . Yes , one could even see it in their faces , although their actual sexual organs showed little change , which was not unexpected considering how much they were used as areas not of sexual 63 activity , but of communication . ‘

She was very like her beautiful grandmother . We had established a very good relationship and I thought I could explain to her some aspects of the work . 69 Then I ran into T'o M'Kasi again , quite by accident , in the restaurant of an airport where I was complaining about the fruit – they really might have it fresh there , of all places ! Then he heard me and came over . I saw him against the flowers on the terrace and I was n't interested in complaining any more , luckily for the airport chef . We started talking and I found his voice just the same . And his hands . We both missed our planes . He told me that the expedition he was preparing for was due to start almost at once , as soon as the checks were all through ; one piece of faulty apparatus had to be replaced . I had to be quick . Not that there was any difficulty . No question of other choices this time . And before I knew where I was , I was in no condition to go on Pete 's expedition . I had , however , talked to them about the advisability of taking some of the laboratory animals , and finally Pete decided to take Daisy the Labrador , and one of the jackals , Kali , who was particularly quick and intelligent and another friend of mine . I was delighted about this , because otherwise , if I joined an expedition after my new baby , as of course I intended to do , I might never have seen them again , short - lived and timebound as they were . It was most unusual to put members of other animal communities into time blackout . But these two , who had been brought up in a laboratory ambience , were different and could take in more human concepts . I gave them a preliminary idea so that , when the moment came , they would be at least co - operative . Normally the animal house technicians are non - exploring , cosy - box types ; but one of them decided he would like to go with Daisy and Kali . He was in some way a badly integrated man , and he really wanted to get away altogether from his group a different outlook from that of an explorer , but it seemed to fit in . T'o and I came to the ‘
23982	27934	23515	23515	she	116	' and saw them off . In a way I was half regretful . But not deeply . You may say I could have waited , but T'o was going on what was considered a dangerous piece of exploration ; as a matter of fact he came back safe , but two others lost their lives . Anyhow there was a year of stabilising for another baby , three years of my life on Terra in the grip of time ! 70 - 2 But I really had a delicious year , with my curly , coffeecoloured daughter and my blue - eyed toddler so unlike her beginning to talk and understand about numbers and distances and categories . And then there was little Viola , whom I could help to overcome her haploid difficulties and develop the talents which she could best use . Oh , I felt just like a twentiethcentury Mum ! I did everything . I sang and danced to them , I fed their measurements into the wooli - warm slots ; I taught them to handle bees and spiders gently and understandingly , I stabilised them , I whispered to them the binomial and the basic equations and all that , when they were half asleep . I introduced them to their age group , withdrawing progressively as they became integrated . It must have been just like that in the old days , being a Mum . Only I could get away , that was the difference . How marvellous it was , in spite of tiny prickles of regret , to be back in a ship among my instruments and tables , thinking intently and uninterruptedly . And marvellous too , after thought , to go into meditation and out of time . Yet somehow I have always felt a little closer to Viola . Integration for her could never be a hundred per cent complete . She still , I think , needs me a little , even to share her happinesses and successes . The physical delicacies could be overcome , but I always feel that , as her sole real parent , I have a double responsibility . The fact that Vly 's accidental activation started her development made him a kind of parent , and has inhibited his natural feelings of revulsion towards a Terran female . Besides , he likes her small size . He has deliberately made opportunities to visit Terra , making sure that I would be there , and we have often seen her together . There is something about it all that makes me sure it is a plus fact in the great moral equation . The next expedition , on which there were two Martian participants , was to a world of great beauty , but not altogether easy . The atmosphere , though not really dangerous , was thick , and the gravity was such that we found ourselves managing best with flippers and a semi - swimming movement . One had to accustom one 's muscles to this . The bird - fish who were the main inhabitants screwed themselves along with a propellerish motion of glistening membranes . There was a long and stream- 71 a ing vegetation in a glory of soft colours . This opened and closed all round us , while the bird - fish , unalarmed , screwed themselves past . The dominant species was rather like a dolphin , large brained and large eyed , but equally progressing with a corkscrew motion . We are well used to treating dolphins and dolphinoids as our intellectual equals , or , on certain subjects , superiors , so it was not too difficult to enter into communication . The unfortunate thing was that we reminded them of a form of life which they had lately exterminated , one could understand why . It was difficult to get across very quickly that we were in fact something different . And they laid a kind of trap for us , something like an electric fence , only with a different type of power . It was one of the two Martians who was caught . In these circumstances there is always a psychological difficulty about a mixed expedition . The Terrans were in a way relieved that it was not one of themselves , though they tried to compensate towards the remaining Martian , who felt resentment and an enhancement of his normal repulsion towards humans . But again we attempted to overcome it , so that an artificial situation arose . I was genuinely upset . I had got on well with the dead Martian , who was a relation of Vly do n't ask me to explain Martian relationships ! – and I felt it was partly my fault at not being quicker on my communications . However , we did manage finally to get in touch with the dolphinoids . It is always easier when the fauna are on a recognisable scale . The real difficulty comes when there is , for example , some type of intelligence spreading thinly over an entire galaxy . Or again , when we just do not recognise the major forms of life as on Jones 97 . As I became more skilled and practised , I was able to do more about this , though with some very remote forms none of us have yet managed to get on to communication . As you know , certain galaxies are not visited , and indeed we keep a rather careful watch on them . Even within galaxies where we have a certain contact , or where life has only occurred very sporadically , there are certain systems which we do not intend to visit yet . The time may come - I am sure it will - when we shall . - - 72 break through . I have one or two ideas which my group is working on , but much research and experiment is needed , and we can not expect to get very rapid results . One of the oddest of these worlds , all the more so as the answer was so obvious once one saw it - came on a Minerals expedition . It was my first experience of the Minerals Ministry people , and at first I did n't find them congenial ; they were n't quite like explorers ; they were more obviously experts on one particular field and method , taking in whatever was useful to them from other scientific disciplines , but somehow without widely developed curiosity , man 's supreme gift . However , they were doing a very necessary job on Minerals research , and gradually I got to like them . There was one man who had fallen head over heels in love with the screen image of my little Viola ; by this time she had made quite a name for herself in the television games . I had done two expeditions since her birth , and , though it seemed a short time for me , it had given her time for growing up and success . Though would this be all ? If she was really happy , I half hoped so , but she was still subadult . And when she was adult ? During our last long - distance communication , she had giggled to me about some letters she had , very serious ones I gathered , and this Ministry man was the writer . I was careful never to tell him I knew , all the same . Viola is , of course , infertile , and perhaps this is just as well , because she would have been much too small to have a child by a human father . Her size did not seem to worry her at all at the moment . She was with a group of other young people , and I thought that she was probably not suffering at all because in one respect she was different from the others . That might have made things difficult at some points in Terran history , but by now we 've got used to behaving politely to living entities of so many shapes and kinds that a mere difference in size is nothing . During part of the time blackout on this voyage , I was in meditation , but my technique was not sufficiently developed and kept slipping off into nothingness . When I finally came back to full time and being , we were in orbit round a world which seemed to consist on its surface of evenly convex hills thickly wooded , or at any rate covered in some way . We could see no 73 oceans , only occasionally a darkness which might be water between these round hills . The mineralogists were already aware , through spectroscopic analysis and other techniques , that there were some very valuable materials in this world . You could see they were all on edge to get at them . The fact is we use up minerals too fast . We had a lot of arguments about that . We made our landing space by the usual preliminary clearing technique , trying to give as much warning as possible to all fauna by means of uncomfortable but not deadly noise , heat and blast before the actual clearing . It was routine , but always makes me uncomfortable . We might unwittingly destroy some life which was not induced to move out by any of these stimuli , and of course we destroyed vegetation . However , one has little choice . The atmosphere and gravity problem was not too serious , and the mineralogists , who always take far too little acclimatisation time , went scurrying off with a variety of clicking and humming machines which meant absolutely nothing to me , though I had become personally rather interested in one of them , a young man called Quinag - a smoothy , but what a delicious smoothy ! I could n't think what he was doing in the Ministry , but surmised that he might have misbehaved at some time . The man who wrote the letters to Viola could never have misbehaved . Peder Pedersen was there too . It was , he said , his last voyage , and he had refused to come as leader , not feeling that he had any longer the necessary strength and flexibility . Our actual leader was that strange woman who called herself 513 because she had been one of the group that had discarded names - and indeed a great deal else . The Ministry trusted her , probably told her secrets ; they were great ones for that kind of thing . At first we did some straight old - fashioned exploring ; I could find no species with which to get into communication , though there were some small forms scuttling mouselike or crablike through interstices of the thick growth which covered the hills , as well as some still smaller winged forms , often brightcoloured . The predominant growth was actually of three kinds . 74 . a There was a tall , cylindrical , flexible growth which moved in a rhythmic way . After watching these for some time we realised that they had a very simple snapping head , two jaws - but were they jaws or toughened , thick leaves ? - which opened and closed and occasionally caught one of the winged forms , whatever they were . There were somewhat thicker growths with feathery tops which waved and shivered ; I felt that these were definitely animal , to use a rather archaic classification , and was prepared to watch carefully before making any observations which would result in destroying or injuring one of them . And then there were curious and beautiful blunt - topped hexagonal forms , knobbed and striped and radiated in splendid colours . What were they ? They were hard , rocky , perhaps , we thought , coralline . For a time we had been unable not to think of them as artefacts , as columns of some extraordinary temple , and yet that seemed improbable , especially as they seemed to grow out of the underlying hard rock which was only , as far as we could make out , covered to a depth of a few centimetres with dust and debris . However , it did set us off on to searching for some skilled intelligences which could somehow have made these columns . If we had found them they could surely have been communicated with ! However , they excited our mineralogists extremely since it appeared that some of the brilliant colouring was due to traces of the rare mineral for which they were looking . They immediately chopped off specimens and took them back to the ship , and excitedly discussed possibilities of large scale removal . 513 said dryly that we had better first find out what these objects were , what their use was , and to what or whom . It was just as well ; even chipping off pieces as casually as they had done was a little bit unethical and worried some of us . We were n't quite used to the ways of the Ministry . A little more exploration took us down the slopes to the edge of the dark , curving lakes round the bases of the great , rounded hills . There was no beach , only a thick clustering of the snappers which arched themselves into the top layer of the water - it was water , though with a number of minerals in it in heavy solution , and quite undrinkable . This top layer was packed with a life of a 75 > a fairly low order ; we took a number of specimens . There were mats of vegetation , mostly large , single cells strung together , but some a little more complex , any amount of material for our taxonomists who had a lovely time comparing all this with lifeforms from other worlds in the same galaxy and elsewhere . The scuttlers , it was clear , had developed from an aquatic form , but probably found conditions safer beyond the top layer of water , though they sometimes came down into it to feed . But I did n't find any kind of consciousness with which I could possibly establish communication , still less anything which might have made the columns . There had been some argument about getting down to the lake . We had to push or edge our way with some difficulty between the snappers , the feathered plumes and the hard columns . The snappers were perfectly harmless as far as we were concerned ; there was nothing that could hurt even an ungloved hand . But the mineralogists , who were interested in bringing up large quantities of water for analysis , wanted to cut and level the way . Peder and I were against this . So , luckily , was 513 , who finally told the Ministry people they must wait . When they grumbled about waste of time , she gave them a lecture on the nature of time which kept them quiet . Quinag meanwhile was occupied in seducing me . There is no more pleasing way of passing the odd half - hour when nothing more important is happening , and as there seemed to be no conscious life with which I could establish communication though I kept worrying away at this , trying out and discarding various hypotheses - I thought I was quite likely to have quite a few spare half - hours . But I made up my mind that he would be a most unsuitable father ; one does , after all , demand more than good looks and expertise . He had a second string in his own party , a girl called Soo , whose heart clearly was not in mineralogy . I thought she was a bit un - adult for a space expedition . We found ourselves increasingly with two interests . One group wanted above all to find out what kind of world this was , what was the nature , reason for , and result of , these identical rounded hills , each of which – about this time we had made our way on to several others – had the same covering . We found 76 a . our inflating boats perfectly adequate and pushed our way through the snappers . These were not hard enough to be more than a mild nuisance , even if they happened to catch one 's arm or the blade of a paddle - the lakes were too narrow to make any kind of engine necessary but we found they ingested pieces of malted bread with no trouble , and often used to feed them , especially if we wanted to quiet them while we made our own observations on the top layer of fauna and flora . I spent quite a bit of my time on this kind of thing , as I could n't get on with my own job ; still it always keeps one fresh to work within other people 's discipline . There was an astonishing multiplicity of very small forms ; we began to call them after one another , and then after all our friends . We were in two minds about investigation of the snappers and feathery growths . They might have consciousness ; one had seen forms as odd in other worlds ; however , we did investigate those near the edge of our clearing ; they seemed to have roots going deep down into the rocks . But there was no evidence of consciousness . But the other group consisted of the mineralogists who , having satisfied themselves that the specimens of material which they had analysed were all that they 'd hoped , now wanted to take back as much as the ship would hold . They were also evaporating out a good deal of the water . But it was the hard columns which really interested them . Some had been destroyed in the clearing technique for our landing , and most of the debris bad blown away ; as in so many worlds , there was a continual one - way wind blowing , not heavy , but never still . They cut down two or three columns near the edge , and found that it was only the first two or three centimetres down from the outside that interested them ; most of the minerals were concentrated in the beautiful knobs and ridgings which differed slightly from one specimen to the next , though they were always more or less in the same general pattern . Inside the hard core was obviously of animal origin - but when ? At what point were they connected with life ? When would we , I thought , find a young one ? Was there some obvious clue that had escaped us ? That was what 513 thought , and said it was probably quite clear but 77 we must continually change our focus : at some point the explanation would emerge . I kept trying to change my focus , but , while changing it , accidentally meeting Quinag . Some of us tried looking in the upper layers of the water for any kind of fauna which could build up structures of this kind , perhaps in colonies . We found a few , but they were all minute and yet appeared to be adult ; that was not the explanation . We were also watching for any regeneration on the cleared area of any of the forms . We did some experiments in situ , and found that the plumose type was a breather , though we could not see what it ingested . Gradually we all began to wonder if there was some connection between the three forms , especially when we found that where the mineralogists had taken a column , the snapper next to it began to droop and become inactive , and the plumose forms did not expand fully . And was this all ? Peder Pedersen thought he had found some kind of tremor . The instruments corroborated him , though it was not very marked . I had not noticed it myself . We began to work out a theory of connections , but they would have to be below the level of the surface rock , or through the atmosphere ; this latter seemed more probable and we set up various types of experimental interceptors . If the removal of a column was going to destroy or seriously harm the other forms , we would have to be careful about interference . The mineralogists , meanwhile , went on collecting , though Quinag was not in practice very diligent . From the top of our own hill we could see all round , one hill after another , all more or less alike , each divided from the next by a broader or narrower strip of dark , deep water . I was up there looking out from between two columns . I was feeling rather irritated , because this was a leisure moment and Quinag had gone away with Soo . I was saying to myself that this kind of petty resentment was most unsuitable for an explorer of my age and experience , but still I felt the pricklings of it . The snappers waved above my head . I began to concentrate and watch . I felt suddenly that I was on the point of realising what was what in this world if only I could see the connections more . I managed to shake off all thoughts of Quinag and concentrated still further . It seemed to me that 1 78 something curious was happening . One of the further hills was very slowly rising , and at the same time two others seemed to sink . Perhaps , I thought , this bad happened before but we had never stayed long enough to notice . One ceased to move ; the others still seemed to be dropping into the sea , though it was difficult to be sure with these completely round and featureless objects all with the same covering . Yes , one of them at least was going down . And suddenly I realised that this landscape of columns and snappers was exactly what one sees under a low power microscope looking at a sea urchin . These hills were simply enormous echinoderms . I was caught with laughter . It was all so obvious . And of course so dangerous . The dark water had come up round that other hill , or rather the hill had sunk ; it was only a small round island . But had these vast echinoderms evolved any kind of consciousness or intelligence ? Could one get into any kind of contact ? What stimulus made them rise and fall ? What were they like underneath ? How could one find out ? I went straight to 513 . '

29188	29521	31706	31706	Olga	109	' But somehow one never completely forgets . Though drowning is a mild death for an explorer . Only he was n't really an explorer . Not like Peder and me . Explorers are likely to have crueller deaths . But , being explorers , they know how to meet them . 82 7 Later on I had a child by Peder Pedersen , a blond son . He had only been a father once before , and his first son had been killed in an exploration disaster on his second voyage . He told me about that after the time blackout on our way back , when I was still considerably upset ; it was good for me to realise what had happened to others . Material evidence had been collected later , and it was not the kind of death that one would like to envisage for any of one 's children . In a part of his mind Peder was still uncomforted , though he could give so much comfort to other people . He thought he was not going to do any more real exploring , perhaps an occasional conference in our own galaxy , but nothing far - fetched . He would be a parent at hand for any of my children , and he would take Viola with him one day to visit her father . After spending a month or two with Peder I found myself wondering why there had not been a rush to choose him as a father . I think he had said no , probably more than once . Meanwhile , there had been some mass grafting at the centre , and I was very anxious to know what had been happening about it . I had been away for some time in Terran years , and the handsome young man was he 18 or 28 , one ca n't tell once one is past adolescence oneself ! was Pete and Silis '
31725	31734	31706	31706	Olga	109	' I said , and she whispered back , '
31741	32081	31706	31706	Olga	109	' That seemed to ease things a little . She stooped and picked up the flower , putting it quickly away in her vasculum ; it did not seem to affect her , and I was glad it was out of sight . Otherwise I might have been compelled to try and restore it to its original place . Gradually the feeling of guilty misery cleared away . Now I only wanted to restore communication , even by pain , with whatever it was that had communicated . Olga managed one photograph . When it was developed we 88 went into conference over it . It looked as though this was a flying insect form which we had dismissed . It was Nadira , I think , who suggested first and rather shyly , because she was the least experienced of the team , that perhaps the caterpillars were caterpillars whose adult form had at last appeared . But we had some hesitation about accepting this hypothesis , and we saw no more of the butterflies for some time . Meanwhile we had made a good deal of progress in communication with the caterpillars . At first we had concentrated on the simple pleasure - pain complex . This was made easier when Françoise discovered that the creatures enjoyed being touched , at any rate in certain parts of their bodies . She was the one to develop a sympathy with them . began to have great hopes of her ; it looked as if her heart was in the job . It was her third expedition , and between whiles she had spent some time with my group , so I knew her fairly well , though perhaps Nadira , who was nearer to her in subjective age , knew her better . It is , of course , quite uncertain on any expedition which of a team will be the one to have this sympathy or empathy with other forms of life which we still tend to call '
32083	32388	33557	33557	they	589	' . But it usually happens , and is extremely important and useful . Françoise taught me how to handle the creatures to their satisfaction , thus making my work of communication much easier . A great deal of their pleasure consisted in eating and evacuation . There was normally a good deal of waste cellulose in their food , which came out in pellets of several dark and shining colours . These formed the basis of quite elaborate pattern structures , which obviously gave great aesthetic pleasure to those who arranged and those who came to look at them . The caterpillars would caress these pellets with their soft blunted legs , and keep up a continual chorus of pleasure sounds , surrounding the successful artist with touch and apparently praise . We could ourselves see the interest of these patterns , mostly asymmetrical , but not without mathematical significance ; deep blues and reds predominated , and the smell was not unpleasant . When they saw that we were interested , the caterpillars made room for us , and it was at these times we managed our earliest 1 89 - successful communications . Gradually we all came to like the caterpillars more and more , and to feel that this liking was reciprocated Françoise had thought this pattern making might have some biological significance . Even under intimate inspection and handling , we had been unable to distinguish any sexual characteristics among these creatures , and this in itself suggested a larval form whose sex would only appear in the adult . Yet we could not be sure . It was again Françoise who , through her sympathy with the creatures , arrived at some kind of solution . By this time we were managing a certain degree of communication on the '
32396	33553	33604	33604	They	589	' level . Clearly , they realised we were friends , with some of the same interests as themselves , not like the wood crabs which were among the carnivores and their special enemies . We used to take our rations and eat them where the creatures could observe us . This roused their sympathy , though they then wanted to see the results of the digestive process . I believe Françoise obliged , but they found the product aesthetically disappointing , and tried to express to her their pity and even some thoughts on how a better result could be achieved . This was a first important point of higher communication between our groups . It was soon after this that Françoise realised what was happening in the bogs of violet algae , and that for a time put us off the larval track since it turned out to be a prolonged sexual wallow in which a number of individuals took part . The actual process was not clear , and it did not seem likely that the caterpillars were male and female in any direct sense . What resulted , however , was not only a curious type of fertilisation , whose significance became apparent later , but also a rise in temperature and a great accession of pleasure . We had by this time induced them to allow us to take an occasional blood sample , and it was then that we found , after the wallow and very much to our surprise , a general cell mitosis going on . The same individuals would go back several times for successive wallowing . The caterpillars in their affectionate concern for Françoise wanted her to share this experience , and she would , I am sure , 90 have made an attempt to join them but that our breathing apparatus was unsuitable for this type of work . However , our contacts were going very satisfactorily , and our note - books were filling , when events took another turn . These bog wallowings normally took place when the two moons were up together ; if we augmented them with our powerful ray torches more of the caterpillars seemed to come and they stayed under for longer . They ate heavily during the period of fertilisation , so that afterwards there was great aesthetic activity with the residue , which was more highly coloured than usual . Every piece of flat ground was covered with their patterns , or with the production of material for them . At the same time , the level of the bog was perceptibly lower after the caterpillars came out . We had not yet discovered the whereabouts of the next stage of reproductive activity , nor could we get any enlightenment about it from the caterpillars themselves , but I think we all hoped at any moment to arrive on some aspect of reproduction . We had never seen any caterpillars under eight centimetres long . We were watching this gathering one night at the bottom of the cleft which , among ourselves , we usually called Wardour Street . Funny how much of ancient London has survived ! We had a great feeling of sympathy and warmth towards the creatures , partly because we were all women . We leant over and watched , the rays of our torches augmenting the moons . Françoise and Nadira were whispering ; our recording and transmitting apparatuses were all at full adjustment . The caterpillars were wriggling in , the colours pulsating through the soft semi - transparence of their skins ; their legs worked eagerly , their eye spots shone . Several of them got into happy communication with us . They did not resent the fact that we were there and watching them , in fact they seemed to welcome us . And then wings were descending on us or rather not on us but on the caterpillars . We only felt the side - swipe of the feelings that were being projected upon the creatures . I recognised it as the same sense of guilt that had come on me when I picked the flowers , and my immediate reaction was of extreme resent- 91 ment on behalf of the caterpillars , whose delight was shattered . One saw it from their behaviour even before communication came through : communication which was a pitiable crying for help , so that I thought suddenly and guiltily - a quite irrational and disquieting feeling - of my own little children , most of all Viola and my little curly - gold Jon , Peder 's son . The wretched caterpillars curled up or crept aside , the colours paled , the eye spots dimmed . They seemed to shrivel as from an inward searing . We watched with intent sympathy , not knowing whether or how to act ourselves . Yet we were also aware of the attackers , the whirl and flurry of wings , the colours beyond anything I have ever perceived on any planet of any sun , the antennae stiff and pointing like weapons of offence , the legs glittering and jointed as strange armour might have been . There were several of them , and for a moment one or another might be poised so that it could be seen , as doubtless it could see us from its flashing and faceted jewel eyes , now diamond , now sapphire or emerald . But it was beyond us what was happening , or why this anger and judgement was being projected on to the wretched crawlers in the bog of algae . Two of the caterpillars had crawled right up to Françoise . She leant over and stroked and handled the poor things . I did the same when one came to me , but I noticed that my own hand was shaking . Even if one is not directly under it , such a torrent of blame is unnerving . And what had our poor soft friends done ? There was a moment when it seemed to me that this was becoming intelligible , when I too began to regard the cowering unhappy creatures as somehow blameworthy . Then the contact fuzzed up , the wings lifted , the butterflies were gone . a 92 8 We looked round at the caterpillars . We had wondered if some of them were actually dead , but that was not so . Those which had seemed stricken into complete rigor slowly relaxed and edged away , their boneless legs scarcely walking . None of them went back into the purple bog . Those which were nearest to us began to communicate , at first in a formless misery and complaint , which gradually turned into something more coherent which I could almost translate into words : '
33619	33687	33729	33729	they	589	' Françoise and I communicated reassurance , yet we wondered . Were our friends in fact changed ? Would they never be able to delight again in their multiple fertilising wallow in the deep bogs ? Had their masters been so fundamentally cruel as to cut them off from this ? If so , why ? We felt we had to question our friends . We tried the '

33841	33849	33864	33864	we	591	' What happens when you are old ? '

33898	33915	33956	33956	they	589	' We tried another tack . We asked whether the invaders for whom the caterpillars had a '

33931	33940	34006	34006	they	589	' , ever came at any other time . '
34017	34146	34006	34006	they	589	' It was difficult not to find this moving . We went into conference on it . Françoise had several of the creatures with her , in fact they would not leave her . We could see no physical damage on them , but they were obviously hurt ; their colours were dim , they had no vitality ; their communication with us constantly broke down into inarticulate misery . We all stroked them and tried to communicate ; they did not , of course , understand what we were saying to one another . One thing which we were deciding was that we must do furtheir exploration . We had gone fairly slowly in a territorial sense . The earliest expeditions had wasted their energies and equipment on '
34148	34169	34925	34925	I	0	' , whereas present tendencies are all towards acclimatisation and the kind of detailed knowledge of a locus which makes it '
34171	34924	34925	34925	I	0	' . Thus , we ourselves had concentrated on intense study of a small area , and specifically on communication with the caterpillars , as also with one or two other species , though no other had developed sufficient consciousness for this . We had not attempted any physically difficult explora- 94 tion , especially as we were not adapted to either the touch or the odour of some of the flora , which had quite an unpleasant effect on us . Miss Hayes and I had decided , when preparing the expedition , that we would not over - burden ourselves with transport equipment ; one 's space , after all , is limited , and even a light hoverer takes up a great deal . Also , of course , the interposition of any material substance between oneself and one 's problem makes communication more difficult . However , now we must think again . If , as seemed likely , these creatures were larval forms of their attackers , we must try and find the intermediate stages : the egg , intermediate between butterfly and caterpillar , and the chrysalis or similar form , intermediate between caterpillar and butterfly . Miss Hayes was the first to get up and leave the conference . She , as one of the older generation , had more the feeling for exploration in space ; her empathy towards other species had been less developed . She had done more of the lagoon work of systematic classification . And she liked working by herself ; it was likely that , on some future expedition , she would get herself into some position where she would die , equally alone , but making important observations . That would be her choice . How happy , if one 's death coincides with one 's death choice ! We did not expect her back for some hours , perhaps longer . The rest of us were concerned about the number of caterpillars that had come and put themselves , at it were , under our protection , and from whom we gathered that there had been further punishment from their flying lords and oppressors . We had decided that we must put up some type of ray - grid protection overhead , which might at least give reassurance to our guests , none of which were feeding . Luckily Peder had not only shown me how to set one up , but had also persuaded Miss Hayes to take the very newest type . We got it out , and Olga and I started feeding into the baby computer . It was rather fascinating to watch it adjusting itself . Then Miss Hayes came back , to say that she had seen one or two specimens of the caterpillars which were clearly dead and being eaten by the wood crabs . We were really upset . Poor soft , unhappy things ! And what 95 Miss Hayes had seen and we were all speaking about must , through its very vehemence , have broken through into communication which was , as it were , overheard . For the caterpillar beside me began to communicate in what was a surprisingly personal way . In general , theirs had always been a collective communication range . But this one seemed to be trying to express the thought that direct death from attack by the wood crabs was terrible but understandable . This death from the butterflies was not understandable , because not inflicted for food . The wood crabs were feeding now , but that was no part of the death intention . And a body which was not killed for eating should be shut , should be still , should be not seen . That was correct , as killing for eating was correct . But what was happening was not correct . It was wrong , wrong , and now it was bound to go on happening , here or there . The masters , the punishers , they always struck blow after blow . When one thought they were away , back they came . I explained the ray - grid as best I could , and the protection it should give . One of the navigators had begun picking up caterpillars and moving them under it . But my friend was uncomforted , weaved its head with the strange , prominent eyes to and fro . '

The nausea and pain were standing away from me ; soon I could get on to my feet . What followed was a long and interesting technical discussion on how to break up the communications from the butterflies into something intelligible for ourselves , that is to say , on the whole , statements with implications of opposites , not the complete synthesis of these conveyed states of theirs . It would , we thought , need some co - operation from them . We ourselves must try to simplify and synthesise our own communications . Meanwhile , how little of the old happy caterpillar activity there seemed to be ! No making of art forms , no wallowings . We did , however , see rather more of the smaller younger caterpillars , but they seemed to do little communicating , even with one another , and their activities seemed unco - ordinated . Had the older ones been able to pass on to them the legend and terror of the descending butterflies ? Had they been warned ? Françoise was extremely depressed ; she had become more involved than any of us have a right to be . After all our experience in space exploration , we from Terra ought to know better than to let our soft hearts go over the problems of another species or another completely alien form of life . Yet that is exactly what we do , time after time . Françoise used to go and cry over the old patterns of excrement which were now drying up and blowing about . Nadira used to go with her sometimes and sympathise , as did one of the navigators . Miss Hayes sent off on long expeditions , in the course of one of which she lost the top joint of one of her fingers . Olga was writing notes . She found it best to get her botanical specimens by night , as 102 during the day she was more likely to be attacked by the butterflies . She was much the least susceptible of any of us to their communication of anger and blame , but even she tended to find them oppressive . Meanwhile I myself was working solidly on the communication problem . Luckily my opposite numbers on the butterfly side had been working along the same lines . But indeed it was not a matter of luck ; as far as I can make out , we had the only solution . At any rate our co - ordinates agreed . We were all there , as it happened , when the butterflies came down . Françoise had brought along two half - grown caterpillars and was fondling them . They had just started elementary pattern - making , and she was feeling a little cheered up . When Olga pointed and shouted , she picked up the caterpillars and threw her arms over them . There were two of these butterflies , one of which was predominantly in patterns or rhythms of red which tended sometimes to disappear into a kind of grey – and yet that is not the word for it – which was difficult to look at , giving one a kind of visual shock . Presumably it was an infra - red colour which we could not see . I found this both with the predominantly reds and also the predominantly blues , where one had the same experience with the ultra - violet . The other butterfly was in the middle hues of the spectrum . They began to communicate in what one might have called speech had it been in the auditory range . Or rather , the red one did this for me , after certain adjustments , but the other was occupying itself by throwing down a blast of blame on to Françoise . I was so interested in this opening up of the closed circuit that I did not even notice , until Françoise yelled . I had no idea of how thoroughly the old gutter argot had survived , at any rate among ex - students of the Sorbonne . Even the butterfly was for a moment checked by the intensity and singlemindedness of her emotional state . Then it started again . We had a small section of ray - grid still in place , and Olga dashed to the computer for more , while Françoise ducked under , holding her caterpillars , and , regrettably , spat . Obviously the ray - grid did not completely protect her or her caterpillars a 103 from the butterfly . I could see them writhing and curling up , and managed to convey to the red butterfly that this must stop before we could go on communicating . I shall now try to put into sentences the substance of our communication , all , of course , from notes taken at the time by each of us separately and then collated ; we did not all get the same sense and occasionally the whole thing became uncertain , nor do I think our own communications were always intelligible to them . Later on we both improved things . The butterflies had obviously meant to begin in some other way , but they were deflected by Françoise and her caterpillars . '
38498	38507	38508	38508	I	0	' they said . “ It is wrong . '
38511	38533	38535	38535	They	629	' We all want to help them . They are soft , they are sad . Why must you hurt them ? '

38586	38623	38633	38633	They	629	' The butterflies did not like it when I expressed that ; the vibrations jarred ; and yet it was something they knew . Then the red one expressed itself carefully , and with distaste apparent ; '
38637	38672	38633	38633	They	629	' I agreed . The butterfly turned fierce and quivering antennae on Françoise and I got the feeling , subsequently confirmed , that these antennae were highly directional , could concentrate the emotional communications . '
38677	38682	38701	38701	they	629	' the butterfly said . '
38697	38698	38701	38701	they	629	' '
38706	38738	38701	38701	they	629	' I asked . The red butterfly did not communicate for a moment , and the other one darted angrily over the ray - grid . Then the red one said : '
38755	38773	38790	38790	I	0	' Here the communication blurred . The wings - are hurt . Wings - do not come . '
38786	38789	38990	38991	the butterflies	1567	' Why ? '
38992	39084	39094	39094	We	630	' theory was correct , and felt that it would require anatomical observations to check on it . Françoise , who after all , had not seen the halfwinged creatures emerge from the chrysalis , simply did not believe them . She tried to say that they merely wanted power , and had invented this story to justify themselves , but , fortunately perhaps , did not manage to convey it , except as a complete state of disbelief . Suddenly one of the butterflies communicated again , obviously about her : '
39099	39185	39218	39218	Nadira	126	' And they whirled away as quickly as they had come . This left us plenty to discuss and we began , uncomfortably , to find ourselves taking sides . Miss Hayes found the butterflies a most interesting form of life , a possible intellectual stimulant and contact . Françoise said coldly that what they had put across was impossible , and untrue . She could feel the cruelty and hatred behind these ideas . She fondled the two small caterpillars who unstiffened a little . '
39198	39217	42719	42719	Françoise	125	' she said . " We can not desert them . At any rate , I can not . '
40026	40104	42719	42719	Françoise	125	' activities , but meriting a sharp attack . This was partly physical in its effect because it was used to ward off some of the other forms of insect life , which might have damaged the flowers , but which were perhaps not susceptible to the state of total blame which was their other form of attack ; hence the purely physical pricking sensation which I had experienced myself . The red one wanted to know why '
40106	40332	42719	42719	Françoise	125	' had picked the flowers . I explained that Olga only wanted one specimen of each and wanted it to think about , and that she was preserving them carefully . I realised with some difficulty that they wanted to see this . Olga got out one of our best specimens . Naturally , with the problems of packing all our material into a quite restricted space during transport back , it was not in Museum 107 condition . I found it impossible to get them to understand the further processes which would take it back into something approaching its real beauty . Both butterflies became extremely agitated . They felt , I think , that Olga had taken , not merely the flower , but its colour , texture and scent . Every now and then both sent out a shower of prickles which I disliked more than Olga did . I tried to soothe them with the concept that this uninviting object could not only be restored , but would be used for purposes of knowledge and admiration . But it was hard to make out what was getting through in the state of agitation the butterflies were in . Suddenly they turned and shot away with wing flaps too rapid to be visible ; in a moment they were out of sight . '
40335	41668	42719	42719	Françoise	125	' said Olga , and shook herself like a dog coming out of water . 108 9 The usual minor navigational difficulties about our return were having to be solved , as such comparatively mathematical problems normally can be solved , given the right effort and equipment . But the feeling that the expedition was divided in mind , and perhaps even in object , was not at all pleasant , and limited the co - operation which was vital at this stage . Françoise spent all her time encouraging a group of young caterpillars which were growing fast , except for the few which had been permanently damaged , and on which she seemed to us to be lavishing a quite irrational amount of care and affection . As for the rest , she said , rather defiantly , that they would soon be at the pattern - making , and then the bog - wallowing stage . I was considerably worried about this , especially as I had been visited two or three times by the butterflies , and had managed to clarify certain points . But Françoise seemed at the moment to be immune to ordinary argument and reason . One of the navigators , who had turned out to have quite a flair for our type of communication , was strongly on her side . Miss Hayes now went off on an exploration of her own , partly , I believe , in order to think all this out , and it was while clambering around in the far end of one of the clefts that she accidentally found one of our missing clues . She told me afterwards that she had attributed the sense of grief which was gradually beginning to overwhelm her , the 109 further she went , to worry about the expedition and to fear that Françoise 's present irrationality might spread to other subjects , and could easily make the take - off more difficult and dangerous , not only to ourselves but to our specimens . Yet normally this type of worry would have induced her to take mental action at least . Now it was becoming more and more oppressive , jerking her back to Terran experiences which she had long sublimated and which , in the ordinary way , she could recollect with calm and often enough amusement . Now they weighed her down ; she felt a sense of irreparable loss , as though she had suddenly realised that her whole working life had been a dream . At some point , it seemed , she had taken a wrong decision : nothing afterwards had any value . So strong was this feeling that she had almost stopped observing , and in this state she very nearly walked into the source as she realised with the kind of relief that comes with waking out of nightmare of all this storm of grief . It was , of course , a butterfly laying and dying . The enormous and beautiful something which we knew was normally revolting to the butterflies . Its antennae drooped , its sensitive claw feet gripped and relaxed , gripped and relaxed . Shudders of colours , broken rhythms , went through its wings , and the eggs poured out , tearing its body and leaving a trail on the algae which gradually sank , not perhaps to the bottom , but at least below the surface . It was difficult to be certain whether or not it was in pain as we ourselves and many other Terran and extra - Terran species know such sensations . What it was sending out was waves of grief and discouragement of the deepest kind . As soon as she was aware of what was happening , Miss Hayes tried to contact it with compassion . Yet perhaps pure compassion is too human a thing : it did not appear to be effective . Though this occurred to Miss Hayes it might yet not be the whole story . She began to think that belonging as she did to a slightly older generation than the rest of us , she might not be quite up in the latest techniques of communication ; it seemed possible that I or one of the others would be more successful . She sent out a general call for the rest of us , and we all hurried to the place she had indicated . Here at last was the link we had not yet found . 110 Olga and I happened to be the nearest , as we were making some botanical and ecological observations . When we arrived and found ourselves in the area of grief , we too attempted communication , but it seemed impossible . In an older day maternity must have been equally painful for Terran mothers – if , that is , the pain of torn tissues on one planet can ever be equated with those on another . Yet these mothers always had the feeling of pride and achievement and creation which to some extent overcame the pain and fear . With them it was a beginning of maternal feelings ; active pride would turn into passive patience , creation into solicitude towards the thing created : something near our present - day feelings . But the butterfly had no maternal feelings , could not have . It was no part of this evolutionary pattern . The eggs would look after themselves , even if a few perished , and when they hatched it would be into something utterly alien from their mother , and , again , capable of survival on their own . Maternal feelings could have had no outlet . The butterfly 's egg - laying then was pure loss . Nor could we convey to her that she was in any way continuing life , was part of some process which we did not try to explain , only to communicate as some kind of consolation . The butterfly seemed feebler ; the colours in her spread palpitating wings were less bright . She did not appear to see . Only a few eggs were now emerging from the dreadfully torn end of the oviduct – or was it a real oviduct ? Perhaps it was simply a way torn and blasted through the tissues of the abdomen by sheer physical pressure . We would , we hoped , be able to investigate this later . How many eggs had been laid ? Miss Hayes did not know for certain because by the time she had arrived the process was well under way . Probably the first laid eggs were already below the algal surface . However , one could make a guess , given the size of the eggs and the size of the butterfly , at some number above fifty and below a hundred . Nadira and Françoise had now arrived on the scene . Françoise said little , but from what she did say it was obvious - and to me rather curious – that her compassion towards the caterpillars did not extend to the equally suffering butterfly . 111 While we were still watching rather unhappily , since it was impossible to escape from the area of grief and it affected us with memories and foreboding , even though we knew it was nothing to do with us except as fellow animals , something else happened . Three other butterflies swooped down in their blinding zigzags , giving out signs of intense disturbance . I wondered whether they were being able to reach their dying friend , who had now almost ceased to lay , with any sort of help ; if so it was impossible to pick up its nature , which may well have been of an intellectual rather than emotionally compassionate kind , not as it were '
41670	41952	42647	42647	Françoise	125	' us but out of our focus . I thought I sensed a difference in the tide of grief , a change of attitude almost ; it was not easy to get it straight , however , because I had become occupied in deep and irrational grieving for the death of my own father a most illogical thing to do which in the ordinary way would never have occurred , since I was proud and happy about my father who had chosen to undertake an interesting and successful piece of work of a kind which was incompatible with the continuation of human life . But now his remembered face was a centre of grief . Then , equally strongly , I remembered my mother , and imagined with terrible vividness how she might have felt about me , her child – always , to her , her little , loved child – in the moments before her ship burst open and all in it exploded into the enormous , lonely emptiness between the galaxies . As I thought of them both , I could feel tears running down my face , and saw that Olga , of all people , was equally affected . She told me afterwards how she too had thought of her dead mother – her father , an administrator , was still alive . When I had extricated myself from this strange personal shadow , I was suddenly aware of a change in the dying butterfly , which seemed to be in contact with the others , since its antennae were raised . The grief was changing in character , etherealising perhaps . Then Françoise cried out , '
41955	42645	42660	42660	She	125	' and we saw that an attack was going on upon the most recently laid eggs . This seemed to be of the physical type which Olga and I had experienced when picking flowers . The semi - transparent egg capsules shrivelled as though in intense heat . With some 112 - difficulty I reached across the algal bed , not sure how deep it was here , and picked one up . The contact was momentarily stinging , but I brought it and a few others back . There were plenty of anatomical and biochemical data which we still needed . Then Françoise shook herself angrily ; the butterflies had apparently recognised her and were assailing her with blame - this was what came of defending the wallowings of the caterpillars ! Immediately she got into a fierce feeling - entanglement with them , contrary to our whole ethic of non - interference which she , of course , like all the rest of us , had agreed to wholeheartedly before coming on the expedition . Luckily she and they were both too agitated , for different reasons , to be able to communicate . Also , and equally of course , I managed to do some jamming , not wanting trouble . But how stupid it all was ! And , partly no doubt because of the way the cloud of grief was affecting Françoise , I guessed – and on questioning her later it turned out to be correct - that it had set her off on thinking about her damaged and miserable caterpillars . Her children . She had not yet had any babies of her own . Then suddenly the grief was switched off . I began to feel in balance again . The butterfly had died . It was very curious : the colours in its wings became blurred , static and in an odd way ugly , like a badly designed carpet or curtain . Nor was there the same subtlety in the tints and shades . We all felt a kind of embarrassment , especially as we hoped to be allowed to take away the body . But would we be able to do so ? The butterflies which were now zigzagging above us were not those we had communicated with before , and did not seem able to pick up anything about our intentions from me or the others . However , in a short time the predominantly red butterfly , with which we had developed communication to something approaching speech level , came to join the first three . We managed to explain that we would like to take the dead body of their friend back to our camp . It had the most unforeseen effect . The butterflies flew into a passion of anger and resentment , and after a moment I was able to arrive at the fact that they were identifying us with the wood crabs . It was no use getting upset , of course ; I tried to convey that a a 113 it was out of admiration for the beauty of the butterfly that we had been moved to make the request , but perhaps I could not entirely keep out the scientific interest . At any rate , the answer was that we wanted to absorb it , to take it into ourselves , in fact , to eat it , and they could not allow this . It was hideous and horrible . This butterfly , it seemed , was not thought of as they had thought of the emergents whom they had so casually blasted and left to be eaten . This was one of themselves struck by a doom which perhaps they themselves would not escape . This butterfly had danced over blossoms in their own perfection . It was part of themselves . Reluctantly we had to acquiesce and watch them lift and take away a whole body of unsolved problems to some destination which we could not guess at . The caterpillars get eaten by wood crabs ! '

44833	44904	44908	44908	I	0	' I think we had better ask this one whether , in fact , it considers itself to be immortal , if so on what evidence . How long it has been in this state .

44918	44954	44961	44961	Françoise	125	' Look , Françoise , whether we think all this is right or wrong , we ca n't alter it . We ca n't even try to alter it . We shall be leaving soon . '

45277	45442	45228	45228	her	114	' memories . This one apparently remembered an earlier stage of development , clearly , however , as a butterfly only . It looked forward to further development , but we were completely baffled as to what this might be ; perhaps there might even be intellectual states which were far beyond our own . Occasionally we got a hint of this , and I , at least , became fairly certain that the communicated happiness was only one part of the state in which the butterfly was ; we could pick up the emotion but not the detailed intellectual state nor the whole of the aesthetic state . There were certainly other butterflies developed in the same way , and becoming increasingly developed . No they did not end . They did not disappear . The predominantly red butterfly , which was trying to assist communication , kept on , also , communicating itself . We gathered that qualities might be developed in the '
45444	46362	45228	45228	her	114	' butterfly by being with these others . Yet a time might come when they must go . It would want them to go . We asked as tactfully as we could if the red butterfly might become the same ? It became desperately agitated and we sensed that it was possible but not likely . More probably , far more probably , because of something that had happened otherwhere , a doom would fall . The butterfly was terribly reluctant to communicate the fact that the caterpillar out of which it had developed , might have committed some action which would stop perfection - might , in fact , have become fertilised , in which case this butterfly too would , some day , perhaps suddenly , know that it must lay , and that the hated eggs would destroy it . We realised , of course , that probably a simple cytological examination would make this clear . But the butterflies had always avoided physical contact with us , and we did not think it at all possible that we could even get blood samples . They avoided direct physical contact with the caterpillars , and it seemed as though their contact with the emergents was some- 120 thing demanding a tremendous effort . Miss Hayes as well as myself had watched some of the hatchings . At least one in four appeared to be mutilated in some way , and was destroyed . She called us in and we managed to move one or two bodies into the camp before the wood crabs got them , and to make some anatomical and cytological observations . It appeared that there was a clustering of the cells which had undergone mitosis , so that , in time , something approaching a fertilised ovary might develop . But the anatomy was still rather uncertain , as though full differentiation had not yet taken place , except in the external organs , the wing , legs and claws , eyes and so on . There seemed to be the beginnings of organs in the head region which we were uncertain about . Probably they had something to do with communication . There appeared to be a nervous connection with the antennae . If once we could get an adult butterfly in which complete development had taken place ! There were a good many questions still to be answered about this world . These would be for future explorers . We had accumulated enough answers for a preliminary expedition . One must never do too much without taking time to think things over . Meanwhile it was clear that the butterflies themselves considered that certain of their number were undying : and that the states in which they existed and would still further exist in the course of their development , were of such a kind as to justify anything which was done to make them attainable . In fact , there was never any sense , among the butterflies , that what was done to the caterpillars needed justification . It was an obvious process . As obvious , say , as the melting of ore to make steel or the grinding of wheat grains to make bread . We could not convey to them any sense of compassion , as humans know it , at any rate not to larval forms . It seemed to me that what they had shown to the laying and dying butterfly was a type of compassion , though not perhaps a human one . After all this , it was clear to me that we could not intervene on behalf of the caterpillars . At the end of a prolonged discussion I thought it was equally clear to Françoise and Nadira . 121 10 We had now definitely fixed our leaving date . Miss Hayes had been through all the calculations , checking in every detail with the navigators . She did it all with that meticulous care and complete confidence of hers which gave me , at least , such a sense of reassurance . Peder was the same , and so bad Von Braun been in his time . None of the great leaders trusts to the unwavering accuracy of machines , everything was checked . As always , there was a certain amount of discarding of material to decide on , as well as some deliberate committing to memory . We thought that we had , by now , all the information we were likely to get about this world , or at least the portion of it which we knew , and especially about the butterflies and caterpillars and their patterns of life ; I was sure that this would be of major interest when we got back , and I was , on the whole , satisfied with the way we had handled it and my own solutions of the problems of communication . Further expeditions , after further thought and discussion about just these problems , might get communications a stage clearer ; there were several of my colleagues whom I wanted to talk it all over with . I felt that it would particularly interest Vly . Again , a landing on some other part of this planet , or further exploration with some adequate means of transport , might disclose other patterns ; we had very little idea of whether the butterflies 122 were '
46364	46683	46794	46794	Nadira	126	' . They seemed to assume that they were , but we could not be sure . I noticed that Nadira was worried , and a little forgetful at a time when forgetfulness , ordinarily excusable , might have dangerous consequences . Françoise appeared to be acting with complete self - control , but at last Nadira told me that she was anxious . Françoise had been encouraging the young caterpillars to pattern - making activity ; I knew that , and , though I deplored it , partly for their sake , since it might mean that they were destroyed as emergents , yet she was not really interfering in an active sense with the life of another planet . But Nadira said that she believed Françoise was also communicating with the butterflies , telling them that these special individuals , by whom they set so much store , did not live for ever . The only immortality was in egg - laying and the continuation of life through the larval form ; she was in fact trying to undermine their confidence , in order that they should respect their larvae . I was worried . This was definite interference . If the butterflies were right about the effects of the pattern - making and the wallowing , and if they were discouraged about their own life sufficiently to let the caterpillars alone to universal enjoyment of their patterns , then it was possible that a whole generation of malformed butterflies might emerge , crippled in the chrysalis , unable to be part of a butterfly life . Even if they were not blasted , could they survive ? Would they not be victims for the wood crabs ? Françoise refused to believe that pattern - making had definitely been proved to have anything to do with wing formation , and indeed , we only had the butterflies '
46783	46793	46794	46794	Nadira	126	' And Françoise – she is so angry inside , '
46798	46826	46831	46831	I	0	' I can not reach her . She has gone past compassion 123 into anger ; that is so , I think . And anger is bad . '

47109	47122	47123	47123	They	717	' said Miss Hayes , and her mouth momentarily softened in memory . ‘
47128	47159	47223	47223	she	114	' Françoise said . “ Possibly they do not wear out , get no diseases and have no natural enemies . But they can be killed . I killed it . '
47219	47222	47233	47233	Françoise	125	' How ? '
47226	47232	47233	47233	Françoise	125	' I took my weapon , '
47237	47250	47279	47279	Françoise	125	‘ Only to be used for defence in the very last resort , '
47265	47278	47279	47279	Françoise	125	' I was defending them – and ourselves – from a lie , '
47282	47291	47356	47356	Françoise	125	' You know that you have committed interference , '
47347	47355	47356	47356	Françoise	125	' It was necessary to tell you , '
47359	47393	47404	47405	Miss Hayes	114	' because this may alter the attitude of the butterflies ; as it was meant to do . That was my only intention . And it must be reported to the next observers . '
47394	47403	47408	47408	Françoise	125	‘ Of whom you will not be one , '
47411	47415	47416	47416	Nadira	126	' I know . '
47422	47444	47416	47416	Nadira	126	' Oh , Françoise , why did you not tell me ? We might have thought – of some other way - '
47452	49248	49301	49301	Françoise	125	' Françoise said . Well , it was all quite straightforward . Such things do occur occasionally on expeditions . Some member , often one in whom empathy with the new kind of life is most strongly developed , interferes . The penalty , of course , is imprisonment for life on Terra . Beautiful , dull , safe old Terra . To be , as it were , wingless in the Galaxy . Prisoners of time . Françoise knew . She did not try to get out of it after the landing and the report . Very occasionally an explorer has made the attempt to get away with not telling , but this is so contrary to all modern ethical standards and behaviour patterns that it always throws those who have tried it into a state of mental block . What they have hidden has then to be dug out of them , with all the resulting unpleasantness . Better to be like Françoise : to accept the crime and its punishment at the same time . And to reorientate oneself to some other way of living , as she is doing now . Probably she will decide to have a lot of children . Yes , that was what she intended to do when we saw her last , Peder and I. But how will it work out ? She had an explorer 's psychological make - up and sympathies . Her curiosities have all been enlarged extra - terrestrially through deep - layer educa- 125 tion . I can not imagine that she will want to have fathers for her children who are anything but explorers , or possibly administrators . Even the Ministry men do some space travel . They will go off for years of her Terran time , spending most of it in blackout , but she will be ageing . When they come back she will be old and worn . She will have been worrying , as one does not worry on an expedition , when the whole of one 's mental and psychological resources are necessarily directed in one way . This worry will show . There will be embarrassments and miseries . Françoise thinks still that she can face all that and deal with it , but will she be able ? And her children ? She can never be the ageless , beautiful person – but was she really beautiful or is it just my memory ? – that my own mother was . The days of taking personal photographs are over except among adolescents ; she comes into a number of demonstration films , but there she is always working , not looking at one as I remember her looking and smiling . So how will Françoise seem ? By the time her children are adolescents , she will be old . They will feel she is far off , in some impossibly distant group . She will have nothing to help them with . Nadira and Olga - even I , her senior and teacher will still be reasonably young , able to do things and take in new ideas , but she will be old . It will be difficult for us to talk to her . An aged explorer has so much experience , has seen and had to think about so much that he or she is as impressive as the great religious and political buildings of the Terran and Martian past , many angled , lovingly decorated , full of spaces for intense and special uses . Peder is like that ; one can explore him endlessly , always learning something new . But Françoise can never have the experience which will make her old age into that kind of state ; she will not have the extra time to get her experiences into order . For one can take consideration of data as well as pure meditation into time blackout and it will fall into order , will crystallise , will show its essential form , while the somatic frame of the considering mind is at complete rest , not ageing . All this is something Françoise will never know . I have taken her back into my communications research 126 group for the moment , and everyone has been very welcoming , not showing blame , knowing that one punishment is enough . I just wonder how it will work out . When other members are away for five or ten of her years , taking turns , she will always be plodding along . She tells me that she thinks she will be able to avoid resentment of the rest of us . But for how long ? I ca n't believe that Françoise will ever make friends with the non - exploring Terrans . She will have the ordinary contact with them that we all have . There are plenty of common subjects , some quite pleasing and up to a point interesting . There is some research and technical work , and of course there are common amusements and games up to a point . But sooner or later one finds these lightweight common interests coming to an end ; the non - explorers are pointed in another direction , are mostly interested in power and pleasure which the rest of us can not help considering to be of a rather worthless kind . Will there be anything deep for Françoise to share ? Probably she will go on hallucinogen jags with some of them , but that usually ends by having unfortunate effects . If she had the training and psychological make - up for it , she might have worked with the back - time explorers . What they are doing can be most fascinating and genuine research work , whether on our own planet or others . But if she had been going to do that she would have had to make her choice much earlier . The best of them make it , and condition themselves for it from early childhood . Oddly enough , I have the idea that my girl , Lil - burn , T'o 's child – and oh so pretty ! – is quite possibly going to do that . Several of her age - group seem deeply interested , and have had a few preliminary back - time experiences . Sometimes I wonder if it has anything to do with her name . I wanted her to have one of those delicious polysyllabic African names , but To begged me to call her by one of the old names the names of the Changers ; like my own . I remember saying to him that there had been plenty of African Changers , but he 'd set his heart on one of the others and I could n't bear not to let him have his way . So when , later , I told Lil about her name , she dug into the history and got an apercu , which made me think that this would perhaps be her territory . 127 Just now she is working hard at Galactic history , not letting herself be deflected . But it is too late for Françoise to make the personality modifications which she would have had to be making during her early years of education and play . Nor am I quite sure how the back - time groups would look at someone who had committed interference . They might think she was too much of a psychological risk . In back - time research one has to isolate oneself entirely from the scene observed , or so I understand . No , Françoise made herself into an explorer and a communications expert , and it is within that framework that she must continue her life . There are , of course , still a few Terran species which appear to have intelligence , but with which we have not yet established communications . Françoise will be able to work on them . Oh yes , she is not quite cut off from the rest of us . But as the years go by we shall get more and more sorry for her , and I am afraid she will not care for that . And sometimes I wonder whether her interference was really so much worse than the interference we all commit when we go to other worlds merely by being there , by standing and staring , by collecting information . When the early space travellers from other advanced worlds came first to Terra , we felt that we were being interfered with , simply because they were there , observing . We felt this so violently , if you remember , that we attempted to get rid of them , even with violence and always with great psychological disturbance . We have learnt better , of course , but only through experience . Non - interference as normally interpreted is a very coarse measure . We are always interfering , and it seems hard that this particular interference by Françoise should carry so heavy a penalty . I asked Miss Hayes what she thought . I remember she shook her head and asked me to think back quietly into that area of peace and joy beyond our experience or understanding which , because of human compassion and interference , was wiped out . And that is true . And if the penalty was not enforced where would we stop , we Terrans who in the course of history have so often not stopped in time ? Perhaps in another dozen generations or so we shall get to the point where we feel it is wrong to commit even the interference of 128 being in an alien world . Which would mean the end of space travel . Or would it ? Could we perhaps become totally imperceptible ? But we can not see that far and it would be dull if we could . Meanwhile , the interesting point is whether what Françoise did had any effect on the butterflies : whether it was such a blow to their beliefs , their pattern of life , that they made some kind of change in their behaviour : if so , whether this has lasted or has died out , the death of the immortal being in some manner explained away or made into something corresponding to poetry or music : whether it has resulted in more or less cruelty to the caterpillars : whether it will have any effect on the butterflies '

51316	52060	52063	52063	batrachians	790	‘ maternal feelings , was looked on as a nuisance ( again the communication expert was definite ) and was , sooner or later , rubbed off . Occasionally it held on , but never seemed to grow to full size . Sometimes those which had been rubbed off died , but sometimes they would get another chance and be snapped into by a female . If they died they deliquesced rapidly . All this to some extent benefited the Diners , since if all their fertilised eggs had been able to hatch into little Diners , the whole planet would have been eaten flat ; there would have been far too many , and there were no very efficient predators . There were other possible benefits . What value can one attach to the kind of enjoyment the female Diners got out of their grafts ? That is more questionable , though I think one must attach some value to it . They seemed also to grieve at their loss when , at 134 the time of fertilisation , the grafts dropped off , or at any rate they got a sense that all was not well ; but this grief was not nearly so strong as their enjoyment before . How it could all have evolved was very difficult indeed to understand . But it did throw a good deal of light on what had happened to us and our grafts . We were mammals , and that had altered the cycle . But it showed that the females among us behaved in certain ways like the female Diners . It also explained the curious urge which some of us had towards water . It also tentatively suggested that if , as a general rule , the grafts were left on the Terran host or apart from the host for much longer than their normal life cycle they disintegrated and , as individuals , died as they would have in their home planet . Nor had they any chance of continuing as they did before . Sometimes this disintegration could be put off for a time as it occasionally had been with the animal grafts , but it was quite uncertain why or when this would happen . It might well have been something to do with the change in diet when they were grafted on to carnivores . Again it was possible that when they were re - grown , as ours had been in laboratory conditions , from excised pseudopodia , it might count as a new life . Pete thought , but could n't be sure , that the graft attachment only began to narrow into the typical neck that there had been between me and Ariel , for instance , immediately before disintegration , happening very quickly , not slowly as with us . This was only one of the loose ends . There were others . But obviously further research was necessary . It was clear why the original expedition which had brought the first grafts or pieces of graft back with them supposed they were dealing with something well below the level of consciousness . If the grafts partook of the nature of their mother Diners , they were just not bright . The grafts could not go one better than their hosts . But what would happen if a graft which had been part of an intelligent being was taken back to the home world ? Perhaps only interference and unhappiness . One of the first things we decided was that we must try some large reptilian , or at any rate egg - laying , hosts , difficult as it might be to explain to them just what was happening . We 135 thought of the great turtles or the large komodo lizards . Not very bright either ! We thought of crocodiles or alligators , but large crocodiles are singularly unaccommodating , however carefully one tries to condition them ; as laboratory animals their genes are just not suitable . But at least we would know if something near the normal life cycle could be repeated in Terran conditions , and we might find out whether the stimulus for disintegration was simply the presence of water or something else in the maternal bloodstream . It might be that some reptilian eggs might respond to the deliquesced grafts and re - grow individuals . '
52065	52194	52204	52204	you	791	' someone asked . It was clear that there were no Terran frogs or toads large enough to take grafts , but the freshly fertilised eggs might be mixed into the water at the critical moment . Then one of the Martians suggested one of their own egg - laying aquatic types . It had never been imported on to Terra , but we knew more or less what it was : something of a pest in the canals , and we would have to be careful not to let any loose on our own planet or the Police crowd would be after us . On film it looked very like a larger version of the common toad , a real old Bufo . I said to Pete : '

But somehow it did n't set up the old tingle . The funny thing was that I did n't think at all about Ket . I kept thinking about Peder whom I 'd spoken to long distance but had not seen yet . Was I getting monandrous ? Surely I was n't that aged ! I found myself rather upset and shocked , then thought no , it was just ever so simply that Peder was more interesting than all the rest put together . And if only he would agree to it we would have another baby , a daughter , a cornsilk - haired daughter . But that was n't what I was here to think about . " Well , '
52381	52448	52477	52477	We	793	' I think we 've got to repeat the experiment .

52999	54242	52986	52986	Mary	96	' But I was n't having any . At the moment it bored me whether with Ket or his father . I was only anxious to get on as soon as possible with the new grafting experiments . 138 12 I had to see Peder first , so I rushed back . It is still wild in the mountains , still full of echoes and silence ; I slowed down after Trondhjem . It is so good to change travel pace , it is almost a time change . He came to meet me . So did Jon and Viola . Suddenly I felt a shedding of some residual blame that had stayed with me from the butterflies , and also , of course , from having been deputy leader on an expedition where someone committed interference . In fact , neither Miss Hayes nor I had been blamed for this , but one can not help it when an event begins to set up rings of consequences . Jon had been a small boy when I left , well integrated into his group , with a good all - round intelligence . He was almost full grown now , long - legged with a fair skin that burned red . Peder must have been just like that , rather shyly affectionate , showing off all the skill and courage that are natural at that age . I kept looking from one to the other ; Peder himself had aged , but not as much as I had thought he might , since he had n't been able to keep out of one amusing little expedition which had cleared up a few points , and had given him a couple of years of time blackout . It was a non - life world with some interesting pseudo - magnetic echo effects which his mathematical sensitivity had finally elucidated , but luckily there was nothing to interest Minerals ! All the time we were talking about it I 139 was looking for signs of age , but could only think that his blue eyes had deepened in his head , and his hair had a more brightly silver wave to it . But it did seem to me that Viola was having difficulties , and that these were my responsibility in so far as they were my recessive genes exposed by not having another parental chromosome coming out in her . She had been growing up happily in her own group , playing the intellectual snap - on television games that were so popular with them . But now , inevitably with my genes , she wanted to explore , and there were difficulties . On the mere matter of size she could not use the standard equipment . Not everybody would be willing to redesign and remake what she would have to handle . Space travel is obviously the most expensive thing we do , though , of course , the most worthwhile . But sometimes we on our side have to argue with the administrators ; she would have to convince people that she was specially worthwhile , and I would have to help her . By now I had a sufficiently good reputation as an expert for any child of mine , especially perhaps an unfathered one , to be taken seriously . It is odd , nowadays , for a parent to have so much responsibility towards a child . If anything , it is likely to be the other way . One does not yearn tenderly , owningly , over one 's children , not at least after the first few months . One treats them as human beings , individuals , with the inalienable right not to be owned , to have their own space and their own time . Even the earthbound , the non - explorers , realise this , dissociating children and guilt . Yet I could not now rid myself of this curious sense of blame . Several times I returned in dreams to the butterflies and more than once to the Epsies and Rounds , though in this dream Peder usually managed to explain it away . Once I dreamed back to the space voyage with Vly . In my dream I made the other decision : to terminate the pregnancy . But I woke with a sense of horror and immensely increased blame . This was no way out of the situation . Whatever genes had determined me to communications had also determined Viola . She knew her theory backwards . She had practised on various Terran species . I watched her getting 140 C in touch with an arctic fox , being allowed to come near , establishing confidence . It was well done . But unhappily the genes had determined other things . Apart from the headaches , which were better , one or two small allergies I have were much worse with her . A normal allergy is fairly easy to deal with ; hers were more difficult . And again she was much attracted to men . This was all very well in the television games which were great courts of flirtation with their own codes . But the men who liked her brilliant image were sometimes less pleased to meet her in the three feet of flesh and blood which the intellect inhabited , even with the exquisitely delicate skin and hair that was half the normal thickness , impossibly silky , so that shining it floated in an entirely elfin way - oh I let myself think crazily and with deep love up there on the snowfield ! We are better than we used to be at respecting and getting on with unaccustomed forms of life . It was not as though my Viola were in any way deformed mentally or physically . But she could not take over the controls , say , of an ordinary machine , so that she was out of a good many pastimes of her age group . Men tended to be kind to her and that sort of kindness is almost the opposite of the sort of thing she wanted . But she was a beautiful skier , which meant that she and Peder saw a lot of one another easily and without his appearing to be too inquisitive or over - anxious about her life . She did not talk to me at once , but suddenly late one evening when we had been talking about cybernetics she burst into tears . For a time I could not tell how much this was because of her difficulties in becoming an explorer and how much was because a particular young man had n't gone as far as she 'd wanted . I was n't used to being in this sort of relation with someone not in my own age group , and I did n't feel I should in any professional sense pry into Viola 's mind . However , I had to make some sensible suggestion , and I asked her if she would like to go to Mars for a conference with Peder ; she could go up country . Vly would fix it . This would mean experiencing a modified time blackout and getting the first feeling of space . I remembered saying to her , '
54259	54756	57419	57419	he	102	' I 141 - talked to her a bit about time blackout as well , remembering how it had seemed when my mother talked to me . There was snow after that , and all of us skiing and the bright glare of the sun making sharp angles and thin planes of dazzle , the same sun for all of our planets , for our Martian fellow explorers and the throbbing brains and wet crawlers of Venus , for the colonists on Saturn and Jupiter – and a tiny spark of light far in the sky for others . I caught up too on all the news : the rather boring administration news with the Health crowd looking out for bacteria mutations or possible invaders from other worlds , and the Defence crowd getting into their temporary nightmares about some other galaxy and the Police crowd reporting lapses and atavisms : occasional colonial difficulties and all that . How various research projects were going on Terra and elsewhere . What was happening in the arts – here one was most closely in touch with some of the non - explorers , the time - bound , getting in their bits of eternity not from time blackout but from the arcing of beauty , and also with one 's own young , who perhaps take the arts more seriously than we explorers do . And gossip , of course , who was where after what , who was having a baby , and so on . Peder told me the 513 had gone off on a small and particularly dangerous expedition , of which all trace had been lost . Even though she had not actually been blamed or accused of allowing interference on the Minerals Expedition , the thought of what had happened had become more and more a burden to her . I felt a share of that ; I might have guessed sooner . If I had not obstinately set myself on the wrong track ! Peder too felt that he should have guessed . And yet it was that expedition which had brought us here , and which was responsible for young Jon . And then it was time to get back into work time and think about the grafts . But Viola seemed pleased about her expedition to Mars ; Peder was arranging it . I was pleased too ; there had been a time when I had felt that Viola was almost bound to find her destiny among non - explorers , but I could n't be sure yet how it would work out so I did n't say too much . I asked her to take Vly some Terran seeds ; the geneticists had 142 a been altering some plants for him . They would probably all be going to heighten the tone of one of his wines and make it still more delicious . Or should I say “ hers '
57414	57418	57419	57419	he	102	' But Mary , '
57422	57450	57412	57412	Pete	102	' if the cycle recapitulates the grafts disappear completely – that 's the end of them . Do you just mean you want your graft to disappear ? '
57451	57458	57462	57462	You	102	‘ Oh no , I said . '
57467	57477	57462	57462	You	102	' And my hand lay caressingly on my graft . '
57499	57892	57911	57911	Pete	102	' How little he knows , I thought , of what kind this fulfilment is ! Yet I could not have put into words what I felt myself to know . I had regressed into a preintellectual state . Then one afternoon when I was lying in a sort of warm haze of longing and scheming , in which plans and possibilities merged into one another , I began to hear a violent din . After a while I realised that Zloin had reached out with her toes and was communicating a question . Reluctantly I replied that it was Kali and Mani . But there was more to it than that . Quite soon , Pete Lorim came in , looking terribly upset , and with one arm bandaged . I felt as if I did n't want to hear , but he made me listen , and then waited while I communicated with Zloin , making sure that she too had taken it in . Apparently both jackals had been taken with the symptoms of coming on heat and had started yelping . This had set off some of the other carnivores , including even poor dear Daisy who is always so ashamed of herself when she finds herself making emotional noises instead of communicating sensibly with those she loves . Their technician , the one who had been on the space journey , 149 who had always got on best with the jackals , and had never for a moment had any fear of them , went along to see if he could quieten them . But when he went into their play yard they both sprang at his throat , knocked him over and bit him savagely , then raced out . They did not , apparently , look for the dog jackal , but he was in another part of the centre , where they probably could not smell him . As the poor technician staggered up , bleeding and screaming , Pete and a couple of others tried to intercept the jackals , who in the ordinary way had found the grafts stopped them from any quick movement . Not now . With the grafts streaming out behind them they galloped to the toad 's pool and plunged in , after tearing open Pete 's forearm . ‘
57896	57909	57911	57911	Pete	102	' I asked , trembling . “ The grafts melted off them , '
57913	57930	57935	57935	I	0	' Just like they did with the Diners . And have probably got inside the jackals . '
57931	57934	57935	57935	I	0	' Yes , '
57942	57945	58014	58014	Pete	102	' Yes . '
58001	58012	58616	58616	I	0	' I 'd get you to talk to the jackals , '
58034	58615	58619	58619	I	0	' Well , well , I thought , perhaps he 's right about that . What Pete did , sensibly enough , was to get hold of Françoise . She 'd been my pupil , and she was very happy to be asked , to be counted as one of us again . I did n't know this till afterwards , but she managed to get through to the jackals . They were terribly upset and miserable , Kali especially ; she was devoted to her technician , and could not even remember what she had done . When Françoise made her lick his blood , which was on her paws and lips , she howled and howled in misery and guilt . Luckily the jackals had not killed their technician , though they had been near doing it ; his right hand had been badly crushed . Meanwhile the dogs , especially Daisy , turned a real barrage of hate and blame on to them . What they had done was temporarily to ruin the whole relation between animals and technicians , something which was of great value on both sides . And then the pseudo - toads began . They had been left free to 150 move into the pool and move they did ; the males clasped the females and fertilised the emerging eggs , the grafts melted away into the water and now it was possible to make a whole series of biochemical and cytological observations of great interest . These were the basis , of course , of Pete Lorim 's prize work . I remember with astonishment that he asked me to come along and look , but I shook my head . In some way , I did n't know how , my own graft was not ready . Or I was not ready . Something was on the verge of happening that could not be hurried . And I suppose I realised that , if I saw and allowed what I had seen to influence me , I might have been thrown back into a normal frame of mind . Then Trude 's turn came . She jumped the fence that a mild young heifer would n't ordinarily have looked at and got at the pool , which by now was heaving with the pseudo - toad eggs . Again two or three people tried to stop her ; she put her head down and charged , knocking Olga head over heels . She got in and rolled about , and her graft deliquesced . It was then that Pete , without telling me , sent for Peder . What happened to the jackals and to Trude was that the grafts entered and made contact with the eggs , including those in the ovarian follicules . This made itself apparent a few days later in violent pain . Mani went into fits and died . Kali and Trude were operated on and the ovaries removed . But with Daisy things went rather differently . She told me about it afterwards when we were all sane again , my poor lively , silk - coated , golden Daisy ! In a way it was all quite simple : there was a dog mastiff wandering about . He was a great ally of Pete , a quiet dignified dog , and suddenly his smell , which she had barely noticed before , became overpowering . '
58622	58630	58634	58634	Daisy	117	' whimpered Daisy while I stroked her . '
58636	58645	58743	58743	herself	125	' I said . “ I wanted too . '
58754	59025	59026	59026	You	862	'm afraid , lying to these frantic females of various species . It was very fortunate that the female hyaena was not one of the first to be influenced . If she had been she would probably have killed her technician . Only the znydgi were completely quiet and unworried . Their grafts had in all cases remained quite small , and oddly inactive considering how playful their hosts were . But that was something I got to know afterwards . While it was going on I heard the noise but paid little attention . Nor did Zloin , who was occupying herself with the kind of mathematical puzzles that for some reason give Martians pleasing and restful surface sensations . I remember how Vly used to do them at different moments in the space voyage . A Martian in normal bisexuality ordinarily does two at once , but Zloin toyed with one at a time slowly . She was withdrawn as I was , waiting . I found movement difficult , and yet I knew when the time càme I would get strength . Then with a rush it all happened . My recollection immediately afterwards was so displeasing that I have almost blotted it out . What I am fairly certain of is that I was completely under the influence of the graft , except that far down , almost smothered , there was still a very small quietly struggling observer . I remember that Peder came , and that this either coincided with , or was the stimulus towards , the fertilisation which the graft was demanding . '
59033	59038	59061	59061	Pete	102	' said Peder afterwards . '
59070	59387	59445	59445	I	0	' And then I was struggling desperately towards the water , and my tiny inside observer was considering that the original plan of bathing part of the body without allowing any possibility of entry by the deliquesced graft was highly unpractical . I was battering at Peder and Pete , Olga and Françoise , and the terrible thing was , I was winning . We ca n't any longer put our full hearts into violent restraint of another human being . Whereas I had ceased to be a civilised scientist . I bit Françoise , my 152 pupil . I hit Pete a crack on his bitten and inflamed arm and he let me go . Only Peder was still holding me , and I was stronger than he was , younger and stronger , and the water was so near and I could smell and almost feel it ! Then Olga cut the neck of the graft , cut into it , into me She did it with a scalpel , very skilfully . But the neck had not dwindled down as the neck between Ariel and me had done I - or it - bled and bled . They were dabbing on dressings and bandaging and holding on and trying to get through to me . I was aware of utter disaster , utter grief , but could not place it . Then someone dug into me with a hypodermic , and I floated off into night and nothing . 153 14 I woke in a room I did n't know , crying . Tears ran into my ears , tickling and wet . What was it all about ? I sank once more . Zloin was in the same room on the bed next to me . How ? Strange , unreadable . Without her graft . Françoise was shaking me , saying : '
59399	59444	60160	60160	Zloin	140	' After a long time I stretched out my hand , felt for her fingers , then rolled over so as to touch the other hand as well . Sadness came at me , loss , disturbance , resentment against Terrans . “ Zloin , '

60541	60548	60574	60574	Zloin	140	' You have drunk our wine , '

60593	60680	60690	60690	she	886	' I answered that Viola was doubtless with her friends , but she would be going to Mars soon . Zloin and I agreed almost too eagerly that these visitings to and fro were an excellent thing . We talked about Vly ; she told me that his or her - child had a beautifully marked skull . Suddenly I thought how much I would like to see Viola again before she left . When Peder came in I asked if he knew where she was . ‘
60685	60689	60690	60690	she	886	' said Peder , '
60696	60703	60705	60705	you	887	' I looked at him stupidly . '

60745	60814	60738	60738	Mary	96	' I did n't know what to say . One does n't expect an adult colleague to behave in this kind of way . Would I have done it myself for Peder ? Suddenly I thought , well , perhaps I would . I began to say something . I did n't know what . He stopped me , swearing softly to himself ; I remember he said : '
60824	60829	60833	60833	Viola	88	' He went on : '

60861	60889	60944	60944	I	0	' he said . “ Possibly – she did n't want to tell you yet . I expect it was just an accident that she told me . '
