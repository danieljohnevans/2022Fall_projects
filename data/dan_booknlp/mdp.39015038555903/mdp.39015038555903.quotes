523	647	498	500	a Jesuit spokesman	746	“ To the best of our knowledge , Father Emilio Sandoz is the sole survivor of the Jesuit mission to Rakhat . Once again , we extend our thanks to the U.N. , to the Contact Consortium and to the Asteroid Mining Division of Ohbayashi Corporation for making the return of Father Sandoz possible . We have no additional information regarding the fate of the Contact Consortium 's crew members ; they are in our prayers . Father Sandoz is too ill to question at this time and his recovery is expected to take months . Until then , there can be no further comment on the Jesuit mission or on the Contact Consortium 's allegations regarding Father Sandoz 's conduct on Rakhat . ”
1147	1157	1158	1159	Johannes Voelker	301	“ Sandoz is well enough to see you now , ”
1163	1169	1158	1159	Johannes Voelker	301	“ Be here by two . "
1328	1339	1310	1311	his superior	770	“ The Father General wishes you to assist Emilio Sandoz . ”
1439	1444	1432	1432	everyone	771	“ Rome , Johnny ! ”
1684	1692	1693	1694	John Candotti	298	“ I'M SORRY TO keep you waiting . ”
1729	1765	1766	1766	He	298	“ The crowd outside is still huge . Do they ever go away ? I 'm John Candotti . The Father General asked me to help you at the hearings . Happy to meet you . ”
1973	1976	1970	1970	Sandoz	291	“ English ? ”
1977	1991	2014	2014	he	298	“ American , Father . Brother Edward is English but I 'm American . ”
1992	1995	1996	1996	Sandoz	291	“ No , ”
2002	2008	1996	1996	Sandoz	291	“ La lengua . English . "
2018	2033	2014	2014	he	298	“ Yes . I speak a little Spanish , if you 'd prefer that . ”
2034	2055	2056	2056	He	291	“ It was Italian , creo . Antes — before , I mean . In the hospital . Sipajsi yo ... ”
2072	2093	2067	2067	himself	291	“ It would help ... if I could hear ... just one language for a while . English is okay . ”
2094	2106	2107	2107	John	298	" Sure . No problem . We 'll stick to English , ”
2122	2170	2116	2116	Sandoz	291	“ I 'll make this a short visit , Father . I just wanted to introduce myself and see how you 're doing . There 's no rush about preparing for the hearings . I 'm sure they can be postponed until you ’re well enough to ... "
2173	2178	2179	2179	Sandoz	291	“ To do what ? "
2237	2243	2226	2226	John	298	“ To explain what happened . ”
2321	2328	2329	2329	Sandoz	291	" I have nothing to say . ”
2334	2342	2329	2329	Sandoz	291	“ I shall withdraw from the Society . ”
2343	2400	2401	2401	John	298	“ Father Sandoz - Father , you ca n't expect the Society to let you walk away without understanding what happened out there . You may not want to face a hearing but whatever happens in here is nothing compared to what they 'll put you through outside , the moment you walk out the door , ”
2405	2423	2401	2401	John	298	“ If we understood , we could help you . Make it easier for you , maybe ? ”
2441	2478	2401	2401	John	298	“ Okay , look . I 'll come back in a few days . When you 're feeling better , right ? Is there anything I can bring you ? Someone I could contact for you ? ”
2479	2482	2329	2329	Sandoz	291	" No . "
2491	2495	2496	2496	John	298	“ Thank you . ”
2649	2664	2665	2665	he	298	“ They 're a handsome race , are n't ΙΟ MARY DORIA RUSSELL they , ”
2683	2698	2665	2665	he	298	“ The ... folks in the picture — friends of yours , I guess ? ”
2782	2785	2786	2786	he	291	“ Colleagues , ”
3020	3035	3036	3036	Giuliani	294	“ All right , out with it . Say what you have to say , ”
3040	3043	3036	3036	Giuliani	294	“ Sandoz . ”
3044	3049	3036	3036	Giuliani	294	“ What about him ? "
3050	3055	3056	3056	Giuliani	294	“ My point exactly . "
3063	3070	3071	3071	Voelker	301	“ People were starting to forget , ”
3074	3094	3071	3071	Voelker	301	“ It might have been better for everyone if Sandoz had been killed along with the rest of them . ”
3098	3104	3105	3105	Giuliani	294	“ Why , Father Voelker , ”
3109	3115	3105	3105	Giuliani	294	“ What an unworthy thought . ”
3202	3221	3194	3194	his	294	“ Emilio and I go back a long time together , Voelker . He 's a good man . ”
3222	3228	3229	3229	Voelker	301	“ He is a whore , ”
3235	3247	3229	3229	Voelker	301	“ He killed a child . He should be in chains . ”
3268	3291	3250	3250	Giuliani	294	“ At least he has the decency to want to leave . Let him gobefore he does more harm to the Society . ”
3300	3350	3351	3351	He	301	“ We are n't going to disavow him . Even if that 's what he wants , it 's wrong . More to the point , it wo n't work . He 's one of Ours , in the eyes of the world if not in his own eyes . ”
3371	3395	3397	3399	the Father General	754	“ And if the media continue to indulge in idle speculation and baseless supposition , we 'll simply call it what it is , ”
3446	3463	3439	3439	Voelker	301	“ I am not Emilio 's judge , Father Voelker , and neither is the press . ”
3854	3866	3867	3868	Peggy Soong	310	" JIMMY , I JUST heard they assigned you a vulture ! ”
3883	3890	3867	3868	Peggy Soong	310	“ Are you going to cooperate ? ”
3961	3976	3977	3977	Peggy	310	“ You cooperate , it 's that much harder for the rest of us , ”
3980	3988	3977	3977	Peggy	310	“ You saw what happened to Jeff . ”
4085	4088	4089	4089	she	310	“ Jimmy , ”
4093	4112	4089	4089	she	310	“ you ca n't duck this . If you 're not for us , you 're against us . ”
4124	4136	4089	4089	she	310	“ If nobody cooperates , they ca n't fire us all . ”
4157	4207	4146	4146	his	309	“ I do n't know , Peggy . I think they could probably replace the whole staff in a couple of weeks . I know a guy from Peru who 'd take my job for half what I 'm making . Jeff got a good recommendation when he left . ”
4208	4226	4118	4118	her	310	“ And he 's still out of work ! Because he gave the vulture everything he had . ”
4227	4241	4146	4146	his	309	“ It wo n't be my decision , Peggy . You know that . ”
4242	4245	4246	4247	Several people	854	“ Bullshit ! ”
4263	4315	4251	4251	She	855	“ You are not a puppet . Everybody knows you 've helped Jeff since he got sacked . But the whole point here is to stop them from sucking us dry , not to minister to the victims after the fact . How many times do I have to explain it ? ”
4369	4382	4383	4383	she	310	“ It will be your decision , to cooperate with the vulture , ”
4387	4404	4383	4383	she	310	“ They can give you the order but you have to decide whether to follow it . ”
4436	4439	4440	4440	Jimmy	312	“ Peggy ! ”
4514	4548	4555	4555	she	310	“ Peggy , give me a chance , okay ? Let me see if there 's a way so everybody wins . Things do n't have to be one way or the other . ”
4549	4554	4555	4555	she	310	“ Sure , Jimmy , ”
4597	4606	4583	4583	he	312	“ Sure , Jim . You do that . ”
5192	5216	5166	5167	the priest	891	“ Take d ' 16 MARY DORIA RUSSELL ve Sunce . middle drawer outta d ' desk , y ' fookin ' tosser . ”
5235	5240	5224	5224	Jimmy	309	“ Fookin ' deadly . ”
5278	5290	5264	5264	Jimmy	309	“ Beer at Claudio 's , 8 P.M. RSVP by 5 , ”
5347	5350	5329	5329	Emilio	291	“ Deadly . ”
5750	5755	5756	5756	Jimmy	309	“ You look tired , ”
5768	5775	5759	5759	Sandoz	291	“ So what else is new ? ”
5776	5783	5784	5784	Jimmy	309	“ You do n't eat enough , ”
5793	5798	5799	5799	Sandoz	291	“ Yes , Mama , ”
5803	5806	5807	5807	Jimmy	309	“ Claudio , ”
5813	5820	5807	5807	Jimmy	309	" get this man a sandwich . ”
5839	5853	5854	5854	Sandoz	291	“ So . You have come all this way to feed me sandwiches ? ”
5900	5915	5886	5886	Rosa	320	“ Somebody 's got to do it . Listen , I got a problem . ”
5916	5934	5861	5861	Jimmy	309	“ Do n't worry , Sparky . I hear you can get shots for it in Lubbock . ”
5935	5939	5940	5940	Jimmy	309	“ De Niro , ”
5958	5978	5947	5947	Emilio	291	“ Shit . Not De Niro ? Wait . Nicholson ! I always get those two guys mixed up . ”
6001	6017	5986	5986	He	291	“ Okay . Be serious for ten seconds . You ever heard of a vulture ? ”
6030	6053	6027	6027	Professorial	326	“ I presume you do not refer to the carrion - eating bird . Yes . I have even worked with one . ”
6054	6058	6059	6059	Quinn	309	“ No kidding , ”
6066	6073	6059	6059	Quinn	309	“ I did n't know that . ”
6074	6086	6087	6087	Sandoz	291	“ There 's a lot you do n't know , kid , ”
6126	6133	6134	6134	he	309	“ You gon na finish that ? ”
6164	6171	6172	6172	Jimmy	309	“ So what was it like ? ”
6175	6257	6172	6172	Jimmy	309	“ Working with the vulture , I mean . They assigned me one at the dish . Do you think I should cooperate ? Peggy will have my guts if I do and the Japs will have 'em if I do n't , so what 's the difference ? Maybe I should go for intellectual immortality and devote my life to the poor , which will include me , after the vulture picks my brains and they dump me at Arecibo . "
6304	6316	6317	6317	Jimmy	309	“ So what do you think ? Should I do it ? ”
6346	6351	6352	6352	he	309	“ You want another ? ”
6374	6438	6362	6362	he	291	“ Hold out for a while . Tell them you want someone good . Until the vulture does you , you still have some leverage . You have something they want , yes ? Once they 've got you stored , they do n't need you . And if a vulture does a poor job on you , you 're immortalized as mediocrity . ”
6462	6467	6451	6453	Edward James Olmos	309	“ Horalé ... ese . "
6468	6473	6456	6458	a pachuco gangster	931	“ Who did you ? ”
6474	6478	6479	6479	Jimmy	309	“ Sofia Mendes . ”
6485	6488	6479	6479	Jimmy	309	“ Latina ? ”
6494	6497	6491	6491	Sandoz	291	“ Remotely . ”
6498	6503	6456	6458	a pachuco gangster	931	“ Was she good ? "
6504	6515	6516	6516	Jimmy	309	“ Yes . Quite . It was an interesting experience . ”
6741	6771	6772	6772	she	863	“ The Old Sod was a backward , Church - ridden Third World country filled with dictatorial , sexually repressed priests sticking their noses into normal people 's bedrooms , ”
6788	6792	6784	6784	Eileen	314	“ culturally Catholic , ”
6890	6919	6920	6920	Rosa	320	“ Lunches all week , okay ? And watch him while he eats , right , Rosa ? Otherwise he 'll give the food away to some kid . ”
6940	6948	6949	6949	Quinn	335	“ I 'll tell you his problem , ”
6954	6988	6949	6949	Quinn	335	" He 's got two - hundred - pound ideas about getting things done , and a hundred and thirty pounds to do it with . He 's gon na make himself sick . ”
7002	7007	7008	7008	he	291	“ Sí , Mamacita , ”
7623	7634	7635	7637	Father Tahad Kesai	339	“ There 's a message from the Provincial for you , ”
7690	7695	7696	7696	he	291	“ Right on schedule , ”
7712	7720	7696	7696	he	291	“ Maybe it 's not a reassignment , ”
7734	7738	7739	7739	Tahad	340	“ Goat shit , ”
7753	7766	7767	7767	Sandoz	291	“ Why wo n't they let you serve out a full assignment ? ”
7847	7869	7870	7870	Tahad	340	“ You 've done good work here , Emilio . It seems crazy to keep pulling you from hill to valley ... ”
7922	7930	7912	7912	Tahad	340	“ Emilio , I do n't understand — ”
7941	7949	7950	7950	Tahad	340	" Emilio , what is so funny ? ”
8027	8041	8043	8043	Sandoz	291	“ I 'm sorry , Tahad , it 's too hard to explain , ”
8067	8079	8043	8043	Sandoz	291	“ It 's the punchline to a three - year joke . ”
8837	8851	8852	8852	Sandoz	291	“ I have nothing to say . I shall withdraw from the Society , "
8859	8867	8852	8852	Sandoz	291	“ I just need a little time . ”
9197	9201	9202	9202	he	291	“ Brother Edward , ”
9206	9228	9202	9202	he	291	“ if you would be so kind as to break some bread into small pieces and then to leave me alone ? ”
9229	9235	9236	9236	Edward	293	“ Of course , sir , ”
9252	9260	9236	9236	Edward	293	“ That was all English , yes ? ”
9261	9273	9202	9202	he	291	“ Yes . And very good English at that , sir . ”
9274	9285	9202	9202	he	291	“ If I mix things , you would tell me . ”
9286	9292	9236	9236	Edward	293	“ Of course , sir . ”
9434	9446	9447	9447	Edward	293	“ It will all come right in the end , sir , ”
9463	9471	9447	9447	Edward	293	" Try to be patient with yourself . ”
9517	9523	9524	9524	he	293	“ If you need anything , ”
9529	9534	9524	9524	he	293	“ I 'm near . ”
9677	9681	9682	9682	he	291	“ Come in , ”
9786	9793	9794	9794	Voelker	301	“ Of course , Dr. Sandoz , ”
9803	9819	9794	9794	Voelker	301	" the Father General would like to hear that you have decided to remain among us ”
9820	9827	9828	9828	Sandoz	291	“ The Father General is kind , ”
9849	9865	9836	9836	He	291	“ I need a little time . I wo n't trouble you longer than necessary . ”
9866	9874	9875	9875	Voelker	301	“ Ah . You see , Candotti ? ”
9882	9904	9905	9905	Voelker	301	“ He is determined . A pity but there are circumstances when a man leaves for the good of the Society , ”
9913	9943	9905	9905	Voelker	301	“ and I shall commend such an honorable decision . Naturally , we will be happy to shelter you until you have fully recovered your strength , Dr. Sandoz . ”
10003	10009	10010	10010	John	298	“ Sit down , Father , ”
10037	10052	10028	10028	He	298	“ Father Voelker , I think Father Sandoz could use some rest . Now . ”
10053	10066	10067	10067	Voelker	301	“ Oh , dear . I have tired you . Forgive me . ”
10076	10082	10067	10067	Voelker	301	“ Voelker 's a jerk , ”
10097	10127	10128	10128	He	298	“ Do n't let him rattle you . You can take all the time you need . It 's not like we 're waiting to rent your room out . ”
10148	10158	10128	10128	He	298	“ Are you okay ? You look a little — ”
10168	10174	10165	10165	he	298	“ Sick to your stomach . ”
10175	10188	10165	10165	he	298	" It 's ... hard . To have so many people around . ”
10189	10194	10195	10195	John	298	“ I can imagine , ”
10205	10227	10200	10200	he	298	“ I 'm sorry . That was a stupid thing to say . I ca n't imagine it , can I ? ”
10236	10241	10200	10200	he	298	“ I hope not . ”
10256	10281	10282	10282	he	298	“ Look , Father , I hope you do n't mind but I was thinking about what might be a help with your hands , ”
10375	10431	10432	10432	Sandoz	291	“ I mean , eventually , a surgeon could probably reconstruct the palms for you but , see , I thought gloves would sort of hold things together , for now . You still wo n't have a lot of dexterity , I suppose , but you might be able to grip things this way . "
10441	10470	10432	10432	Sandoz	291	“ I mean , you could try them . If they do n't work , it 's no big deal . Just a pair of gloves , right ? ”
10471	10475	10476	10476	Sandoz	291	“ Thank you , ”
10574	10582	10583	10583	John	298	“ Now that I think of it , ”
10586	10647	10583	10583	John	298	“ cotton might have been better . It 's okay . If this pair works out , I 'll make another . I 've got an idea for a way to fit a spoon into a little loop here , so it would be easier for you to eat . Sometimes the simplest solution is the best , you know ? ”
10745	10749	10750	10750	Sandoz	291	“ Father Candotti , ”
10762	10777	10750	10750	Sandoz	291	“ if ever I should desire a confessor , I shall call upon you . ”
10796	10802	10803	10803	Sandoz	291	“ Thank you for coming , ”
11766	11775	11776	11776	he	309	“ You 've done it again , Quinn , ”
11797	11805	11806	11807	Masao Yanoguchi	349	“ COME IN , MR . Quinn . ”
11816	11823	11809	11809	Jimmy	309	“ Please , have a seat . ”
11884	11897	11898	11898	Quinn	353	“ Dr. Yanoguchi , I have been thinking about the AI program , ”
11901	11961	11962	11962	Jimmy	309	“ I know my job is pretty mechanical and I understand that it makes good business sense to automate what I do , so I 've begun thinking about going back to school for a Ph.D. , and it occurred to me that you and ISAS might be interested in the topic I hope to use for my thesis . ”
12002	12076	11996	11996	Jimmy	309	“ Well , sir , I would like to attempt a little pilot project , a comparison of an AI astronomy program with the human subject it was based on . I 'd like ISAS to use a first - rate Al analyst to develop the program . Then I 'd do a side - by - side comparison of the program 's data handling with my own , for perhaps two years . ”
12090	12135	12084	12084	Jimmy	309	“ Of course , a year or even six months might be enough , and then I could THE SPARROW 31 work up a grant proposal . I might be able to come back to work here , on grant money , later on . "
12136	12140	12141	12141	Yanoguchi	354	“ Mr. Quinn , ”
12146	12169	12141	12141	Yanoguchi	354	“ it could be argued that the results of such a comparison would be suspect because the subject held back critical information . ”
12170	12271	12272	12272	Yanoguchi	354	“ Yes , that 's true , sir . But that might be true of anyone who resented being the subject of an AI analysis , sir . I 'm sorry , Dr. Yanoguchi , but it 's common knowledge that most people do hope the programs will fail . I think that the use of a really good AI analyst would mitigate the possibility that the subject is holding back . Plus , since I 'd be using the data myself in my thesis research , I 'd have a personal motive to make sure the results were reliable . ”
12286	12391	12392	12392	Jimmy	309	“ It seems to me , sir , that it might be in ISAS 's interests to have some kind of hard comparative data , to judge each Al program , would n't it ? To see if a program misses things that humans pick up ? And if that 's not so , then the Institute can go on using artificial intelligence to eliminate low - level jobs like mine , knowing that it 's truly as competent as the people it was based on . It 's just one more aspect of the system that could be nailed down properly , sir . ”
12402	12447	12392	12392	Jimmy	309	“ Of course , it 's just a little pilot project . If it does n't work out , you 'll only have gambled six months ' extra salary for me . If it comes to something , it would reflect well on Arecibo ... "
12461	12492	12457	12457	Jimmy	309	“ If you have no objection , sir , I wonder if we could get Sofia Mendes to do the analysis . I 've heard she 's very good and — ”
12493	12497	12498	12498	Yanoguchi	349	“ Very expensive , ”
12502	12562	12498	12498	Yanoguchi	349	“ But I have a friend who knows her and he says she might be willing to do the project for the publicity . If her program beats me , her broker could use that to command higher fees . Maybe we could work something out with him . If she wins , ISAS could double the usual fee ? ”
12563	12574	12576	12577	Masao Yanoguchi	349	“ And if she loses , the broker gets nothing ? ”
12820	12824	12825	12825	he	349	“ Mr. Quinn , ”
12831	12837	12825	12825	he	349	“ your subtlety is showing . ”
12846	12855	12856	12856	Yanoguchi	349	“ Nevertheless , this is an interesting proposition , ”
12868	12875	12856	12856	Yanoguchi	349	“ Please put it in writing . ”
13350	13374	13375	13375	she	330	“ Head up , a princely posture . The waist held high above the hips , the arms suavamente articuladas . The breasts , ”
13385	13397	13375	13375	she	330	“ like a bull 's horns but suave , no rígido . ”
13484	13494	13495	13495	she	330	“ As pretty as a vaseful of cut flowers , ”
13799	13827	13828	13828	She	330	“ Good morning , Señorita Mendes . How are you today ? Are you enjoying the weather ? Would you care for some pastry with your coffee ? ”
13855	13864	13865	13865	she	330	“ The gentlemanly Spanish hidalgo act is tasteless , ”
13888	13899	13881	13881	her	330	“ Let 's get on with it , shall we ? ”
14057	14061	14062	14062	she	330	“ Dr. Sandoz , ”
14071	14100	14065	14065	She	330	“ Your superiors are paying a great deal of money to have this analysis done . Do you find it amusing to waste their resources and my time ? ”
14135	14138	14139	14139	he	349	“ Sometimes , ”
14157	14197	14139	14139	he	349	“ I begin with songs . They provide a sort of skeleton grammar for me to flesh out . Songs of longing for future tense , songs of regret for past tense , songs of love for the present . ”
14257	14263	14264	14264	she	330	“ Is n't that interesting , ”
14284	14305	14264	14264	she	330	“ I do the same thing . Have you noticed that lullabies nearly always use a lot of command form ? ”
14413	14424	14425	14425	she	332	“ Are you allowed out of your room at night ? ”
14428	14444	14425	14425	she	332	“ Or do the cute ones like you have a curfew until they 're senile ? ”
14458	14466	14455	14455	his	291	“ What do you have in mind ? ”
14467	14495	14496	14496	she	332	“ Well , I considered suggesting that we shatter our vows and run away to Mexico for a weekend of lust , but I 've got homework , ”
14504	14538	14496	14496	she	332	“ because some sonofabitch Latin prof thinks we should learn ablative way too soon , in my humble opinion , so why do n't you just come over for dinner on Friday night ? ”
14554	14566	14567	14567	he	291	“ Madam . How could I resist an invitation like that ? ”
14574	14581	14567	14567	he	291	“ Will your husband be there ? ”
14582	14597	14598	14598	Anne	332	“ Yes , dammit , but he 's a very liberal and tolerant person , ”
14604	14611	14598	14598	Anne	332	“ And he falls asleep early . ”
14794	14800	14801	14801	Anne	332	“ Dios mío , bacalaitos ! ”
14804	14815	14801	14801	Anne	332	“ And asopao . With tostones . And for dessert — "
14816	14829	14830	14830	Emilio	291	“ Forget the homework , dear lady . Run away with me , ”
14833	14836	14837	14837	she	332	" Tembleque ! ”
14852	14889	14837	14837	she	332	“ A Puerto Rican friend of mine helped with the menu . There 's a wonderful colmado on the west side . You can get yautía , batatas , yuca , amarillos — you name it . ”
14890	14896	14897	14897	Emilio	291	“ You are probably unaware , ”
14906	14955	14897	14897	Emilio	291	“ that there was a seventeenth - century Puerto Rican heretic who claimed that Jesus used the smell of bacalaitos to raise Lazarus from the dead . The bishop had him burned at the stake , but they waited until after dinner and he died a happy man . ”
14976	14980	14981	14981	Sandoz	291	“ Bacardi añejo , ”
14996	14999	15000	15000	Anne	332	“ So , ”
15028	15034	15000	15000	Anne	332	“ What 's celibacy like ? ”
15035	15041	15042	15042	Emilio	291	" It 's a bitch , ”
15090	15135	15052	15052	He	291	" Hello . My name is Emilio and though I ca n't remember it , my unempowered inner child might have been a codependent sex addict , so I rely on abstinence and put my trust in a Higher Power . You 're dripping . ”
15136	15144	15145	15145	Anne	332	“ I am a highly skilled anatomist , ”
15159	15178	15145	15145	Anne	332	“ and I can explain the exact mechanism by which one blows a drink out one 's nose . ”
15179	15186	15187	15187	George	315	“ Do n't call her bluff , ”
15191	15222	15187	15187	George	315	“ She can do it . Have you ever thought about a Twelve Step program for people who talk too much ? You could call it On and On Anon . ”
15227	15232	15233	15233	Anne	332	“ Oh , God , ”
15236	15245	15233	15233	Anne	332	“ The old ones are the best ones . ”
15246	15251	15252	15252	Emilio	291	" Jokes or husbands ? ”
15299	15312	15313	15313	she	332	“ The first time you 're here , you are a guest , ”
15322	15339	15313	15313	she	332	“ After that , my darling , you 're family . Get your own damned beer . ”
15622	15627	15628	15628	he	315	“ Do you run ? ”
15634	15645	15628	15628	he	315	" I went out for cross - country in school . ”
15646	15668	15669	15669	Anne	332	“ Watch out , dear , he 's trying to sucker you . The old fart 's training for a marathon , ”
15681	15726	15669	15669	Anne	332	“ We 're going to have to rebuild his knees if he keeps this nonsense up . On the other hand , if he croaks doing roadwork , I 'm going to be a tastefully rich widow . I believe very sincerely in overinsuring . "
15861	15867	15868	15868	she	332	“ I enjoy the violence , ”
15877	15911	15868	15868	she	332	“ Would you like me to explain about how that nose thing happens ? The anatomy is really interesting . The epiglottis is like a little toilet bowl seat that covers the larynx — ”
15912	15915	15916	15916	George	315	“ Anne ! ”
15925	15961	15919	15919	She	332	“ Anyway , emergency medicine is great stuff . In the space of an hour sometimes , you get a crushed chest , a gunshot wound to the head and a kid with a rash . ”
15962	15966	15967	15967	Emilio	291	“ No children ? ”
15978	15992	15993	15993	George	315	“ Nope . Turned out , we do n't breed well in captivity , ”
16001	16024	15998	15998	Anne	332	“ Oh , God , Emilio . You 'll love this . We used the rhythm method of birth control for years ! ”
16031	16037	16025	16025	Her	332	“ We thought it worked ! ”
16122	16126	16127	16127	George	315	“ Behave yourselves , ”
16130	16140	16127	16127	George	315	“ I 'm old , but I can shoot . ”
16141	16146	16147	16147	Anne	332	“ Relax , George , ”
16160	16178	16150	16150	her	332	“ I probably flunked the midterm . He 's taking me out to break the news gently . ”
16226	16234	16221	16221	she	332	“ Okay , tell me about her . ”
16247	16253	16221	16221	she	332	“ Is it that obvious ? ”
16254	16257	16258	16258	she	332	“ No , ”
16265	16306	16258	16258	she	332	“ It 's just that I 've seen you with 40 MARY DORIA RUSSELL a gorgeous young woman at the coffee shop on campus a few times , and I put two and two together . So . Tell me ! ”
16407	16427	16404	16404	Anne	332	“ Well , it 's just a guess , but what occurs to me is that she 's Sephardic . ”
16441	16452	16453	16453	He	291	“ Of course . A Jew , of Spanish ancestry . ”
16458	16472	16453	16453	He	291	“ She thinks my ancestors threw her ancestors out of Spain in 1492 . ”
16473	16480	16481	16481	She	332	“ It would explain a lot . ”
16490	16526	16481	16481	She	332	“ Personally , I love the beard , darling , but it does make you look like central casting 's idea of the Grand Inquisitor . You may be pushing a lot of her buttons . ”
16536	16539	16540	16540	he	291	“ Balkan , ”
16547	16554	16540	16540	he	291	“ The accent could be Balkan . ”
16558	16589	16555	16555	Anne	332	“ Maybe . A lot of Sephardim ended up in the Balkans after the expulsion . She might be from Romania or Turkey . Or Bulgaria . Someplace like that . ”
16596	16651	16594	16594	Bosnia	362	“ I 'll tell you something about the Balkans . If people there think they 're going to forget a grudge , they write an epic poem and make the children recite it before bed . You 're up against five hundred years of carefully preserved and very bad memories about imperial Catholic Spain . ”
16667	16676	16677	16677	Anne	332	“ I only wanted to understand her better . ”
16693	16709	16688	16688	Emilio	291	“ The work we are doing is difficult enough . Hostility simply makes it harder . ”
16735	16741	16726	16726	Emilio	291	“ Oh , grow up , ”
16801	16815	16796	16797	A mother	1182	“ Heather ! Bedtime ! I 'm not going to tell you again ! ”
16816	16837	16838	16838	Anne	332	" Heather . Have n't heard that one in years . Probably named after a SO THE SPARROW 41 grandmother . ”
16850	16913	16842	16842	Emilio	291	“ Shit , Emilio , I do n't know — maybe God is as real for you as George and I are for each other ... We were barely twenty when we got married , back before the Earth 's crust cooled . And believe me , nobody gets through forty years together without noticing a few attractive alternatives along the way . ”
16927	16973	16974	16974	she	332	“ Wait . I intend to bestow upon you unsolicited advice , my darling . I know this will sound glib , but do n't pretend you are n't feeling what you feel . That 's how things slide into hell . Feelings are facts , ”
16990	17045	16974	16974	she	332	“ Look straight at 'em and deal with 'em . Work it through , as honestly as you can . If God is anything like a middle - class white chick from the suburbs , which I admit is a long shot , it 's what you do about what you feel that matters . ”
17073	17092	17067	17067	Her	332	“ Maybe God will love you more if you come back to Him with your whole heart later . ”
17136	17147	17132	17132	she	332	“ Hey ! What did I get on the midterm ? ”
17148	17159	17132	17132	she	332	“ Eighty - six . You messed up the ablative . ”
17160	17163	17164	17164	she	332	" Shit ! ”
17290	17300	17301	17303	the older man	1186	" Ten kilometers is nothing to be ashamed of , ”
17408	17448	17405	17405	she	330	“ Just Tas a mo 42 MARY DORIA RUSSELL start in . Pretend you are preparing for assignment to a mission where you 'll use a language you have never studied and for which no formal instruction is available . ”
17525	17528	17529	17529	he	291	“ Beautiful , ”
17533	17537	17529	17529	he	291	“ just beautiful . ”
17560	17564	17557	17557	she	330	“ Thank you . ”
17572	17586	17587	17587	He	291	“ This has been a good project . I enjoyed working with you . ”
17603	17621	17594	17594	she	330	“ What will you do next ? Take your fee and relax on a beach , perhaps ? ”
17630	17640	17641	17641	she	330	“ You really do n't know , do you , ”
17644	17653	17641	17641	she	330	“ A very sheltered life , I suppose . ”
17665	17675	17676	17676	she	330	“ You do n't know the significance of this ? ”
17711	17780	17687	17687	He	291	" I receive only a living stipend . The fee goes to my broker . He contracted my services when I was fifteen . I was educated at his expense and until I repay his investment , it is illegal to employ me directly . I can not remove the identification bracelet . It 's there to protect his interests . I thought such arrangements were common knowledge . ”
17781	17788	17789	17789	he	291	“ This ca n't be legal , ”
17797	17802	17789	17789	he	291	“ This is slavery . ”
17803	17846	17847	17847	She	1191	“ Perhaps intellectual prostitution is nearer the mark . Legally , the arrangement is more like indentured service than slavery , Dr. Sandoz . I am not held for life . When I repay the debt , I am free to go . ”
17861	17872	17852	17852	she	1191	“ And I find the arrangement preferable to physical prostitution . ”
17883	17890	17891	17891	he	291	“ Where will you go next ? ”
17897	17918	17919	17919	He	291	“ The U.S. Army War College . A military history professor is retiring . Good - bye , Dr. Sandoz . ”
18244	18256	18257	18259	one of them	1207	“ There 's no point in trying , as things stand , ”
18262	18287	18257	18259	one of them	1207	" His connective tissue is like a spider web . It 'll hold if you do n't disturb it . Maybe in a year ... "
18515	18530	18531	18532	Vincenzo Giuliani	294	“ Father Voelker has suggested that Emilio might benefit from a retreat , gentlemen , ”
18551	18570	18531	18532	Vincenzo Giuliani	294	“ And he has kindly offered to conduct the Spiritual Exercises . I am interested in your views . ”
18604	18670	18600	18601	Johannes Voelker	301	“ We are taught that we should make no decision in times of desolation . It 's clear that the man is experiencing THE SPARROW S5 a darkness of the soul , and no wonder . Sandoz is spiritually paralyzed , unable to move forward . I recommend a retreat with a director who would help him focus on the task he has before him . ”
18671	18690	18692	18692	John	298	“ Maybe if the guy did n't have people breathing down his neck , he 'd do better , ”
18703	18710	18692	18692	John	298	“ Forgive me , Father General , ”
18730	18753	18722	18722	Voelker	301	“ With respect , the Exercises are a very emotional experience . I do n't think Emilio 's ready for them now . ”
18754	18763	18764	18764	John	298	“ I 'd have to agree with that , ”
18800	18809	18810	18811	Edward Behr	293	“ Strictly from a safety standpoint , however , ”
18814	18836	18810	18811	Edward Behr	293	“ I 'd like to see him elsewhere . He feels as though he 's under siege , here in Rome . ”
18837	18849	18850	18852	the Father General	754	“ Well , in a manner of speaking , he is , ”
18855	18914	18850	18852	the Father General	754	“ I agree with Father Voelker that Emilio must face up to his situation , but now is not the time and Rome is not the place . So . We are agreed that it 's a good idea to take Emilio out of the Residence , even if we have different motives for the move , correct ? ”
18961	18978	18952	18959	all but the most persistent reporters that winter	1224	“ The retreat house north of Naples would provide more privacy than we can guarantee here . "
18979	19000	19001	19002	Edward Behr	293	“ The problem , I should think , is how to get Sandoz out of Number 5 without being detected , ”
19005	19016	19001	19002	Edward Behr	293	“ The bread van wo n't work a second time . ”
19017	19023	19024	19024	Voelker	301	“ Reporters follow every vehicle , ”
19033	19037	19038	19038	he	294	“ The tunnels , ”
19045	19050	19041	19041	Candotti	298	“ I 'm sorry ? ”
19051	19064	19065	19065	Voelker	301	“ We are connected to the Vatican by a complex of tunnels , ”
19069	19080	19065	19065	Voelker	301	“ We can take him out through St. Peter 's . ”
19081	19090	19091	19091	Behr	293	“ Do we still have access to them ? ”
19096	19106	19107	19107	Giuliani	294	“ Yes , if one knows whom to ask , ”
19126	19153	19107	19107	Giuliani	294	“ Until our plans are in place , gentlemen , it is best , perhaps , to say nothing to Emilio . Or to anyone else . ”
19719	19722	19723	19723	Sandoz	291	“ Driver ? ”
19758	19762	19763	19763	John	298	“ Brother Edward , ”
19857	19862	19863	19863	he	298	“ A clean getaway , ”
20157	20169	20170	20170	Edward	293	“ I 'll unpack for you , shall I , sir ? ”
20227	20234	20235	20235	he	293	“ Skip them tonight , sir ? ”
20252	20268	20235	20235	he	293	“ Let me bring you something to eat and then you can get some sleep . ”
20276	20298	20299	20299	He	291	“ ‘ To sleep : perchance to dream . ' No , Edward , sleep is not what I need tonight . ”
20318	20326	20299	20299	He	291	“ Let 's get it over with . ”
20576	20588	20589	20590	Brother Cosimo	372	“ There 's a real wood fire lit in the commons , ”
20603	20617	20589	20590	Brother Cosimo	372	“ Illegal but not likely to be detected out here on the coast . ”
20625	20631	20632	20632	Cosimo	372	“ A brandy , Father ? ”
20820	20823	20877	20877	John	298	“ White Smoke ”
20866	20876	20877	20877	John	298	“ I thought you 'd be asleep by now , ”
20881	20887	20877	20877	John	298	“ Rough trip , huh ? ”
20979	20985	20986	20986	Sandoz	291	“ Do you experience God ? ”
21070	21085	21086	21086	John	298	“ Not directly . Not as a friend or a personality , I suppose . ”
21090	21105	21088	21088	himself	298	“ Not , I think , even ' in a tiny whispering sound . ' ”
21114	21177	21106	21106	He	298	“ I would have to say that I find God in serving His children . For I was hungry and you fed me , I was thirsty and you gave me to drink , I was a stranger and you welcomed me , naked and you clothed me , sick and you cared for me , imprisoned and you came to me . ”
21222	21233	21234	21234	he	291	“ Do n't hope for more than that , John , ”
21237	21244	21234	21234	he	291	“ God will break your heart . ”

23356	23361	23362	23362	Emilio	291	“ He believed you , ”
23373	23386	23387	23387	George	315	“ Oh , he did not ! He knew I was kidding , ”
23396	23403	23404	23404	Anne	332	“ What ? Who believed what ? ”
23416	23434	23435	23435	Emilio	291	“ There 's a dish under that desk , sweetheart . Can you get that for me ? "
23447	23459	23435	23435	Emilio	291	“ One of the kids asked George how old he was — ”
23461	23480	23435	23435	Emilio	291	“ So I told him I was a hundred and sixteen . He knew it was a joke . ”
23481	23493	23435	23435	Emilio	291	“ George , he 's only five ! He believed you . ”
23494	23517	23518	23518	Anne	332	“ Oh , swell . Nice way to get to know people in the neighborhood , George . Lie to their kids ! ”
23669	23673	23667	23673	people with “ little questions , ”	4283	“ little questions , ”
24110	24121	24122	24122	she	332	“ Emilio , what 's happened ? What 's wrong ? ”
24132	24143	24122	24122	she	332	“ Splain when you get here . Hard to talk . ”

24453	24465	24445	24445	he	291	“ I think a rib broke . I heard something crack . ”
24492	24498	24499	24499	she	332	“ Because of the cuts , ”
24512	24524	24499	24499	she	332	“ Can you unbutton your shirt or do you need help ? ”
24603	24611	24599	24599	she	332	“ You 're right about the rib . ”
24700	24716	24682	24682	she	332	“ This is going to need stitches but I can do the rest with bioadhesive . ”
24763	24789	24790	24790	she	332	“ Okay , here 's the hard part . Put your arms up and let me get the ribs wrapped . Yeah , I know , ”
24798	24820	24790	24790	she	332	“ This is going to be wicked for the next week or so . I do n't recommend sneezing anytime soon . ”
24947	24977	24932	24932	she	332	“ You can offer up your suffering tomorrow . Tonight , you 're going to sleep . We 've got about twenty minutes to get you into a bed . ”
25015	25023	25024	25024	she	332	“ Want to tell me about it ? "
25068	25077	25065	25065	Anne	332	“ No . I do n't think so . ”
25078	25081	25082	25082	she	332	“ Well , ”
25095	25133	25082	25082	she	332	“ I 'll assume you did n't get into a fight over a girl in a bar , but I can come up with more lurid explanations if you do n't want to indulge my vulgar curiosity . ”
25134	25142	25143	25143	he	291	“ I went to see my brother , ”
25160	25178	25157	25157	she	332	“ And he said , Welcome back , Emilio , and beat the shit out of you ? ”
25179	25184	25082	25082	she	332	“ Something like that . "
25190	25203	25082	25082	she	332	“ I tried , Anne . I gave it an honest try . ”
25204	25221	25222	25222	They	1406	“ I 'm sure you did , sweetheart . Come on , let 's go home . ”
25298	25301	25302	25302	he	291	“ Sheets ? ”
25315	25324	25325	25325	George	315	" Nobody gives a damn about the sheets , ”
25329	25335	25325	25325	George	315	“ Just get into bed . ”
25451	25464	25465	25465	George	315	“ Do you know what made me fall in love with you ? ”
25483	25534	25535	25535	She	332	“ I heard you laugh , down the hall , just before I got to Spanish class that first day . I could n't see you . I just heard this fabulous laugh , like a whole octave , top to bottom . And I had to hear it again . ”
25573	25582	25583	25583	she	332	“ Let 's live forever , old man , ”
25606	25609	25610	25610	he	315	“ Okay , ”
25614	25632	25610	25610	he	315	“ but only because it 'll really piss off that insurance guy you bought the annuities from . ”
26232	26257	26230	26230	Anne	332	“ Two when you wake up . Two before bed . They wo n't make you groggy . There 's coffee in the kitchen . ”

27881	27923	27877	27877	Jaubert	388	“ I think that the most promising and spirited young people are depressed by the lifelong contracts they are THE SPARROW held to . They burn out , refuse to work . You can see perhaps what a waste this is . ”

28033	28060	28029	28029	Jaubert	388	“ you would be treated if possible and with your consent , naturally , ma cherie . The medical costs are added to the contracted debt . ”

28560	28573	28574	28574	George	315	“ It works just like an old - fashioned TV satellite dish , ”
28609	28646	28647	28647	He	315	“ A radio telescope focuses every radio wave that hits it down toward a central collection point . The signals bounce off the dish to a system of amplifiers and frequency converters suspended above the bowl . ”
28661	28678	28647	28647	He	315	“ From there , the signals travel down to the building that houses the processing equipment . ”
28693	28735	28736	28736	George	315	“ The astronomers use what 's essentially a very fancy spectrometer to analyze the polarization , intensity and duration of the radio waves . Jimmy Quinn can explain how all that works , or you can ask me if you like . ”
28745	28756	28736	28736	George	315	“ Have you ever done anything like this system before ? ”
28757	28760	28761	28761	she	330	“ No , ”
28843	28848	28849	28849	she	330	“ I 'll manage , ”
28875	28904	28853	28853	George	315	“ I 'm sure you will . Listen , if you do n't have any plans next weekend , why not come down to San Juan for dinner ... ”
29169	29177	29153	29153	she	330	“ How 's the weather up there ? ”
29239	29274	29275	29275	He	309	“ There 's a stable configuration near the central engine of the system , with two very powerful jets at right angles to it , throwing off material at half the speed of light . ”
29297	29364	29365	29365	Mendes	330	“ Elizabeth Kingery is a light astronomer who thinks she 's got a new way of finding out if there are two galaxies surrounding two black holes locked in orbit around each other , like this , see ? And she wants to compare the data to quasars , which people think used to be twinned galaxies like 12 - 75 . Are you following this ? ”
29396	29460	29391	29391	Jimmy	309	“ So , the idea is to map this region of the sky using both radio and light astronomy in synchronized observations . The as- 68 MARY DORIA RUSSELL tronomer who originates the request gives the observatories at least two or three times when we can do the work . We have to work around the celestial conditions and the weather on Earth . ”
29461	29468	29381	29381	Emilio	291	“ Why not use orbiting observatories ? ”
29469	29552	29381	29381	Emilio	291	“ Liz does n't have enough funding or clout for access . But you can do a lot with land - based data . So . Anyway , you get a consensus on the schedule and then you hope it does n't rain or something , because that messes things up . Sometimes if there 's a narrow window , we gut it out and do the work even if conditions are bad . Do you want to know about that now ? ”
29553	29564	29391	29391	Jimmy	309	“ Later , please . Just an overview for now . ”
29565	29587	29588	29588	She	330	“ Sure . Let 's see . Once we decide to go ahead , I have to check the noise floor . ”
29592	29662	29588	29588	She	330	“ That means I see if the target region is emitting a signal strong enough to be detected above the background noise . All electrical equipment generates electrical noise - electrons banging around in the metal of the equipment itself . We chill the receivers down in liquid helium to keep them really cold , because cold slows down the movement of the electrons and that reduces the noi — ”
29667	29728	29588	29588	She	330	“ Right . You know that . Okay . If the target signal is really faint , we go around turning stuff off . Computers we are n't using for the shoot , lights , air conditioners , whatever . Then I choose a calibration signal - a known radio source . I shoot that to tune the system up . ”
29729	29742	29391	29391	Jimmy	309	“ How do you choose the calibration target ? Briefly , please . ”
29743	29788	29391	29391	Jimmy	309	“ There 's a huge catalog on - line and we pick one near the target signal . Usually I just look at the signal using a virtual oscilloscope . We know what a signal from a calibration source is supposed to look like . ”
29789	29798	29391	29391	Jimmy	309	“ And if the signal differs from expected ? ”
29812	29824	29825	29825	she	330	“ Mr. Quinn . If the signal differs from the expected ? ”
29835	29920	29921	29921	he	291	“ That 's where the art comes in . Each one of these dishes is essentially handmade . They all have quirks — cabling problems , grounding problems . The weather affects them , the time of day , the ambient noise . You have to get to know a piece of equipment like this . And then when you 've eliminated everything , you have to use your intuition about what could be causing distortions or interference or stray signals . One time , ”
29928	29984	29921	29921	he	291	“ we thought we had an ET signal , extraterrestrial . We got it every few months but nobody else could confirm . THE SPARROW Turned out it was the ignition of this one old school bus and we heard it every time the kids from that school came up here on a field trip . "
29998	30001	30002	30002	he	291	“ Listen , ”
30006	30052	30002	30002	he	291	“ I 'm not just wasting your time telling funny stories . You have to know about stuff like this or your program is going to claim it 's found intelligent life on Mars . And everyone knows there 's only Australians there , right ? ”
30061	30064	30066	30066	Jimmy	309	“ Ah , ”
30069	30078	30066	30066	Jimmy	309	“ I see you 've worked with Australians . ”
30093	30106	30107	30107	she	1559	“ There 's no such thing as beer too warm to drink , ”
30131	30137	30116	30116	Jimmy	309	“ How 's IT GOING ? ”
30174	30183	30184	30184	Sofia	330	“ Slowly . Mr. Quinn is very cooperative , ”
30203	30208	30184	30184	Sofia	330	" but easily distracted . ”
30209	30213	30214	30214	George	315	“ By you , ”
30274	30287	30288	30288	she	1559	“ It makes things difficult . Animosity is easier to deal with , ”
30311	30350	30299	30299	George	315	“ On the other hand , infatuation is preferable to condescension . I appreciate that you treat me as a competent professional , Mr. Edwards . It 's nice to work without being patronized . Or chatted up . ”
30351	30365	30366	30366	George	315	“ Well , I hope this does n't count as chatting you up , ”
30370	30428	30366	30366	George	315	“ but that dinner invitation is still open . What do you say ? ' She had decided , upon reflection , to accept his invitation if he repeated it . People were often hostile to her work and , by extension , to her ; she had not been invited to anyone 's home since childhood . “

30487	30643	30644	30644	George	315	” she said , setting her plate aside and pulling out her notebook . And they went on to business . S umar V re ON SUNDAY , SHE drove to San Juan , allowing time for the dreadful traffic . She parked with difficulty , found a flower stall with ease , and bought a bouquet for Dr. Edwards . She liked Puerto Rico , actually , and had been pleasantly surprised to find how close Spanish and Ladino were . There were spelling differences , divergences in vocabulary , but the basic words and grammar were often identical . She asked the flower vendor the way to the Edwardses ' address and climbed the stairstreet to the shell - pink stucco house she was directed to . The doors to an ironwork balcony overlooking the street were open , as were the windows , and she clearly heard a woman 's voice call , “
30657	30658	30647	30647	you	315	” “
30667	30675	30661	30661	I	0	” She recognized Mr. Edwards 's voice . “
30690	30698	30644	30644	George	315	” A peal of laughter rang out . “
30711	30736	30704	30704	I	0	” Sofia knocked . Anne Edwards , white hair pulled into a messy bun , flour up to her elbows , answered the door . “
30741	30745	30704	30704	I	0	" she cried . “
30766	30771	30764	30764	dear	4138	” Anne Edwards declared . “
30783	30799	30803	30803	her	1568	” Sofia hardly knew how to respond , but George Edwards called from the kitchen , “
30835	30836	30827	30827	she	1568	” “
30859	30870	30852	30852	God	290	” Anne asserted , bustling Sofia into the living room . “
30897	30946	30895	30895	you	315	" They passed through the living room , a pleasing jumble of books and watercolors and prints , with mismatched but comfortable - looking furniture and quite a good Turkish rug . Anne noticed Sofia take it all in and waved her floury hands at the place dispiritedly . “
30982	30983	30984	30984	I	0	” “
30992	30997	30984	30984	I	0	” Sofia said honestly . “

31018	31029	30984	30984	I	0	” Anne cried delightedly . Emilio often did exactly that . “
31048	31098	31099	31099	George	315	” They joined George in the kitchen . He directed Sofia to what Anne called the Kibitzer 's Stool and handed her a glass of wine , which she sipped as George finished slicing vegetables for the salad and Anne went back to whatever it was that involved flour . “
31106	31110	31111	31111	I	0	” Anne explained . “

31172	31188	31165	31166	My mother	1578	” Sofia said , a little startled by the memory of meringue - topped sweets . “
31194	31234	31235	31236	rich lady	1579	” Anne murmured . The menu had been easy and Anne had enjoyed putting it together . Sephardic cuisine was basically Mediterranean — light , sophisticated , emphasizing vegetables and spices . She 'd found a recipe for pandericas , “
31239	31261	31262	31262	You	1580	" served by Sephardim on Rosh Hashanah and other festive occasions . Peach melba , with the cookies , for dessert . “
31282	31316	31275	31275	I	0	” THEY TOOK TURKISH coffees into the living room after dinner , and the conversation turned to music . It was George who noticed Sofia looking at the old piano against the wall . “
31326	31331	31332	31334	The last tenant	1581	” he told her . “
31368	31369	31354	31355	Jimmy Quinn	309	” “
31376	31393	31370	31370	Sofia	330	” Anne asked . It was a simple question . The girl 's hesitation was surprising . “
31413	31418	31405	31405	I	0	” Sofia said finally . "
31431	31518	31424	31424	I	0	” But she could remember . The time of day and the way the sunlight slanted through the window in the music room and her mother nodding and commenting and sitting down to demonstrate a different phrasing ; 72 MARY DORIA RUSSELL as a the cat jumping onto the keyboard only to be dumped unceremoniously onto the carpet , the practice session punctuated by occasional gunfire and the thud of a mortar shell landing somewhere nearby . She could remember everything , if she let herself . “
31526	31527	31519	31519	I	0	” "
31535	31539	31519	31519	I	0	” George said . “
31566	31615	31564	31564	Sofia	330	” Anne urged , glad of some activ ity that might replace the fits and starts of conversation . Sofia was an appreciative but quiet guest , and the dinner was more subdued than Anne was used to or entirely happy with , although it was pleasant enough . “
31637	31638	31519	31519	I	0	” “
31651	31751	31643	31643	I	0	” Sofia pleaded . Her demurrer was dismissed , firmly but kindly , and although she was rusty , pieces came back to her . She lost herself for a few minutes , becoming reacquainted with the instrument , but only for a few minutes . She rose and would have made an excuse to leave , but George reminded her of the peach melba and she decided to stay a bit longer . As they ate dessert , Anne urged her to come back any time to use the piano but knowing Sofia 's attitude , she added , “
31777	31793	31758	31759	Jimmy Quinn	309	” And then , as though it had n't been on her mind all afternoon , “
31810	31811	31812	31813	The linguist	959	” “
31820	31821	31812	31813	The linguist	959	” “
31842	31859	31833	31833	He	291	” George said , and he sketched out the story of their coming to Puerto Rico . “
31866	31880	31860	31860	You	1594	” Sofia said , trying not to sound as horrified as she was . “
31906	31910	31911	31911	I	0	” Anne said . “
31926	31927	31917	31917	I	0	” “
31955	31959	31960	31961	the Jesuits	289	” George admitted , “
31969	32096	31960	31961	the Jesuits	289	” They spoke for a little while about the clinic and the Jesuit Center . But then the talk veered off toward Sofia 's work at the dish , Anne falling uncharacteristically silent as George explained a series of technical proTHE SPARROW 73 cedures to the young woman . There was a lightning brightness to the girl when she was working that made an interesting contrast to a rather appealing awkwardness in social things . Yes , Anne thought , watching them , there it is . Now I see the attraction . LATER THAT NIGHT , in bed , Anne nestled in close to George , who found himself a little breathless . Damn , he thought , I 've got to start running again . “
32110	32117	32118	32119	Lovely girl	1599	” Anne sang . George laughed . “
32121	32192	32118	32119	Lovely girl	1599	” Anne remarked , her mind shifting suddenly to Sofia , who was one of the few women Anne had ever met who merited the word exquisite : tiny and perfect . But so closed . So guarded . She had expected more warmth in a girl who 'd attracted both Emilio and Jimmy . And probably George as well , if Anne was any judge , and she was . “
32213	32220	32209	32209	Jimmy	309	” she added as an afterthought . “
32223	32229	32209	32209	Jimmy	309	” George was almost asleep . “
32251	32255	32249	32249	Jesus	344	” Anne decided , “
32285	32300	32306	32306	Anne	332	” George got up on an elbow and looked at her in the dark . “
32308	32309	32306	32306	Anne	332	” “
32323	32360	32314	32314	I	0	” But neither of them did for a while , each thinking thoughts in the dark . NAPLES : APRIL 2060 John CANDOTTI was awake and dressing when he heard the knock , just after dawn . “
32364	32378	32379	32379	Father	4078	” It was Brother Edward , calling quietly but urgently in the hallway . “
32387	32393	32382	32382	you	4078	” John opened the door . “
32401	32412	32413	32413	I	0	” Behr , rumpled and pudgy , looked almost angry . “
32438	32465	32432	32432	I	0	” Pulling on his sweater , John pushed past Brother Edward and headed for Sandoz 's room , unable to believe the man was n't there . “
32478	32493	32466	32466	I	0	” Edward called behind him , wheezing , as they hurried down the hallway . “
32517	32536	32513	32513	I	0	” John stuck his head into the room anyway and caught the lingering odor of vomit and soap . “
32539	32544	32513	32513	I	0	” he whispered fiercely . “
32571	32572	32565	32565	I	0	” “
32612	32629	32602	32602	he	291	” Edward said , trying to explain his lapse to himself as much as to Candotti . “
32665	32666	32660	32660	I	0	” “
32691	32752	32686	32686	you	1612	” . Trying not to panic , they searched the building , John , for one , halfexpecting to find Sandoz 's body at each turn . He 'd begun to wonder about contacting the Father General , or the police , when it occurred to him that Sandoz was from an island and might be down by the water . “
32758	32873	32874	32875	Brother Edward	293	” he suggested , and they left the main building on its western side . The sun had hardly begun to climb and the stone balcony was still in shadow , as was the shoreline far below . Stunted trees , contorted by the prevailing winds off the Mediterranean , were covered with a gold and green haze , and farmers were already plowing , but the spring had been gray and cold — Vesuvius , everyone said . Anxiety and chill combined and John began to shiver as he leaned over the wall , eyes sweeping the coast . Then , awash with relief , he spotted Sandoz and shouted against the wind , “
32880	32916	32919	32919	him	1614	” Edward , hunched against the cold with round arms crossed over his barrel chest , had headed for the garage to count the bicycles . He heard Candotti 's voice indistinctly and turned back . “
32921	32928	32917	32917	I	0	” John yelled , motioning downward . “
32935	32936	32929	32929	He	1614	” “
32946	32957	32938	32938	I	0	” Edward called on his way back to the balcony . “
32960	32964	32965	32965	I	0	” John yelled . “
32983	33047	33048	33048	Father	298	” Brother Edward trundled off to get three coats . Returning minutes later , he helped John into the biggest one , handed him another to bring to Sandoz and pulled one on himself as John started down the long line of stairs that zigzagged downhill to the Mediterranean . Before he 'd gotten far , Brother Edward stopped him with a shout . “
33053	33106	33107	33107	I	0	” . What an odd thing to say , John thought , wondering for a moment if Brother Edward was concerned about his slipping on the damp stone stairs . Then John remembered the way Sandoz had come at him , that 76 MARY DORIA RUSSELL first day , back in Rome . “
33115	33121	33048	33048	Father	298	” Brother Edward looked doubtful . “
33143	33258	33133	33133	I	0	” But he sounded more sure of that than he was . THE WIND WAS carrying the sound of his footsteps away from Sandoz . Not wanting to startle him , John cleared his throat and made as much noise as he could , scuffling through the gravelly sand . Sandoz did n't turn but he stopped moving and waited near a large stone outcropping , part of the geological formation that had tithed its substance to the ancient buildings on the hill behind them . John stopped as he drew even with the man and looked out over the water himself , watching shorebirds wheel and dip and settle on the gray water . “
33267	33272	33133	33133	I	0	” he declared conversationally . “
33287	33313	33314	33314	You	0	” John 's own face and hands ached with cold . He was shuddering now and did not understand how Sandoz could be so still . “
33336	33354	33326	33326	somebody	4110	" He took a step closer to Sandoz , the jacket held casually in one outstretched hand . “
33366	33367	33360	33360	I	0	” “
33374	33378	33360	33360	I	0	” Sandoz said , “
33385	33714	33360	33360	I	0	” John let his arm drop , the coat brushing the rocky sand , unnoticed . Closer now , he saw that what he had taken for stillness was a coiled tension , wound too tightly to be seen from a distance . Sandoz turned away and reached out toward a line of fist - sized stones placed along the edge of a natural shelf in the rocks , the brace gleaming suddenly as the sunlight came at last over the bluff . His own body tensing in sympathetic concentration , John watched the muscles in Sandoz 's back , outlined by sweat - dampened cloth , knotting convulsively as he worked to bring his fingers around a stone . Sandoz turned back toward the Mediterranean , sparkling now in the morning light , and with the grace of an old ballplayer , cocked and threw . The fingers did not loosen in time and the rock thudded into the sand . Methodically , he went back to the shelf and once again gripped a stone , turned , stanced and threw . When he exhausted his supply of rocks , he went out to collect them again , leaning from the waist , grasping them with his left hand , gasping sometimes with the effort , but releasing them carefully one by one , in a row on the rocky shelf . THE SPARROW Most of the stones , heartbreakingly , were only a few steps from where he stood to throw them . BY THE TIME the sun was overhead , Candotti had discarded his own coat , and he now sat on the beach , watching silently . Brother Edward had joined him and he watched as well , the tears rolling down his plump cheeks drying quickly in the wind off the sea . Around ten o'clock , when the bruises had broken through to frank bleeding , Edward tried to talk to Sandoz . “
33726	33889	33891	33891	Magdalene	374	” The man turned and looked through him as though one of them did not exist , the dark eyes unfathomable . John saw then that there was nothing to do except bear witness , and gently drew Ed away . For two hours more , he and Brother Edward marked the painful progress Sandoz made , his fingers working more consistently for him , the stones beginning to land in the water more often than not , new ones taking their place on the rocky shelf . Finally , he was able to whip off a dozen in sequence , each sinking into the water a good distance beyond the shoreline . Shaking and gray - faced , Sandoz stared out at the sea a moment longer and then walked past the two men who had shared this morning with him . He did not pause or even glance at them as he drew near , but he spoke in passing . “
33893	33897	33898	33898	Lazarus	358	” he said . “
33900	34127	33898	33898	Lazarus	358	” IF VINCENZO GIULIANI was moved by what he witnessed that morning from the balcony , there was no sign of it in his face as he watched the three men make their way along the stone steps leading upward from the beach . Emilio stumbled badly , twice , on the way up . The white heat of anger that had seen him through the dawn had burned down to a dangerous snarling resentment and Giuliani could see him shake off the help he was offered by John Candotti and Brother Edward when he fell . The men below had no idea that the Father General was not in Rome . He had , in fact , preceded them to the Naples house , taking up residence in the room next to the one given to Sandoz , where he waited patiently for the breakdown he was engineering . In the thirteenth century , the Dominicans proposed that the end justifies the means , Giuliani mused . The Jesuits took up that philosophy in their turn but multiplied 78 MARY DORIA RUSSELL the means , doing what seemed necessary in the service of God , for the good of souls . Deception , in the case before him , he deemed justifiable , preferable to a direct approach . So Vincenzo Giuliani had signed the note “
34130	34138	34139	34141	Doctor . ”	4413	” knowing that only Voelker addressed Sandoz as “
34141	34233	34139	34141	Doctor . ”	4413	” Emilio 's reaction tended to confirm the Contact Consortium 's allegations about what had happened on Rakhat . And as Giuliani had gambled , the very idea that Voelker knew was enough to snap Emilio 's brittle self - control . It took almost half an hour for the little party to climb to the top of the cliff . As they approached , the Father General stepped back into the shadows , waiting to speak until they were near enough to be startled by the soft and unexpected words . “
34238	34249	34236	34236	Emilio	291	” Vincenzo Giuliani said in a dry , bored voice , “
34301	34326	34327	34327	I	0	” He saw , without unseemly satisfaction , the fresh anger he had provoked and he continued in the same light , ironic tone . “
34363	34508	34327	34327	I	0	” SU THE MAN USHERED into Giuliani 's office twenty minutes later had indeed been cleaned up , Giuliani observed , but he had not eaten since vomiting the previous evening and had not slept at all , after an exhausting trip out of the city . Sandoz looked waxen , the skin beneath his eyes purplish . And he had put himself through a hellish ordeal this morning . Good , Giuliani thought . He did not invite Sandoz to sit but rather left him standing in the center of the room . Giuliani sat motionless behind the vast desk , outlined by the light from the window at his back , his face unreadable . Aside from the ticking of an ancient clock , there was no sound . When the Father General finally spoke , his voice was quiet and mild . “
34535	34540	34524	34524	Jesuits	1626	” he said quietly . “
34585	34648	34649	34649	We	1627	” He stood and began to circle the room slowly , an old habit from his days as a history professor , but stopped for a moment by the bookcase to select an old volume , which he turned idly over and over in his hands as he spoke , strolling again , placing no special emphasis on any of his words . “
34682	34717	34673	34673	Maimed	1628	” He came to rest now in front of Sandoz , close enough to see the man 's eyes glittering . There was no change in Emilio 's face but the tremor was visible . “
34729	34743	34673	34673	Maimed	1628	” he said very softly , holding Emilio 's eyes with his own , "
34777	34819	34825	34827	the only one	1631	” He had expected the shock of recognition , the look that comes when the truth is spoken . For a moment , Giuliani wondered if he had misjudged . But he saw shame , he was certain , and despair . “
34838	34853	34855	34855	you	1630	” he asked , in tones of wonderment . Sandoz was blinking rapidly now . “
34920	34952	34900	34900	you	1630	” Give the man credit for courage . He did not look away . Giuliani changed tactics . He sat down at the desk once more and picked up a notescreen . “
35018	35081	35010	35010	you	1630	” Emilio 's head snapped up , face carved in wet stone . For an instant , Sandoz looked like a bewildered child , slapped for weeping . It was so brief , so out of expectation , that it almost did n't register . Months later , and for the rest of his life , Vincenzo Giuliani would remember that instant . “
35092	35160	35082	35082	I	0	” the Father General continued matter - offactly , sitting back in his chair and contemplating Sandoz like a master of novices . How strange , to be both a year younger and decades older 80 MARY DORIA RUSSELL than this man . He tossed the notescreen aside and straightened , hands folded on the desk in front of him , a judge about to pass sentence . “
35184	35190	35177	35177	you	1630	” he told Sandoz flatly . “
35295	35310	35277	35277	me	0	” Giuliani said , his voice hardening suddenly as he pronounced each word separately , “
35315	35347	35277	35277	me	0	” And then , mercifully , Vincenzo Giuliani , Father General of the Society of Jesus , took back the awful burden that belonged to him and his predecessors by right . “
35356	35361	35277	35277	me	0	” he told Sandoz , "
35378	35391	35277	35277	me	0	” There was a long moment , but Emilio nodded almost imperceptibly . “
35394	35448	35277	35277	me	0	” Giuliani rose quietly and went to the door of his office . He opened it and was not surprised to see Brother Edward waiting , his anx iety plain . Candotti was seated a little way down the hall , hunched over , hands together between his knees , tense and tired . “
35452	35459	35449	35450	Brother Edward	293	” the Father General said pleasantly , “
35483	35547	35549	35549	yourself	1640	” 10 SAN JUAN , PUERTO RICO : AUGUST 2–3 , 2019 LOOKING BACK ON what happened that warm August night , Anne Edwards always wished she 'd dug out horoscopes for everyone at the dinner . It would have been an excellent test of astrology , she thought . Somewhere , under someone 's sign , there should have been a warning : “
35557	35854	35920	35920	SETI	405	” Emilio , when she asked him over for dinner on Saturday , had suggested with telling casualness that George might invite Jimmy Quinn and Sofia Mendes as well . Sure , Anne agreed , putting misgivings aside . The more , the merrier . Emilio had not seen Sofia since Cleveland , and it was beginning to seem as though he was deliberately avoiding her , which was probably uncomfortably close to the truth . Well , Anne knew what it took to convert attraction to valued friendship and believed Emilio capable of it ; she was willing to provide neutral ground for the task . And Sofia ? An emotional anorexic , Anne diagnosed privately . That , perhaps , along with her beauty , was what drew men . Jimmy had long since confessed to his infatuation , unaware that Sofia'd had a similar effect on Emilio . And George , for that matter . And I 'm in no position to complain , she 82 MARY DORIA RUSSELL mon thought . My God , all this misplaced sexual heat ! The house is going to be flooded with pheromones tonight . So , she decided , locking up the clinic on Saturday afternoon , my job is to make the evening feel like a family gathering , make the kids feel like cousins , maybe . Above all , she understood , it was necessary to avoid treating Emilio and Sofia , or even Jimmy and Sofia , as a couple . Keep it fun , she told herself firmly , and then keep out of it . ON FRIDAY OF that week , Jimmy Quinn had begun explaining to Sofia the portion of his job involving the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence . “
35874	35908	35920	35920	SETI	405	” he told her . Headsets and gloves on , they felt themselves to be sitting in front of an old - fashioned oscilloscope , some VR engineer 's idea of a joke . “
35969	35970	35971	35971	I	0	” “
35985	35989	35971	35971	I	0	” Sofia said . “
36043	36050	36125	36125	SETI	405	” He pulled up an example . “
36077	36097	36125	36125	SETI	405	” he said , making a breathy crackly noise through his teeth . He pulled up a new display . “
36120	36124	36125	36125	SETI	405	” Sofia nodded . “
36188	36189	36180	36182	the SETI tech	1644	” “
36206	36207	36180	36182	the SETI tech	1644	" “
36210	36214	36180	36182	the SETI tech	1644	” THE SPARROW 83 “
36217	36254	36180	36182	the SETI tech	1644	” Stylus raised , flipping up one eyepiece , she settled herself to take in the next load of information . Jimmy took off his headset and gazed at her , until she cleared her throat . “
36267	36275	36256	36256	I	0	” he assured her when she sighed . “
36302	36317	36318	36318	I	0	” It was the first time anyone had asked her about her own methods . “
36383	36384	36375	36375	I	0	” “
36387	36410	36375	36375	I	0	” he said . It was the longest she 'd ever talked . Not exactly a date but sort of a conversation . “
36422	36423	36412	36412	you	1645	” “
36436	36449	36426	36427	Mr. Quinn	353	” Jimmy replaced his headset and dragged himself back to the display . “
36537	36657	36490	36490	they	1647	” Jimmy began working his way through the log , becoming absorbed in the process , talking more to himself than to Sofia . Watching him with one eye , she wondered if men ever figured out that they were more appealing when they were pursuing their own work than when they were pursuing a woman . Slavering was hardly attractive . And yet , she was surprised to recognize , she had begun to like Jimmy Quinn very much . She shook the thought off . There was no place for it in her life and she had no wish to foster whatever fancies he might be nurturing . Sofia Mendes never promised what she could not deliver . “
36662	36680	36490	36490	they	1647	” Jimmy said . Sofia concentrated on the eyepiece image and saw a table - shaped signal . “
36720	36724	36490	36490	they	1647	” He laughed . “
36742	36753	36490	36490	they	1647	” He pointed to the tabletop portion of the signal . “
36762	36771	36490	36490	they	1647	” she said . cre 84 MARY DORIA RUSSELL “
36774	36778	36490	36490	they	1647	” He laughed . “
36814	36818	36490	36490	they	1647	” She nodded . “
36857	36870	36982	36982	I	0	” he said , tracing the tabletop shape with an electronic finger . “
36896	36910	36873	36873	I	0	” He did so . The formerly straight horizontal line now looked jagged . “
36923	36935	36873	36873	I	0	” His voice trailed off . It looked sort of familiar . “
36941	36963	36964	36965	Mr. Quinn	353	” he muttered . Sofia waited a few minutes as Jimmy fiddled with the signal . Triple time , she thought . “
36967	36978	36964	36965	Mr. Quinn	353	” He flipped up an eyepiece to look at her . “
37009	37010	37004	37004	I	0	” “
37013	37031	37004	37004	I	0	” Jimmy said , killing the display , pulling off the VR equipment , and getting up . “
37075	37185	37066	37066	I	0	” h WHEN SOFIA MENDES arrived at the Edwardses ' on Saturday evening , precisely on time and bearing a bottle of Golan Heights cabernet , Jimmy Quinn was already there , wired up and too loud , in stylishly bloused trousers , resplendent in a vividly colored shirt that would have fit Sofia like a bathrobe . She smiled in spite of herself at his patent pleasure in seeing her , thanked him for his compliment to her dress , and then to her hair , and not giving him any time to go further , handed the wine to Mr. Edwards and took shelter in the kitchen . “
37193	37203	37066	37066	I	0	” Dr. Edwards told her , kissing her cheek . “
37244	37402	37237	37238	Father Sandoz	291	” But Sofia heard his voice only ten minutes later , announcing the score , clearly pleased with the result . Greeting George and Jimmy on the run , Sandoz came straight to the kitchen , hair still damp from his THE SPARROW 85 shower , shirttails flying , with flowers for Dr. Edwards , upon whom he bestowed a brief courtly kiss . Obviously at home , he reached past Anne for a vase on one of the shelves , filled it with water and put the flowers into it , arranging them a little before turning from the sink to take them out to the table . Then he saw Sofia , sitting on the stool in the corner , and his eyes warmed while his face remained gravely dignified . Drawing one flower from Anne 's bouquet , he tapped the moisture from it and inclined his head in a short , formal bow . “
37412	37781	37782	37782	Jimmy	309	” he said with exaggerated courtesy , a parody of the Spanish aristocrat who had so offended her before . Familiar now with the squalor of his childhood , she understood the joke this time and , laughing , accepted the flower . He smiled and , his eyes slowly leaving hers , turned to Jimmy , who 'd just come into the kitchen , effectively jamming it with humanity . Anne hollered for everyone to clear out so she could move and Emilio pushed Jimmy back out of the room , picking up the thread of an argument Sofia could n't follow about something they evidently fought over frequently and to no useful purpose . Anne handed her a platter of banderillas and they began ferrying food out to the table . The conversation quickly became general and lively . The meal was good and the wine tasted of cherries . It all contributed to what happened . After dinner , they moved into the living room and Sofia Mendes felt herself relaxing in a way that she had never experienced as an adult . There was a kind of safety here that she found as exotic as a dogwood and as beautiful . She felt that she was wholly welcome , that people in this home were prepared to like her , no matter who she was or what she 'd done . She felt she could tell Anne , or even George , about the days before Jaubert , and that George would forgive her and Anne would say that Sofia had been brave and sensible to do what she had to . As dusk deepened into night , the conversation trailed off and Anne suggested that Jimmy play something , an idea that met with universal approval . He looked like a child looming over a toy piano , Sofia thought , his knees splayed to the outside , almost level with the keys , feet angled in toward the pedals . But he was a graceful and fluid player , his big hands easily dominating the keyboard , and she tried not to be embarrassed as he sang a rather obvious love song . “
37796	37822	37823	37823	George	315	” Anne said in a stage whisper , glancing at Sofia and hoping to change the mood before the boy dug himself in too deeply . “
37839	37843	37823	37823	George	315	” MARY DORIA RUSSELL “
37854	37867	37868	37868	Sofia	330	” George ordered , laughing , waving Jimmy away from the piano . “
37873	37874	37875	37875	You	330	" “
37878	37895	37875	37875	You	330	” Jimmy asked , knocking over the piano bench in his haste to vacate for her . “
37899	37906	37875	37875	You	330	” she said and added honestly , “
37913	37960	37961	37961	I	0	" She began with a small piece by Strauss , not too difficult but pretty . Gaining confidence , she tried some Mozart but got lost in one of the more complicated passages and gave up , despite the encouragement mixed with good - natured razzing . “
37974	38626	37963	37963	I	0	” she said smiling ruefully , turning toward the room . She meant to apologize for her ineptitude after Jimmy 's lovely playing and to yield the instrument to him , but then her eyes fell on Sandoz , sitting in a chair in the corner , at a little distance from the rest of them , withdrawn by choice or by nature or by circumstance . Unclear about her own motives , warmed by the wine and the company , she began something she thought would be familiar to him , a very old Spanish melody . To everyone 's surprise , probably even his own , Emilio left his corner , came to the side of the piano , and began to sing in a clear light tenor . Judging him , Sofia changed keys and then the tempo as well . His eyes narrowed slightly but he started the second verse in the minor key she was using , following her lead . Pleased that he 'd understood her intent , holding his eyes with hers , she began to sing a different song , in counterpoint . She had a grainy contralto and the voices were gorgeous together , despite or perhaps because of the oddity of a male taking the higher notes , and for a little while there was no other sound in the world than the song Emilio Sandoz and Sofia Mendes sang . Jimmy looked sick with envy . Anne moved behind him , bending over the sofa to put her thin , strong arms around his big shoulders and rest her head next to his . When she felt the rigidity give way , she tightened her embrace briefly and let him go , straightening up and standing quietly as the song went on . Ladino , she thought , recognizing elements of Spanish and Hebrew . Sofia 's song was a Sephardic variation on the Spanish tune , perhaps . Anne looked at George and saw him come to his own conclusion , suspecting the outcome , but not from the music , only from a feeling of inevitability about these two people . And then her silent analysis fell away and she listened , trying not to shiver , as the two songs diverged and interwove until , at the very end , the harmony and counterpoint reTHE SPARROW 87 solved : lyrics and melodies and voices coming together , across the centuries , to a single word and note . Tearing her eyes away from Emilio 's face , Anne led the chorus of praise , restoring a fragile equilibrium . Jimmy did his best , but ten minutes later he made excuses about having work to catch up on and , calling out his good - byes , headed for the door . This was the cue for a general exodus , as though all of them needed to put space between themselves and a kind of intimacy no one had planned or anticipated . Anne hesitated , feeling that as hostess she should wait until Emilio and Sofia left as well . But it was taking them a few minutes to get organized , so she covered herself with a plausible excuse and followed Jimmy out the door . He was more than halfway to the plaza when Anne caught up with him in the dark . The neighborhood was quiet , although there were snatches of music coming in with the sea breeze from La Perla , where things went on later . Hearing her footsteps , he turned , and she stopped two stairs upward of him , so she could look him in the eye . It was n't cold but Jimmy was shaking , a gigantic Raggedy Andy doll with his spiraling yarnlike hair , mouth drawn up in his silly crescent smile . “
38636	38656	38628	38628	you	1659	” he joked lamely . Anne did n't dignify that with a reply , but her eyes were compassionate . “
38689	38693	38694	38694	God	290	” he moaned . “
38711	38717	38707	38707	Jesus	344	” he cried out quietly , “
38746	38844	38845	38845	Jesus	344	" Anne stopped him with a finger on his lips . She could think of dozens of things to say : that nobody can make anyone else love them , that half the world 's misery was wanting someone who did n't want you , that unavailability was a powerful aphrodisiac , that Jimmy was a sweet , intelligent , dear man- None of it would help . She joined him on his step , laid her head against his chest and put her arms around him , marveling again at the sheer size of the boy . "
38849	38855	38847	38847	Anne	332	” he whispered above her . “
38866	38867	38847	38847	Anne	332	” “
38877	38882	38847	38847	Anne	332	” she assured him . “
38889	39250	38847	38847	Anne	332	” THAT TIME OF night , it was less than an hour 's drive back to Arecibo . By the time he pulled into the apartment parking lot , Jimmy was done crying and almost past the desire to get drunk , which he 'd reMARY DORIA RUSSELL jected as too dramatic a response to the situation . Sofia had never given him any encouragement . The whole thing had been a fantasy , and that was that . And really , what did he know about Emilio ? Priests were just men , Eileen Quinn had always reminded him when he 'd come home from school full of hero worship and awe . Ordination does n't make you a saint . And anyway , in other religions , priests married and had children . Shit , he thought . It was just a song . I 've got them married , with kids ! It 's none of my business . But he could n't get the sound of them together out of his mind . It was like watching ... Sleep was out of the question . He tried a few pages of the book he was reading but ended up tossing it across the room , unable to concentrate . He rooted around in the cupboards and wished he 'd taken Anne up on her offer when she asked him if he wanted to take some leftovers home with him . Finally , he decided to make good on the excuse he 'd used to leave early and connected with the dish system . He opened the SETI log , picking up where he 'd left off with Sofia on Friday afternoon , deciding to bull his way through the hideously embarrassing prospect of seeing her again by going straight at the topic he 'd cover with her on Monday . AT 3:57 A.M. on Sunday , August 3 , 2019 , James Connor Quinn pulled off his headset and sat back in his chair , sweating and sucking air , sure now , but hardly able to believe what he alone in all his world knew . “
39254	39268	39251	39252	Jesus Christ	344	” Jimmy breathed , meeting the future by turning to the ancient past . “
39274	39316	39269	39272	Holy Mother of God	1669	” He rubbed his eyes and combed his fingers through his tangled , scribbly hair and sat , staring blankly , for a few moments longer . Then he called Anne . 11 ARECIBO , PUERTO RICO : AUGUST 3 , 2019 “
39320	39324	39325	39326	Sweet pea	407	” Anne whispered . “

39385	39412	39380	39380	I	0	” Anne , standing naked in the dark , smiled and sent a mental apology to Mrs. Quinn . She heard Jimmy 's urgent voice again . “
39435	39448	39424	39424	I	0	” Anne did n't say anything , but Jimmy understood her silence . “
39524	39525	39512	39512	Anne	332	” “

39824	39847	39818	39818	We	1680	” She found she could n't add . Her mind just went blank . God . Music . Four light years away . “
39852	39856	39818	39818	We	1680	” Jimmy supplied . “
39867	39868	39865	39865	Anne	332	” “
39887	39888	39877	39877	We	1680	” “

39959	39999	40003	40004	Mr. Edwards	315	” IT WAS A clear chilly morning , the light still pale , when the Edwardses and their passengers pulled in . Jimmy 's little Ford was the only car in the dish parking lot besides the guard 's . “
40006	40014	40003	40004	Mr. Edwards	315	” he asked as they signed in . “
40042	40194	40195	40195	I	0	” George said . Anne , smiling innocently , handed the guard a couple of donuts on the way by . Awake all night , Jimmy was bleary - eyed but too strung up on his nerves to notice he was tired . As they squeezed into his little cubicle , he grabbed the donut Anne held out to him and ate it in two bites , setting up the playback while he chewed . THE SPARROW 91 as ssum It was vocal , mainly . There was a percussive underlayment and possibly wind instruments as well , but it was hard to tell about that — there was still a lot of noise , although Jimmy had already filtered some out . And it was unquestionably alien . The timbre of the voices , the harmonics were simply different , in some way that Jimmy could n't describe in words . “
40212	40217	40195	40195	I	0	” he told them , “
40241	40242	40232	40232	I	0	" “
40256	40262	40251	40251	you	0	” Anne agreed , shrugging . “
40288	40335	40266	40266	you	0	” At first , they simply listened to the fragment of music over and over , each time groaning as the signal fell off to static just as the music began to build to something wonderful . Then , after the third hearing , Anne said , “
40379	40380	40365	40365	we	1680	” “
40395	40399	40365	40365	we	1680	” George said , “
40408	40409	40384	40384	they	1689	” “
40433	40437	40420	40420	they	1689	” Anne listed . “
40454	40458	40439	40439	they	1689	” said Jimmy . “
40468	40472	40439	40439	they	1689	” Emilio said , “
40505	40519	40520	40520	Jimmy	309	” It did n't occur to him to wonder if they had throats . “
40530	40609	40520	40520	Jimmy	309	” Jimmy replayed it . Sitting at the edge of the group , almost in the hallway just beyond Jimmy 's little space , Sofia watched Sandoz , seeing in action the process she had abstracted while working for the Jesuits in Cleveland . He was already beginning to mouth a little of it , picking up phrases sung by the chorus , trying out phonemes . Without a word , she handed him her notebook and stylus . “
40618	40639	40640	40640	Jimmy	309	” he said to no one in particular , distracted , half - convinced already . He began making notes . “
40645	40665	40666	40666	Jim	309	” Jimmy rolled his chair out of the way and let Emilio take the console . 92 MARY DORIA RUSSELL “
40675	40679	40669	40669	you	309	” George asked . “

40733	40744	40730	40730	their	1696	” Jimmy told him . He thought for a while . “

40765	40769	40669	40669	you	309	” George disagreed . “
40798	40831	40843	40843	They	1696	” There was a short pause , everyone chewing on the ideas , the only sound that of the music as Emilio slowed it down and repeated sections , correcting his notes . “
40838	40842	40843	40843	They	1696	” George continued . “
40872	40873	40843	40843	They	1696	” “

40895	40899	40843	40843	They	1696	” Anne suggested . “

40931	40935	40843	40843	They	1696	” Jimmy said . “

40966	40980	40945	40945	You	1697	” George said . He laughed and shook his head , still stunned . “
40996	41008	40945	40945	You	1697	” Sofia raised her brows in question , so George explained . “
41036	41037	41038	41038	My	0	” “
41041	41045	41038	41038	My	0	” Anne sighed , “
41071	41086	41089	41089	you	1704	” Her face changed and she leaned over to hug Emilio with wicked glee . “
41116	41158	41114	41114	Emilio	291	” Emilio , who had played the music again and again , catching more of it each time , finding a pattern or two , suddenly sat very still . But before he could say anything , Anne spoke up again . “
41174	41175	41161	41161	you	1704	” “
41260	41336	41337	41338	Mr. Quinn	353	” The discussion went on for some time , with George , Anne and Jimmy extrapolating , deducing and arguing . Emilio , thoughtful , went back to the music again , playing it through softly once more , but then he turned the playback off . Sofia alone had neither comment on the music itself nor any speculation about the singers , but when the talk finally slowed to a halt , she asked , “
41353	41378	41342	41342	you	353	” In the excitement , Jimmy had forgotten the embarrassment of the previous evening , and now he was feeling too good to care . “
41389	41394	41342	41342	you	353	” he said evenly . “
41438	41439	41430	41430	I	0	” “

41547	41551	41512	41512	you	353	” Jimmy admitted . “
41589	41615	41512	41512	you	353	" He yawned enormously and stood to stretch , which required Anne to duck out of his way and George to move into a corner . “
41676	41677	41662	41662	I	0	” “
41695	41736	41690	41690	my	0	” she said without emotion , but she was twisting the metal bracelet around and around . Triple time . She 'd be perhaps thirty - seven or thirtyeight . Not forever . Hubris , to have made the wager . “

41811	41822	41823	41823	I	0	” Emilio said in the silence that followed her remarks . “
41841	41857	41858	41858	We	1712	” The others looked at him blankly , still thinking about Sofia 's unenviable position . “
41871	41881	41858	41858	We	1712	” he corrected himself , looking directly at Sofia . “
41903	41916	41858	41858	We	1712	” At first , only Sofia saw what he was driving at . “
41919	41932	41858	41858	We	1712	” she said , glad to be distracted by him for once . “
41950	41952	41941	41942	The miners	1203	” . “
41957	41961	41941	41942	The miners	1203	” George said . “

42053	42057	42111	42111	Ohbayashi	412	” Emilio said . “
42061	42065	42111	42111	Ohbayashi	412	” George agreed . “
42071	42075	42067	42067	I	0	” Anne said . “
42078	42091	42092	42092	Sofia	330	” But George was starting to laugh and Emilio looked positively beatific . “
42094	42098	42092	42092	Sofia	330	” George said , “
42107	42108	42104	42104	you	330	” “
42113	42137	42104	42104	you	330	” Sofia finished for him . She looked at Anne and then the others , and gave a small astonished laugh before saying , “
42216	42221	42222	42222	You	330	” she said wryly . “
42240	42268	42226	42227	Dr. Sandoz	291	” Emilio , who had been leaning forward and watching her carefully as she spoke , clapped once and sat back in his chair , smiling broadly . “
42280	42284	42226	42227	Dr. Sandoz	291	” Anne objected . “
42292	42300	42226	42227	Dr. Sandoz	291	” Emilio said . THE SPARROW 95 SC “
42303	42313	42226	42227	Dr. Sandoz	291	” Jimmy said , looking at Sofia and Sandoz . “
42383	42412	42454	42454	you	1728	” he said , starting to think about it now . George gestured for Sofia 's notebook and stylus . Emilio saved his file and handed it over . “
42420	42438	42454	42454	you	1728	” George said , blanking the screen so he could sketch the idea out on the tablet . “
42477	42522	42454	42454	you	1728	" For a while there was no sound except the muttering of numbers and the tapping of a keyboard , Jimmy beginning the calculations on - line as George continued them by hand . George finished his estimate first , to Jimmy 's irritation . “
42536	42547	42454	42454	you	1728	” Emilio looked both crestfallen and startled by the difference . “
42550	42555	42454	42454	you	1728	” George told him , “
42565	42573	42556	42556	Anne	332	” Anne snorted but George went on , "
42633	42645	42654	42655	the crew	1731	” Jimmy continued to work on his own line of calculation . “
42663	42664	42654	42655	the crew	1731	” “
42670	42674	42654	42655	the crew	1731	” Emilio exclaimed . "
42677	42686	42654	42655	the crew	1731	” Jimmy said , staring at the numbers . “
42744	42755	42760	42760	I	0	” he asked himself and went back to the calculations . “
42768	42772	42760	42760	I	0	” Anne said . “

42827	42846	42812	42812	You	1728	” said Emilio , laughing a little crazily . They fell quiet , talked out for the moment . “
42853	42898	42812	42812	You	1728	” nost eight o'clock , and he was beginning to think MARY DORIA RUSSELL about what kind of trouble he could be in for not calling Masao Yanoguchi first . It was Emilio Sandoz , face solemn and eyes alight , who answered him . “
42904	42917	42918	42918	Emilio	291	” he said . There was silence and then Anne laughed uncertainly . “
42949	42950	42943	42943	we	1737	” “
42953	42973	42943	42943	we	1737	” he said simply , with a kind of hilarious gravity that kept the rest of them off balance . “
43004	43005	42978	42978	Jimmy	309	" “
43008	43012	42978	42978	Jimmy	309	” Sofia confirmed . “

43037	43042	43014	43015	Mr. Edwards	315	” George pointed out . “
43051	43055	43045	43045	I	0	” Sofia said . “
43099	43220	43221	43221	I	0	” Her voice trailed off and she looked at Sandoz , as everyone else was . For some reason , he found what she had just said very funny . None of them could have known what he was thinking , how much this reminded him of that evening in Sudan when he read the Provincial 's order sending him to John Carroll . Where he met Sofia . And Anne and George , who found Jimmy . Who brought them all here , now . He ran his hands through the dark , straight hair that had fallen into his eyes and saw them all staring at him .

43247	43396	43221	43221	I	0	” In the next hour , George and Jimmy and Sofia outlined the ideas for him : how wildcatters selected and obtained suitable asteroids and outfitted them with life support , how the engines broke down silicates to use as fuel to move the asteroids to Earth - orbit refineries , how twentyton loads of refined metals were aimed , like the old Gemini capsules , at recovery sites in the ocean off Japan 's coast . How you could scale the system up for long - range travel . Trained as a linguist and a priest , Emilio had a hard time understanding the Einsteinian physics that predicted that the transit time elapsed on Earth would be around seventeen years , while the effect of traveling near light speed would make it seem closer to six months for the crew onboard the asteroid .

43484	43560	43599	43599	You	1741	” Jimmy explained how they could plot the course , and Emilio found that even less intelligible . And then there was the problem of making landfall . There were a lot of loose ends , George and Jimmy and Sofia acknowledged . Even so , it could be done , they thought . Anne listened as closely as Emilio , but she was skeptical to the point of dismissing the whole business as silly . “
43565	43571	43599	43599	You	1741	” she said at last , “

44371	44381	44354	44354	I	0	” Anne said flatly and looked straight at Emilio . “

44634	44635	44630	44630	You	291	” “
44651	44690	44693	44693	Anne	332	" He moved from his corner to her perch on a table behind Jimmy 's terminal , took her hands and went down on one knee , not in an attitude of prayer but with an odd playfulness . “
44747	44751	44737	44737	George	315	” he insisted . “
44809	44817	44804	44804	They	1783	” She felt his hands squeeze hers . “
44850	44937	44938	44938	Anne	332	" She had no reply . She could only look at him , and then at the others , one by one . Sofia , who was knowledgeable and brilliant and who seemed to think there was no insurmountable economic or technical difficulty in launching a mission . Jimmy , who was already working out the astronomical problems . George , whom she loved and trusted and believed in , and who thought they should be part of this . Emilio . Who spoke of God . “
44948	45014	44938	44938	Anne	332	” Emilio pleaded . He looked about seventeen years old to her , a teenager trying to convince his mom that he 'd be fine driving across the country on a motorcycle . But he was not seventeen , and she was not his mother . He was a priest , pushing middle age , and he was alive with something she could hardly imagine . “
45024	45041	45016	45016	me	0	” he said , his voice reasonable . He stood but kept her hands in his . “
45079	45119	45065	45065	We	1785	” Still , she did not reply but he could see her eyes change . Not capitulation but a sort of worried , reluctant assent was forming . A willingness to suspend judgment , perhaps . 100 MARY DORIA RUSSELL “
45126	45131	45120	45120	Someone	4267	” he assured her . “
45146	45401	45402	45402	I	0	” There was a part of Anne Edwards that was thrilled about the discovery , that gloried in being this close to history in the making . And deeper , in a place she rarely inspected , there was a part of her that wanted to believe as Emilio seemed to believe , that God was in the universe , making sense of things . Once , long ago , she 'd allowed herself to think seriously about what human beings would do , confronted directly with a sign of God 's presence in their lives . The Bible , that repository of Western wisdom , was instructive either as myth or as history , she 'd decided . God was at Sinai and within weeks , people were dancing in front of a golden calf . God walked in Jerusalem and days later , folks nailed Him up and then went back to work . Faced with the Divine , people took refuge in the banal , as though answering a cosmic multiple - choice question : If you saw a burning bush , would you ( a ) call 911 , ( b ) get the hot dogs , or ( c ) recognize God ? A vanishingly small number of people would recognize God , Anne had decided years before , and most of them had simply missed a dose of Thorazine . She took her cold hands out of Emilio 's warm ones and crossed her arms over her chest . “
45406	45495	45402	45402	I	0	” she muttered and left the cubicle . 12 EARTH : AUGUST 3–4 , 2019 un AT 9:13 A.M. , Sunday , August 3 , 2019 , the guard at the Arecibo Radio Telescope signed out Jimmy Quinn 's visitors . Leaving his desk for a few minutes to stretch a little , the guard strolled to the front door and returned the waves of George and his passengers . Masao Yanoguchi arrived at Arecibo half an hour later . As he signed in , the guard remarked , “
45506	46391	45500	45500	George	315	” Yanoguchi nodded pleasantly but headed directly for Jimmy Quinn 's cubicle . By 10:00 , as George Edwards was pulling out of the parking lot of Sofia Mendes 's apartment building in Puerto Rico , Dr. Hideo Kikuchi was called in from his early - morning golf game , just outside Barstow , California , to take a call from Masao Yanoguchi . Within forty - five minutes , the staff of the Goldstone Station was assembled and the Arecibo discovery was confirmed . Several individuals at Goldstone considered seppuku . The shift boss , who should have noticed the discovery before Jimmy , resigned immediately , and while he did not actually kill himself , his hangover the next morning was very nearly lethal . By 10:20 , that Sunday morning , Sofia Mendes had brewed a pot of Turkish coffee , closed the cheap , ugly curtains over the window of her one - room efficiency apartment to block out distractions , and sat down I02 MARY DORIA RUSSELL to code the Al system that would automate request scheduling for the Arecibo Radio Telescope . She put Dr. Sandoz 's speculations out of mind . Arbeit macht frei , she thought grimly . Work could buy her freedom , sooner or later . So she worked , to make it sooner . Emilio Sandoz , back in La Perla by 11:03 , called D. W. Yarbrough in New Orleans and spoke to him for some time . Then he sprinted to the chapel - cum - community center , where he threw on the simple vestments he used and celebrated Mass for his small congregation at 11:35 . The homily was on the nature of faith . Anne Edwards was absent . At 5:53 P.M. , Rome time , a video transmission from D. W. Yarbrough , New Orleans Provincial , interrupted the late - afternoon nap of Tomás da Silva , thirty - first General of the Society of Jesus . The Father General did not return to his room , nor did he appear for his evening meal . Brother Salvator Rivera cleared up the untouched dishes at nine P.M. , muttering darkly about the waste of food . The Japanese ambassador to the United States left Washington on a chartered plane at 11:45 A.M. local time and arrived in San Juan three and a half hours later . While he was in flight , news of the discovery flashed from system to system around the astronomical world . Virtually all radio astronomers dropped whatever they were doing and aimed telescopes at Alpha Centauri , although there were a few who were working on the origin of the universe and did not care greatly about planets , inhabited or otherwise . Waiting for the world press to converge on Arecibo , an archivist for ISAS posed the Arecibo staff with various dignitaries as they assembled at the dish to grace history with their presences . Jimmy Quinn , more than a little overwhelmed by what was happening , was nevertheless able to appreciate the humor of once more finding himself standing in the exact center of the back row . The tallest kid in every class since preschool , he had a large collection of group pictures in which , in every single solitary one , he was standing in the exact center of the back row . After the pictures were taken , Jimmy asked permission to call his mother . Better late than never . The news conference was carried live , worldwide , at 21:30 G.M.T. In Boston , Massachusetts , Mrs. Eileen Quinn , recently divorced , watched it alone . She wept and laughed and hugged herself and wished someone had told Jimmy to get his hair cut or at least to comb it . And that shirt ! she thought , dismayed as always by Jimmy 's taste in clothes . When the Ice THE SPARROW 103 conference was over , she called everyone she knew , except Kevin Quinn , the bastard . By 5:56 P.M. , before the news conference in Arecibo had ended , two enterprising fifteen - year - old boys had broken into Jimmy Quinn 's home system by way of his public web address and pirated the code needed to reproduce the music electronically . The Arecibo system was secure but it had never occurred to Jimmy , an honest man , to put a serious lock on his own . It would be weeks before he realized that his inability to imagine theft had led to the vast enrichment of an illegal offshore media company that bought the code from the kids . It was 8:30 on Monday morning in Tokyo when the conference ended . Legitimate bids to reproduce and market the ET music began to flood in to ISAS almost immediately . The Director of the Institute for Space and Astronautical Science deferred to the Secretary General of the United Nations , pointing out that there was a long - standing agreement that any transmission received by the SETI program was the possession of all humankind . Anne Edwards , hearing this on the radio as she and George fixed supper , was disgusted . “
46440	46444	45500	45500	George	315	” George snorted . “
46472	46479	45500	45500	George	315	” he said , wheedling slightly , “
46491	46492	45500	45500	George	315	” “
46501	46502	46499	46499	George	315	” “
46506	46545	46499	46499	George	315	” Anne turned very slowly from the sink and looked narrowly at her beloved husband of over forty years . After drying her hands on a towel , she folded it neatly and laid it on the counter . “
46549	46556	46499	46499	George	315	” she suggested , smiling prettily , “
46560	46569	46572	46572	George	315	” George laughed , which irritated her further . “
46588	46589	46577	46577	You	315	” “
46607	46612	46577	46577	You	315	” he admitted belligerently . “
46630	46634	46622	46622	You	315	” Anne blinked . “
46705	46706	46707	46707	We	1798	” “
46712	46720	46709	46710	each other	1801	” Anne said , a little defensively . "

46746	46754	46755	46755	They	1794	” She turned back to the sink . “
46773	46774	46755	46755	They	1794	” “
46778	46795	46755	46755	They	1794	” George asked , and she could hear the self - satisfied smile in his voice . “
46817	46818	46821	46821	George	315	” “
46831	46839	46821	46821	George	315	" Anne said , spinning around furiously . “
46860	46876	46855	46855	I	0	” she snarled , brandishing a dessert fork . He laughed and she cooled off . “
46891	46898	46889	46889	George	315	” she said , eyes serious , “
46926	47015	47016	47017	Mr. Quinn	353	” Supper was unusually quiet in the Edwards household that evening . AT THE END of that long Sunday , Jimmy was called into the office of Masao Yanoguchi , who took note of the ludicrous rumpled clothing and the red - rimmed eyes and estimated that the boy had been awake for almost thirty - six hours . He waved Quinn into a chair and watched the comically elongated framework fold itself into a sitting position . The guard 's log was open on Yanoguchi 's desk . “
47049	47050	47051	47052	A friend	1023	” “
47095	47142	47143	47143	I	0	" Yanoguchi let the silence fill the room . Jimmy twisted his watch around and around his wrist in unconscious mimicry of Sofia , hours earlier . He stared at the floor for a few moments and then glanced at Yanoguchi but looked away almost immediately . “
47157	47174	47152	47153	someone else	1812	" Jimmy stopped and this time when he looked up , he did n't turn away . “
47226	47230	47222	47222	I	0	” THE SPARROW 105 “
47239	47258	47236	47237	Mr. Quinn	353	” Yanoguchi closed the guard 's book and lifted a single small sheet of paper from his desk . “
47308	47315	47316	47316	I	0	” Yanoguchi put the memo aside . “
47339	47363	47316	47316	I	0	” He watched Quinn master his reaction and , pleased with the young man 's self - discipline , went on to say , “
47425	47438	47407	47407	I	0	” He stood , and Jimmy got to his feet as well . “
47449	47483	47441	47442	Mr. Quinn	353	” Masao Yanoguchi , arms at his sides , bowed briefly ; later , Jimmy would realize he was more surprised by this gesture than by anything else that had happened that day . “
47493	47497	47485	47485	me	0	” Yanoguchi suggested . “
47528	47681	47520	47520	You	4127	” Jimmy was too dazed to say anything . Masao Yanoguchi laughed and led the boy out toward the parking lot . THAT NIGHT , FOR the second time in as many nights , Emilio Sandoz had trouble falling asleep . He used this apartment gratis because the house was too close to the encroaching ocean ; no one else dared to stay in it anymore and the landlord had given up trying to rent it out . Tonight , alone as always in the little bedroom , Emilio stared at the cracked and patched ceiling made beautiful by moonlight reflected off the sea , and listened to the hypnotic sound of waves nearby . He knew sleep would not come easily and did not close his eyes to coax it . He 'd been prepared , to some extent , for nights like the one he 'd passed the previous evening . “
47689	47698	47682	47687	Lotta people in this ole world	1823	” D. W. Yarbrough had warned him once . “
47723	47995	47721	47721	son	4260	” So even before he met Sofia Mendes , he understood that he 'd have to reckon with someone like her . He no longer denied the turmoil she aroused in him ; he sim- 106 MARY DORIA RUSSELL Tas ply accepted that it would take time to bring a natural response into congruence with his vows . He 'd never really questioned the vows . He accepted them as essential to the Apostolate — for making him readily available to work for the good of souls — and when the time came , he took them wholeheartedly . But at fifteen , when it all began ? He 'd have laughed himself stupid at the idea of becoming a priest . Oh , sure , D.W. got the charges dropped and got him off - island before anyone else took a shot at him , and he was grateful in a half - articulate way but in the beginning , he only intended to lie low until he was eighteen and could do as he pleased . Go to New York . Break into the minors . Box , maybe . Flyweight . Welterweight , if he filled out more . Sell again , if he had to . The first months in the Jesuit high school were a shock . He was as far behind the other students scholastically as he was ahead of them in raw experience . Few of the boys talked to him , except to goad him , and he returned the favor . D.W. made him promise one thing : not to hit anyone . “
48014	48179	48012	48012	son	4260	” Nobody from his family ever wrote or called , much less visited . His brother beat the rap , D.W. told him toward the end of the first semester , but still blamed Emilio for what happened . Well , fuck him , who gives a shit ? he thought savagely and swore he 'd never cry again . He went over the wall that night . Found a whore , got wrecked . Came back defiant . If anybody noticed he was gone , no one said anything about it . The tide began to turn for him about eight months into his sophomore year . The quiet orderliness of life in the boarding school began to seduce him . No crises , no sudden terror , no gunshots and screaming in the night . No beatings . Each day planned , no surprises . Almost in spite of himself , he did well at Latin . Won a prize , even . “
48183	48674	48675	48675	Lord	1831	” He liked the sound of that . Rolled the word around in his mind . He did better junior year , despite the fact that he spent nearly all of it arguing with the priests . So much of what he knew about religion struck him as total bullshit ; he was disarmed when the fathers freely admitted that some stories were in fact pious fictions . But , judging his character , they dared him to cut through what he called the crap : to find the core of truth , carefully preserved and offered to all comers through the centuries . As the months passed , he began to feel as though something in his chest were loosening , as though something that had kept a grip on his THE SPARROW 107 heart had begun to let go . And then one night , the image of a full - blown rose unfolding petal by petal from its tightly wrapped bud came to him in a brief wordless dream and he woke from it , shattered , face wet with tears shed in sleep . He told no one of this dream , tried hard to forget it himself . But when he was seventeen , he entered the novitiate . Many were surprised , but as D. W. Yarbrough pointed out , Emilio had a good deal in common with the Basque soldier who had founded the Society of Jesus in the sixteenth century . Like Ignatius of Loyola , Emilio Sandoz had known brutality and death and stinking fear , and as the days of silence during the Long Retreat passed , he had a past worthy of the name to reconsider and to turn away from . Things that drove other young men from the path to priesthood were balm to him : the ordo regularis , the liturgical cadences , the quiet , the purposefulness . Even the celibacy . For , looking back on his chaotic youth , Emilio had no experience of sex that was not about power or pride or lust undiluted by affection . It was easy to believe that to live as a celibate was a charism - a special kind of grace . And so , it began : after the novitiate , classical and humane studies , and then philosophy . Regency , when the scholastic was sent out to teach in one of the Society 's high schools . Then years of theology with ordination at last , and from there further : to tertianship and final vows . Perhaps three out of ten who began Jesuit formation stayed the course . Emilio Sandoz , to the astonishment of many who 'd known him as a boy , was among them . And yet , in all those years of preparation , the prayer that had resonated most strongly in his soul was the cry , “
48686	48846	48847	48847	Son	4260	” He found the life of Jesus profoundly moving ; the miracles , on the other hand , seemed a barrier to faith , and he tended to explain them to himself in rational terms . It was as though there were only seven loaves and seven fishes . Maybe the miracle was that people shared what they had with strangers , he thought in the darkness . He was aware of his agnosticism , and patient with it . Rather than deny the existence of something he could n't perceive himself , he acknowledged the authenticity of his uncertainty and carried on , praying in the face of his doubt . After all , Ignatius of Loyola , a soldier who had killed and whored and made a thorough mess of his soul , said you could judge prayer worthwhile simply if you could act more decently , think more clearly afterward . As D.W. once told him , "
48873	49189	49190	49190	You	1834	” And by that kindly if inelegant standard , Emilio Sandoz could believe himself to be a man of God . So , while he hoped someday to find his way to a place in his soul that was closed to him now , he was content to be where he was . He never asked God to prove His existence to little Emilio Sandoz , just because he was acting less like a shithead nowadays . He never asked for anything , really . What he 'd been given was more than enough to be grateful for , whether or not God was there to receive or care about thanks . Lying in bed , that warm August night , he felt no Presence . He was aware of no Voice . He felt as alone in the cosmos as ever . But he was beginning to find it hard to avoid thinking that if ever a man had wanted a sign from God , Emilio Sandoz had been hit square in the face with one this morning , at Arecibo . He slept , after that . Sometime just before dawn the next morning , he had a dream . He was sitting in the dark , in a small place . He was alone and it was very quiet and he could hear himself breathing , the blood singing in his ears . Then a door he had not suspected was there began to open : and he could see a flare of light beyond it . This dream first sustained and then haunted him for many years afterward . 13 EARTH : AUGUST - SEPTEMBER 2019 ANNE EDWARDS was finishing up her morning appointments when she saw Emilio hanging around the clinic 's open door . She stopped midstride but then continued out of her office into the tiny reception area . “
49195	49204	49190	49190	You	1834	” he asked quietly , not coming in . "
49211	49225	49205	49205	I	0	” she conceded waspishly , drying her hands and stepping to the door . “
49234	49235	49209	49209	somebody	4110	” “

49282	49357	49384	49384	you	1838	” He shrugged and nodded and stood out of her way as she locked up . They climbed the eighty steps to the house , Anne breaking the silence only to return the greetings of people they passed . Once inside , they moved to the kitchen and Emilio perched on the stool in the corner , watching Anne steadily as she rummaged around , putting together a light lunch for both of them . “
49377	49382	49372	49372	they	4085	” he remarked conversationally . “
49388	49425	49384	49384	you	1838	” er nve IIO MARY DORIA RUSSELL She started the ancient microwave and then turned to him , leaning against the counter and meeting his eyes for the first time since noticing him at the clinic . “

49521	49579	49502	49502	you	0	” She shrugged and turned away to pull the plates out of the oven and carry them to the table . He hopped off the stool lightly and followed her to the dining room . They sat down and began to eat , the sounds of the neighborhood drifting in with the breeze through the open windows . “
49583	49587	49591	49595	a good and moral person	1840	” Emilio said , “

49694	49710	49711	49714	A woman of honor	1842	” He let her simmer down enough to pick up her fork and resume eating . “
49716	49726	49711	49714	A woman of honor	1842	” he observed , inclining his head with respect . “
49730	49753	49711	49714	A woman of honor	1842	” she muttered around a mouthful of food , glaring at her plate and spiking a piece of rigatoni with her fork . “
49764	49793	49754	49754	We	1843	” Emilio said mildly but did not elaborate when her head came up . As she struggled to swallow , he set his plate aside and became businesslike . “
49903	49918	49919	49919	George	315	” She grunted : sounds reasonable . Watching her reactions carefully , he continued , “
49948	50301	49935	49935	he	315	” THE SPARROW III OWHe expected surprise and anger . He saw resignation . It suddenly came to him that George might leave Anne and that she might be willing to let him go . The possibility made him go cold . Beyond their broad and useful professional qualifications , Anne and George Edwards were possessed of a fair degree of wisdom and a joint total of more than 120 years of alert experience of the world , combined with physical toughness and emotional stability . It had never occurred to him that one of them might stay behind . Since proposing the mission , Emilio had been taken aback by the pace of things . What had begun in laughter , almost as a joke , was snowballing , changing lives . Already , time and money were being spent in quantities that staggered him . And if the speed of events scared him , the precision with which the pieces were falling into place was even more unnerving . He went sleepless , unable to decide which was harder to live with : the idea that he had started all this , or the possibility that God had . The only way he could reassure himself during these midnight debates was to believe that wiser heads than his were making the decisions . If he could not put his faith directly in God , who remained unknowable , he could place it in the structure of the Society and in his superiors - in D. W. Yarbrough and in Father General da Silva . Now he felt himself rocked again by doubt . What if the whole thing was a mistake and it cost the Edwardses ' marriage ? And as quickly as that passed his mind , he caught another glimpse of the serenity that sometimes came to him lately . Anne and George , he felt sure , were meant to be a part of the mission , if the mission was meant to be . And when he spoke again , Anne heard only calm and reason . “
50396	50401	50366	50367	the physicists	791	" he told her . “
50434	50435	50438	50438	we	1846	” “

50475	50480	50471	50473	a religious man	1852	” Emilio said ironically , “
50499	50510	50492	50492	God	290	” He saw that set her off again and laughed . “
50546	50612	50613	50613	Anne	332	” He wanted to tell her how much it meant to him to think that she would be part of this , but Emilio suspected he 'd taken the subject as far as he could . He pushed his chair from the table and stood , picking up their plates and taking them to the kitchen . Out of sight , he called to her , “
50621	50622	50616	50616	I	0	” “
50625	50630	50631	50631	I	0	” she asked suspiciously . “

50679	50705	50668	50668	I	0	” He came out of the kitchen and leaned against the doorjamb , arms across his chest , grinning , not fooled for a moment . "
50713	50723	50724	50726	Dalton Wesley Yarbrough	375	" she demanded ungraciously , refusing to be charmed . “
50749	50780	50745	50747	the Southern Baptists	1861	” he announced with ceremony , standing at attention , a butler introducing the next guest to enter a ballroom . She put her head in her hands , defeated . “
50806	50814	50798	50798	I	0	” she said in tones of wonderment . “

50830	50839	50840	50840	they	4651	” said Emilio Sandoz with a Texas twang , “
50855	50902	50903	50905	DR . QUINN	428	” She laughed , reached behind her to the bookcase , and pitched a hardcover novel at him . He caught it with one hand and flipped it back at her . They spoke no more about the mission , but a truce had been reached . “
50925	50969	50918	50918	you	428	” Jimmy was no longer startled to find reporters waiting outside his apartment at eight in the morning and no longer amused that they routinely promoted him to doctor . He pushed past the crowd and made his way to the Ford . Murmuring “
50973	51005	50918	50918	you	428	” Jimmy got into the car , the THE SPARROW 113 crowd closing around the vehicle , shouting questions , aiming AV pickups at him . Jimmy let the window down . “
51034	51035	51027	51027	I	0	” “
51045	51050	51027	51027	I	0	” someone called out . “
51064	51068	51054	51054	they	1865	" asked another . “
51075	51120	51121	51121	We	1866	” Jimmy assured them . With the entire scientific community and a goodly portion of the world 's population looking over his shoulder , Jimmy Quinn had coordinated a concentrated effort by radio astronomers to listen for additional transmissions . There were n't any . “
51150	51160	51141	51141	they	1865	” he said , starting to raise the window . “
51170	51171	51163	51163	I	0	” “
51202	51203	51183	51183	Stefansky	429	” “
51212	51257	51209	51210	Dr. Quinn	430	” Skeptics had begun to flood the nets with alternate explanations for the music , experimenting with obscure folk traditions , running the music backward or playing with the frequency , to show how alien human music could sound , especially when modified electronically . “
51268	51288	51209	51210	Dr. Quinn	430	” Jimmy still found it hard to be rude enough to drive away abruptly , but he was learning . “
51309	51530	51301	51301	I	0	” Apologizing , he eased the car out of the crowd and drove to the Arecibo dish , where another mob was waiting . THE MEDIA EVENTUALLY went on to other things . Radio telescopes around the world returned one by one to projects that had been under way before August 3rd . But in Rome , coded transmissions continued to move along the clear - cut Jesuit chain of command , from Father General to Provincial to Rector to individual priest given an assignment . There were practical decisions to be made , many scientific teams to organize . Tomás da Silva , thirty - first General of the Society of Jesus , remained convinced of the authenticity of the signal . The theological rationale for this mission had been worked out decades before there was any evidence of other sentient species in the universe : mere considerations of scale suggested that human beings were not the sole purpose of creation . So . Now 114 MARY DORIA RUSSELL there was proof . God had other children . And when it was time for Tomás da Silva to make a decision about acting on this knowledge , he quoted the bald and artless words of Emilio Sandoz , to whom he had spoken on the evening of the discovery . “
51543	51586	51541	51541	them	1871	” His private secretary , Peter Lynam , questioned this on August 30 , 2019 , but Father General da Silva smiled and dismissed the troubling slenderness of the reed that supported all their deliberate and complex plans to contact the Singers . “
51610	51629	51588	51588	you	1872	” the Father General asked . He was a man of great spirituality and almost no business sense . “
51642	51699	51636	51636	I	0	" Peter Lynam did not argue but it was clear that he thought the Father General was chasing wild geese . Lynam was , in fact , losing his nerve about the whole expensive business . Seeing his secretary 's barely concealed misgivings , Tomás da Silva laughed and , raising a didactic finger , declared , “
51705	51721	51722	51723	a fool	1873	” Yes , well , Lynam mused silently , perfect humility might require that one be “
51727	51789	51722	51723	a fool	1873	” but that does not rule out the possibility of being a plain fool . Four hours later , to Peter Lynam 's astonished chagrin and Tomás da Silva 's pure delight , a second transmission was detected . Despite the recent decline in interest , there were several radio telescopes set to receive the signal when it came . The word “
51791	52027	52028	52028	I	0	” was permanently retired from discussion of the songs . And around the world , those few who knew the extent of the plans for a Jesuit mission to the source of the music were greatly relieved , and began to be very excited indeed . IN THE END , it was not George or Emilio who convinced Anne Edwards to sign on to the plan . It was a bus accident . A trucker going east on the coast road swerved briefly onto the shoulder to avoid a chunk of rock in the road but then overcooked his return to the pavement . For a few moments , the truck went into the oncoming lane and sheared the side off a westbound bus that had just rounded the curve . The truck driver was killed . Among the bus passengers , there were twelve DOA , fifty - three others more or less badly hurt , THE SPARROW 115 and quite a few hysterical . By the time Anne took the call and got to the hospital , its lobby was filled with distraught relatives , and lawyers . She helped first with triage and then moved to a trauma theater , part of the team trying to save a woman in her sixties with extensive head injuries . Anne had talked to the husband in the lobby . They were tourists from Michigan . “
52048	52070	52040	52040	I	0	” He kept putting his hand to the side of his face , where his wife 's head had been hurt . “
52105	52237	52099	52099	We	1876	” Pressed , Anne had murmured something about doing their best for his wife and moved on to the next task . At dawn , the crisis was over and the patients who had passed through Emergency were distributed to their waiting relatives , to the wards , to the ICU , to the morgue . By chance , Anne glanced into an open door on her way out of the hospital and saw the man from Michigan seated at the foot of his wife 's bed , his face striped and stippled with glowing readouts from the machinery surrounding them . Anne wanted to say something comforting , but the punch - drunk reaction to hours on her feet was beginning and the only thing that came to mind was , “
52245	52284	52099	52099	We	1876	” which was clearly inappropriate . Then , oddly , the final scene of La Bohème came to her and , instructed by Puccini 's librettist , she put a hand on the man 's shoulder and whispered , “
52287	52448	52099	52099	We	1876	” When she got home , George was awake and dressed and offered her coffee , but she decided to clean up and catch a few hours of sleep . Standing in the shower , soaping herself , she glanced down at her own nakedness and a vision of the woman with the head trauma came back to her . The woman had been in good shape ; her body might go on for decades , but she 'd never know the grandkids were all grown up . One minute , she was in the State of Puerto Rico and the next minute , she was in the State of Persistent Vegetables . Jesus , Anne thought , shuddering . She rinsed off and stepped out of the shower . Towel wrapped around her wet hair and terry robe wrapped around her durable dancer 's body , she padded into the dining room and sat across the table from George . “
52451	52455	52456	52456	I	0	” she said . “
52460	52475	52456	52456	I	0	” It took him a few moments to realize what she was agreeing to . “
52480	52489	52456	52456	I	0	” Anne said , seeing that he understood . “
52507	53699	52456	52456	I	0	” SW 1 va 116 MARY DORIA RUSSELL ON SEPTEMBER 13 , Jean - Claude Jaubert received a message asking for an AV appointment to discuss a buyout of the remaining time on Sofia Mendes 's contract . The individual making the request gave no name and , seeing no referral , Jaubert denied video access but agreed to open an electronic meeting , which he would encrypt and route through several networks . Jaubert was not a criminal but his was a business subject to jealousies , hard feelings , tedious disputes ; one could not be too careful . Reestablishing contact on his own terms , he pointed out that he had recently taken a loss on Ms. Mendes 's behalf . Her association with Jaubert had been extended somewhat in compensation . Was the negotiant in a position to purchase rights to seven and a half years ? He was . Jaubert named a price and interest rate , assuming that the man would amortize the cost with a ten - year note . The reply stated a lower price , to be paid in cash . A mutually agreeable sum was found . Jaubert mentioned that he preferred , of course , Singaporean dollars . There was a slight delay . Zlotys were offered . This time it was Jaubert 's turn to hesitate . Poland was volatile , but there was an interesting possibility of making a quick profit on the currency aspect of the deal . Done , he agreed . And watching the ensuing flood of numbers wash over the screen , Jean - Claude Jaubert became a modestly richer man . Bonne chance , ma cherie , he thought . ON SEPTEMBER 14 , a third transmission from Alpha Centauri was picked up , fifteen days after the second . In the midst of the jubilation , the Arecibo staff put aside their initial reactions to the small , icy woman whose profession threatened their jobs and a little farewell party for Sofia Mendes was incorporated into the general exuberance . George Edwards arranged to have food delivered to the cafeteria and quite a few people dropped by to have some pizza or cake and to wish her good luck . Elsewhere . Far from Arecibo , they hoped , laughing goodnaturedly , but serious all the same . Sofia took these ambivalent farewells with cool grace but seemed anxious to leave . Her contractual relationship with Dr. Yanoguchi discharged , she said good - bye to Jimmy Quinn and thanked George Edwards , asking him to relay her best wishes to his wife and to Dr. Sandoz . George , smiling mysteriously , suggested that they 'd all be seeing one another again sometime , one way or another . THE SPARROW 117 an Arriving at her apartment that afternoon , wrung out from the unremitting labor of the previous weeks , Sofia fell onto the bed and fought tears . Nonsense , she told herself , just get on with it . But she conceded the need for a day of rest before informing Jaubert that she was ready for the next assignment . He had contacted her in August about the Jesuit asteroid project . It would be interesting work . There were compensations for her situation , she reminded herself . To Sandoz 's intense dismay , the Jesuits had only been willing to contract her services through Jaubert . She was surprised at the depth of his shock . Business is business , she told him and reminded Sandoz that he 'd said himself that he had no authority to speak . She 'd harbored no hopes , she assured him , and consequently had none to be dashed . That seemed to make him feel worse . A strange man , she thought . Intelligent , but naive . And slow to react to changed circumstances , she felt . Then again , most people were . Releasing her hair from its habitual chignon , she ran a bath , planning to soak in it until the water was tepid . Idly , waiting for the tub to fill , she checked her messages to see what , if anything , was awaiting her attention . She read the transcript of the negotiations twice and still found it impossible to believe . The sheer viciousness of Peggy Soong 's practical joke choked her . Hands shaking , stunned by the violence of her outrage , Sofia turned off the bathwater , tied her hair back and went to work on breaking the file 's intervening encryption , hoping to trace it to Soong , trying to imagine what she could do to the woman that was terrible enough to repay her for this pointless , heartlessIt took only minutes to realize that Peggy was not involved with this at all . It was , in fact , Jaubert 's code . Sofia had written it herself , early in their association . It had been modified over the years , but her style was unmistakable . Working through the transcript , she confirmed that the transaction had taken place . She accessed the international monetary exchange and saw that Jaubert had made a 2.3 percent gain overnight by hanging on to the zlotys . Singapore was down ; Jaubert 's luck was intact . But she could not pry from the network the origin of the money . Who on earth would have done such a thing ? she wondered , very nearly frightened now . Jaubert had been a reasonable man to work for , had never asked her to do anything illegal or distasteful . But the possibility had always existed . 118 MARY DORIA RUSSELL There had to be a legal transfer of rights to her . She combed through the civil records covering her contract , registered in Monaco , thinking over and over , Who owns me now ? What bloodsucking vampire owns me now ? Finding the correct file , she read the final entry and sat back , hand to her mouth , throat so tight she thought she might suffocate . Contract terminated . Free agent . Inquiries : contact principal directly . As though from a distance , she heard a wail . She walked numbly to the window and pushed the curtain away , looking outside for the child who was sobbing somewhere nearby . There was no one there , of course , no one else anywhere to be heard . After a while , she walked to the bathroom to blow her nose and wash her face and think about what she might do next . WHEN THE BELL rang two nights later , Anne Edwards went to the door and saw Emilio looking like a boy again , standing behind a tall , lean priest in his fifties . Late that night , alone at last in their bedroom , Anne , eyes bulging , confessed to George in a tiny , strangled voice , “
53720	53721	53726	53728	a Texas Jesuit	1879	” “
53742	53749	53750	53750	Jesus	344	” George admitted in a whisper . “

53771	53776	53755	53755	you	0	” Anne said decisively . “
53806	53864	53798	53798	I	0	” George said , suddenly breaking up . That set Anne off , and pretty soon they were hanging on to each other , appalled and ashamed , laughing helplessly , but trying to be as quiet as they could , since the subject of their merriment was in the guest room , right down the hallway . “
53873	53886	53798	53798	I	0	” Anne gasped , struggling to sober up and losing the battle . “

53912	53963	53908	53910	The poor bastard	1882	” George said quietly , getting ahold of himself momentarily , trying to sound sympathetic . There was a fleeting silence , as they each pictured D.W. , his long broken nose almost as badly askew as his cast eye , loose - lipped grin displaying teeth just as disheveled . “
53971	53979	53964	53964	I	0	” Anne whispered , pleading for understanding . “

54007	54067	54068	54070	Dr. Anne Edwards	332	” George asked . Anne , whining and holding her stomach , fell onto the bed and buried her face in a pillow . George , completely undone , followed her . It had been an evening of laughter , in fact , and none of it at D.W. 's expense until the Edwardses reached their bedroom after midnight . “
54076	54089	54072	54074	Mr. George Edwards	315	” Emilio had said , formally introducing his guest at their door , “
54110	54111	54105	54108	the Society of Jesus	729	” “

54138	54173	54128	54128	I	0	” Anne said . If she was startled by him , there was no hint of it then . She took the hand he offered , knowing what was coming but ready for him . “
54193	54208	54184	54184	Milio	437	” D.W. said , smiling , purest malice dancing in his variously arranged eyes . “
54242	54243	54254	54254	Father	436	” “
54256	54261	54254	54254	Father	436	” Anne sighed bravely . “
54304	54394	54296	54296	we	1892	” D.W. roared , and they were off and running . Emilio , anxious that these people who meant so much to him should like one another , unleashed a smile like sunrise , went to his chair in the corner and settled in to watch the show . The dinner conversation , as hot and colorful as the barbecue sauce , soon found its center of gravity around politics , there being a presidential - election campaign heating up in which a Texan figured prominently , as usual . “
54402	54406	54296	54296	we	1892	” George protested . “
54422	54426	54427	54428	Lyndon Johnson	438	” D.W. hollered . “
54433	54438	54427	54428	Lyndon Johnson	438	” George soldiered on . “
54453	54457	54445	54445	You	1896	” D.W. insisted . “
54471	54485	54458	54459	Real Texans	440	” Wordlessly , Emilio handed a napkin to Anne , who wiped her nose “
54489	54493	54486	54487	Gibson Whitmore	441	” George continued . “

54549	54554	54555	54555	D.W.	377	” Emilio said informatively , “
54572	54672	54555	54555	D.W.	377	” It was three hours after they sat down to eat when Yarbrough pushed himself reluctantly away from the table , declared that he was stuffed insensible , and then told three more stories that left everyone else at the table worn out and breathless , stomachs and cheeks aching . And it was yet another hour before the four of them got up and started moving glasses and dishes into the kitchen . But there , finally , in the hard bright light of that room , the real reason for D. W. Yarbrough 's visit came out . “
54697	54717	54678	54678	I	0	” D.W. announced , hooking his hands over the top of the door frame and stretching like a gorilla . “

There was ample historical precedent for a mixed crew and solid logic in selecting people with a broad range of experience , but with that established , Father General da Silva had , in the end , simply decided the issue in favor of what appeared to him to be God 's will . “
54924	54929	54932	54932	ma'am	1863	” Anne said shrewdly . “
54939	54950	54951	54951	Emilio	291	" The accent and color abated somewhat as D.W. continued , “
55014	55041	55042	55042	You	1863	” Anne pirouetted abruptly , finding that the glassware in the sink suddenly required her undivided attention . She tried not to let her shoulders shake . “
55046	55054	55042	55042	You	1863	” George asked , with admirable restraint . “

55131	55160	55125	55125	Scotty	443	” Anne suggested brightly , finally able to face her guest as Emilio , carrying a load of plates into the kitchen , ducked under D.W. 's arm . “

Then she remembered LeRoy Johnson , a major - league ballplayer with a similar cast in one eye who consistently batted over .290 , and she guessed their brains compensated for the problem somehow . “
55476	55480	55481	55481	You	1925	” George said . “

56136	56375	56131	56131	I	0	” Sofia said . She ended the video conference and sent the code . LOOKING HER PROPOSITION over , lan Sekizawa lapsed into thoughtfulness . She wanted a good - sized rock , junk , ice - bearing , with a lot of silicates , more or less cylindrical around the long axis ; crew quarters for eight , engines and mining robots included , used if possible , installed if necessary . He tried to reckon who would want such a thing and for what . A drug factory ? But then why ask for the mining equipment ? Sure , ice , but why so much silicate ? He turned it around in his mind for a while but came up with nothing that struck him as practical . From his own point of view , it was sweet . Before Sofia 's Al wizardry , Aussie wildcatters had gone from rock to rock , hoping to make the one big strike that could pay off the equipment mortgages they owed to Ohbayashi and set them up for life . Ninety - nine out of a hundred wildcatters went broke or crazy or both and abandoned their last asteroid with the equipment in situ . Rights reverted to Ohbayashi , which recovered the hardware whenever it was profitable to do so . He had a dozen or more rocks that could do for Sofia 's client . “
56399	56422	56390	56390	she	1942	” he recited blandly , alone in his office . Sofia was offering a fair price . He could bury the transaction in “
56427	56778	56390	56390	she	1942	” maybe . The rocks were worth fuck - all as things stood . Why not sell one off ? he thought . And who gives a damn what it 's used for ? WAITING IN HER small rented room for lan Sekizawa 's response to the proposal , Sofia Mendes stared out the window at the Old City of Jerusalem and asked herself why she had come here . In her first hours of freedom , she had decided simply to carry on as before . She informed the Jesuits in Rome of her new status , assured them of her willingness to act as general contractor on the previously negotiated terms , and made arrangements to have the agreement rewritten in her own name . There was a 30 percent advance payment and , realizing that she could fulfill the contract from anywhere in the world , she had used the money to buy passage to Israel . Why ? I 24 MARY DORIA RUSSELL Without her mother to light the Sabbath candles , without her father to sing the ancient blessings over the bread and wine , she 'd lost touch with the religion of her truncated childhood . But after years of wandering , she felt a need to go home somehow , wanted to see if she was capable of belonging somewhere . There was nothing left for her in Istanbul - peaceful now , exhausted from achieving its own destruction . And her ties to Spain were too tenuous , too faint and historical . So . Israel . Home by default , she supposed . On her first day in Jerusalem , shyly , never having done so before , she 'd sought out a mikveh , a place of ritual cleansing . She chose a place at random , unaware that it catered to Israeli brides preparing for their weddings . The mikveh lady who took care of her assumed at first that she was about to be married and was distressed to find that Sofia did not even have a sweetheart . “
56793	56804	56392	56392	her	1942	” the woman exclaimed , laughing at Sofia 's blush . “
56829	56952	56392	56392	her	1942	” It was hopeless to contradict the good - natured advice , and she wondered why she wanted to , as she allowed herself to be preened and cleaned - hair , nails , everything rinsed , smoothed and shined , her body made free of cosmetics , of dust , of the past . Why not stay ? she asked herself . ren Wrapped in a white sheet , she was escorted to the mikveh itself and then left alone to descend the tiled steps , with their intricate mosaic designs , into the warm , pure water . The mikveh lady , standing discreetly behind a half - closed door , helped her remember the Hebrew prayers and urged her , “
56982	57258	56976	56976	I	0	” Breaking the surface of the water for the third time , smoothing her hair away from her forehead and pressing the moisture from her eyes , Sofia felt weightless and suspended in time as the words of the old prayers drifted through her mind . There was a blessing for tasting the first fruit after a winter of want , now said for new beginnings , she recalled , when some turning point had come to a life . Blessed art Thou , O God , Ruler of the Universe , for giving us life , for sustaining us , for enabling us to reach this season .... Perhaps it was the mikveh lady 's talk of marriage and children that brought Emilio Sandoz to mind . Sofia Mendes had kept her distance from men since that final night with Jaubert — too much , too early . Even THE SPARROW 125 so , she found the idea of priestly celibacy barbaric . What she knew of Catholicism was repellent , with its persecutions , its focus on death , on martyrdom , its central symbol an instrument of Roman criminal justice , appalling in its violence . In the beginning , it was an act of heroic selfcontrol to work with Sandoz : a Spaniard , dressed for mourning , heir to the Inquisition and the expulsion , the representative of a pirate religion that took the bread and wine of Shabbat and turned it into a cannibalistic rite of flesh and blood . She had challenged him on this point one night at Anne and George 's , inhibitions weakened by Ronrico : “
57265	57285	56976	56976	I	0	” There was a silence as he sat still , apparently looking at the dinner plates and chicken bones . “
57292	57297	57290	57290	David	450	” he said quietly . “
57348	57362	57363	57363	I	0	” His eyes lifted and met hers : a look of lucid candor . “
57418	57432	57436	57437	Señorita Mendes	356	” Then the sunrise smile appeared , transforming his dark face like dawn . “
57459	57648	57436	57437	Señorita Mendes	356	” It was possible , she admitted to herself , that one had misjudged . Out of ignorance . Or prejudice . Sandoz had made no move to convert her . He was a man of impressive intelligence who seemed to her clearsouled and fulfilled . She had no idea what to make of his belief that God was calling them to contact the Singers . There were Jews who believed that God is in the world , active , purposeful . After the Holocaust , it was difficult to sustain such an idea . Certainly her own life had taught her that prayers for deliverance go unheard , unless she wanted to believe Jean - Claude Jaubert was God 's agent . Still , Israel rose from the ashes of the six million . Jaubert got her out of Istanbul . She was alive . She was free now . Sofia left the mikveh that day with a strong sense of purpose , and when she got back to her room , she contacted Sandoz in San Juan and spoke plainly , without false modesty or bravado . “
57679	57684	57673	57677	a member of the crew	1954	” she told him . “
57757	57821	57824	57825	darlin '	1957	” He did not seem at all surprised . Correct and respectful , he told her that he would relay her offer to volunteer to his superiors . Then came a meeting with the bizarre Yarbrough . He told stories and asked sly , shrewd questions and got her to laugh twice and at the end , he said in his unfathomable dialect , “
57975	57981	57971	57971	you	1957	” She stared at him . “
57989	57993	57971	57971	you	1957	” He grinned . “
57996	58106	57971	57971	you	1957	” Standing at the window now , she could see the Kotel , the Western Wall . Too far away to hear the murmur of prayers , she could watch the tidal ebb and flow of tourists and pilgrims , pointing , davening , weeping , placing small pieces of paper bearing petitions and prayers of gratitude into the spaces between the ancient stones . And she knew why she was here . She had come to Israel to say good - bye to the past . She heard her system 's message signal and opened the file , read lan Sekizawa 's one - word reply and smiled . “
58109	58471	57971	57971	you	1957	” the screen said . THAT YEAR , SEVERAL superb works of Renaissance art were sold without publicity to private investors . At an auction in London , a price was found for what had previously been considered a priceless collection of seventeenth - century Oriental porcelains . Long - held pieces of property and stock portfolios quietly went on the market at calculated THE SPARROW 127 times and in carefully selected locations where considerable gains were available upon sale . It was a matter of taking profits , liquidating some assets , redeploying capital . The total needed , as Sofia Mendes predicted , was not an inconsiderable amount of money , but it did not beggar the Society by any means and did not even affect Jesuit missions and charitable projects on Earth , which were operated under current cash flow from educational and research facilities , leasing agreements and patent licenses . The sum accumulated in this way was deposited in a reliably discreet Viennese bank . Jesuits around the world were instructed to monitor the public news media and private data nets for any mention of Jesuit financial activity and to relay that information to the Father General 's office at Number 5 . No pattern was detected , all that year . nev 14 NAPLES : MAY 2060 NOT EVEN VESUVIUS could delay spring forever . As the weather moderated , Emilio Sandoz found he could sleep more easily in the open , lulled by waves and bird cries , his back against sun - warmed rock . He thought perhaps it was the sunlight on his closed eyes that banished the darkness even in sleep ; he was less likely to awaken sweating and nauseated . Sometimes the dreams were merely puzzling , not terrifying . Or vile . He was on a beach , with a child from La Perla . He was apologizing because , though his hands were unharmed in the dream , he could n't seem to do the magic tricks any longer . The child looked at him with the strange and beautiful double - irised eyes of the VaRakhati . “
58474	58488	58498	58502	c'è qualcuno che vuol vedervi	1964	” she said , with the confident practicality of the half - grown , “
58494	58495	58496	58496	Padre	454	” "
58504	58572	58496	58496	Padre	454	” He sat up , breathing hard , disoriented . He could still hear the dream - child 's words and it seemed important to him not to forget what they were before he 'd had time to think about them . He rubbed his eyes with the back of his forearm , resisting the impulse to shout at the boy for waking him . THE SPARROW 129 "
58579	58673	58674	58674	Grazie	456	” A man who would see you , the boy was saying . What was his name ? Giancarlo . He was ten . His mother was a local farmer who sold produce to restaurants in Naples . Sometimes the retreat house ran short when there were extra people in the refectory , and Giancarlo brought vegetables to the kitchen . He often hung around , hoping to be sent on an errand , to bring a message to the sick priest , perhaps , or to help him up the stairs sometimes . “
58676	58828	58674	58674	Grazie	456	” Emilio said , hoping this was thanks in Italian , but unsure . He wanted to tell the boy that he could manage the stairs on his own now but could n't find the words . It was so long ago , so many languages ago . Pulling himself together , he stood carefully and climbed slowly off the huge weathered rock that was his sanctuary , using his bare feet to find purchase , startling badly when Giancarlo suddenly produced a stream of treble Italian . It was too fast , too complicated , and Emilio was whipsawed between fury at being asked to understand something that was beyond him and despair that so much was beyond him . Slow down , he told himself . It 's not his fault . He 's a good kid , probably just curious about a man wearing gloves but no shoes ... “
58838	59049	58834	58834	I	0	” he said finally , moving again , hoping the sentiment would get through . The boy nodded and shrugged and offered him a hand he did n't dare accept , to steady him on the last jump to the ground . He wondered then if Giancarlo knew about his hands , and if he 'd be frightened by them . It would be another week before he could try the braces again . In the meantime , he wore Candotti 's fingerless gloves , which had been , as John predicted , a good and simple solution to some problems : concealment , for example . Emilio leaned against the rock for a time , and then smiled and jerked his head across the beach toward the long stone stairway . Giancarlo smiled back and they walked along in companionable silence . The boy stayed close as they worked their way up the bluff , killing time by hopping with two feet from step to step , spending his energy with the profligacy of the young and healthy , uncomfortable in the presence of enfeeblement . It was slow going but they got all the way up the stairs without pausing more than a few moments now and then . “
59058	59452	59053	59053	padre	1965	” Giancarlo said , in the encouraging if slightly patronizing tone used by well - meaning adults addressing small children who succeed at something very simple . Recognizing both the words and the attitude , Emilio realized in 130 MARY DORIA RUSSELL wari time that the child would pat him on the back ; expecting the touch , he was able to tolerate it and gravely gave the child his thanks again , sure now that grazie was Italian . And once again , he veered unsteadily , warmed by the good - heartedness of this child , staggered by mourning for another . With a gesture and a smile that took a great deal of effort , he gave the boy leave to go . Then he rested on a stone bench at the top of the stairs , to give himself time to recover before going in . The habit of obedience was not extinguished in him ; summoned , he appeared , even if the fear made his heart pound . It took him longer to get a grip on his feelings than it did to get over the climb from the beach . Regular hours , regular food , regular exercise , on orders from the Father General . Given half a chance , his body was healing , repairing itself . Hybrid vigor , Anne would have said , half - seriously . The strengths of two continents . He thought sometimes of the peculiar peacefulness he 'd experienced toward the end of the voyage back , watching blood seep from his hands and thinking , This will kill me , and then I can stop trying to understand . He wondered then if Jesus expected gratitude as Lazarus emerged , stinking , from the crypt . Maybe Lazarus was a disappointment to everyone , too . THE SHORT , STOCKY man waiting for him was almost past middle age , wearing a black skull cap and a dark plain suit . A rabbi , Emilio thought , his heart sinking . A relative of Sofia 's , a second cousin perhaps , here to demand an accounting . The man had turned at the sound of Emilio 's footsteps . Smiling a little sadly through a full and curling beard mostly gone to gray , he said , “
59457	59501	59502	59502	I	0	” A Sephardic rabbi might use Spanish but would not have addressed a stranger so familiarly . Emilio felt himself slide into helpless frustration and looked away . But the man saw his bewilderment and seemed to sense his fragile state of mind . “
59508	59512	59506	59506	Father	298	” he said . “
59536	59545	59525	59526	a kid	1966	” He laughed , pointing to his beard . “
59559	59594	59553	59553	I	0	” Embarrassed , Emilio started to apologize and back away when the stranger suddenly let rip a torrent of Latin insults and taunts , the gramTHE SPARROW 131 mar flawless , the content appalling . “
59598	59617	59595	59596	Felipe Reyes	379	” Emilio breathed , mouth open with astonishment . He stepped back , the surprise was so great . “
59632	59633	59628	59630	an old man	1967	” “
59645	59651	59640	59640	you	298	” Felipe said , grinning . “
59670	59746	59662	59662	Mature	457	" For a few moments , they stood and looked at each other in wonderment , taking in the changes , visible and implied . Then Felipe broke the spell . Waiting for Emilio to appear , he had drawn a couple of chairs to either side of a small table near a window in the large open room and , laughing again , he motioned Emilio across and pulled out a chair for him . “
59779	59821	59822	59822	I	0	" Felipe almost said something about Jimmy Quinn but thought better of it . Instead , he fell quiet as they sat together , beaming at Sandoz , giving him time to get over the shock . Emilio finally burst out , “
59829	59830	59822	59822	I	0	” “
59834	59839	59832	59832	you	379	” Felipe said comfortably . “
59882	60006	60007	60008	Antonio Luis	458	” And he laughed delightedly at Emilio 's amazement . For the next hour , in the language of childhood , they reminisced about La Perla . It was only five or six years ago for Emilio and he found to his surprise that he could recall more names than Felipe , but Reyes knew what had happened to everyone and had a hundred stories , some funny , some sad . Of course , it had been almost forty years since Emilio had left ; he should n't have been surprised that so much of the narrative came down to a litany of deaths , and yet ... His parents were long gone but there was his brother to find out about . “
60020	60025	60018	60018	Father	298	” Felipe told him . “
60028	60034	60007	60008	Antonio Luis	458	” he made himself ask . "
60041	60049	60050	60050	He	458	” Felipe shrugged and shook his head . “
60081	60109	60075	60076	the Haitians	459	” His left hand hurt like hell and the headache was making it hard to concentrate . So many dead , he thought . So many dead ... “
60178	60179	60173	60173	you	4078	” “
60184	60194	60173	60173	you	4078	” Squinting now against the light , Emilio asked , “
60204	60205	60196	60196	Maria	378	” “
60209	60240	60242	60242	she	378	” Felipe paused to smile thanks at a brother who brought them both cups of tea , unasked for . Neither drank . Hands in his lap , Felipe continued , “
60311	60312	60309	60309	Father	4078	” “
60325	60441	60323	60323	Anne	332	” It came to him that it must have been Anne and George who 'd bought out Sofia 's contract . He remembered Anne laughing about how much fun it was to give away money they 'd saved for retirement . He remembered Anne laughing . He wanted Felipe to leave . Felipe saw the distress but went on , voice quiet , insistent on the good that Sandoz had done . The trees planted on Chuuk Island had matured ; a man who 'd learned to read and write as a teenager in the Jesuit literacy program became a revered poet , his work illuminated by Arctic beauty and the souls of his people . “
60505	60548	60490	60490	People	4085	” Emilio sat , eyes closed , unable to look at the man he had inspired to take up the burdens of priesthood . That of all things he did not wish responsibility for . The words of Jeremiah came to him : “
60561	60584	60585	60585	Father	4078	” And then Reyes was kneeling in front of him and through the roaring in his head , he heard Felipe say , "
60597	60686	60585	60585	Father	4078	” Let me see : let me understand . Emilio held out his hands because , hideous as he found them , they were far easier to display than what was inside him . Gently , Felipe pulled the gloves away and as the mutilation was revealed , there was the familiar whir of servomotors and microgears , the metallic susurration of mechanical joints , but strangely muffled by the overlayment of extraordinarily lifelike artificial skin . Felipe took Emilio 's fingers in his own cool mechanical hands . “
60728	60732	60723	60723	I	0	” Felipe admitted . “
60788	60828	60829	60830	That bastard	1999	” There was a silence . Felipe Reyes 's hips were beginning to get arthritic and he suddenly felt like the old man he was becoming , getting to his feet and watching the bitterness transform Emilio 's face . “
60838	60856	60860	60860	he	301	” He was up now , moving away from Felipe , pacing , putting distance between them . “
60897	60916	60894	60895	That sonofabitch	2001	” Sandoz said , incredulous , fluent in his fury . He suddenly stopped and turned on Felipe . “
60938	60976	60918	60918	you	0	” Felipe Reyes pulled himself to his full , if modest , height and looked frankly at Emilio , whom he had idolized in youth and whom he still wanted to love , in spite of everything . “
60992	61016	60984	60986	The Father General	754	” Sandoz went very still . When he spoke , his voice had the quiet , nearly calm sound of viciously controlled anger . “
61039	61080	61019	61019	Your	379	” Felipe found there was nothing he could say and , helpless , let the silence linger , Sandoz watching him like a snake . Suddenly , the man 's eyes lit up dangerously . Comprehension dawning , Felipe knew . “
61087	61118	61019	61019	Your	379	" Sandoz asked , the voice caressing now , brows up , mouth open slightly , waiting for confirmation . Felipe nodded . To bitterness , Sandoz added amused contempt . "
61128	61136	61126	61126	God	290	” he cried , in direct address . “
61163	61164	61154	61154	you	379	” “
61184	61185	61177	61177	I	0	” “
61188	61202	61177	61177	I	0	” Emilio said softly , with a smile that left his eyes untouched . “
61214	61243	61244	61244	You	379	” Felipe Reyes endured Emilio 's gaze as long as he could . He looked away finally , but he could not close out the soft savage voice . “
61330	61594	61323	61323	you	379	” When Felipe looked up , Sandoz was gone . VINCENZO GIULIANI , BACK in his Rome office , was informed of the fiasco within the hour . In truth , the Father General had not summoned Felipe Reyes to serve as Emilio Sandoz 's prosecutor . There would be no trial , no devil 's advocate , not even in the loose colloquial sense that Emilio had used . The aim of the coming inquiry was to help the Society plan its next moves regarding Rakhat . Reyes was a well - respected specialist in comparative religious studies whom Giuliani expected to be of use as Sandoz worked his way through the details of the Rakhat mission . But there was no use denying it . The Father General had also hoped that Felipe Reyes , who had known Sandoz in better days and who himself had been maimed while studying at a Pakistani university , might give Emilio a healthier perspective on the apparent uniqueness of his experience . So it was with a good deal of chagrin that Giuliani learned how badly he 'd misread Sandoz on this score . Sighing , he rose from his desk and walked to the windows to stare out at the Vatican through the rain . What a burden men like Sandoz carried into the field . Over four hundred of Ours to set the standard , he thought , and remembered his days as a novice , studying the lives of sainted , blessed and venerated Jesuits . What was that wonderful line ? “
61604	61945	61595	61602	Men astutely trained in letters and in fortitude	2007	” Enduring hardship , loneliness , exhaustion and sickness with courage and resourcefulness . Meeting torture and death with a joy that defies easy understanding , even by those who share their religion , if not their faith . So many Ho meric stories . So many martyrs like Isaac Jogues . Trekking eight hun dred miles into the interior of the New World - a land as alien to a European in 1637 as Rakhat is to us now , Giuliani suddenly realized . Feared as a witch , ridiculed , reviled for his mildness by the Indians he 'd hoped to gain for Christ . Beaten regularly , his fingers cut off joint by joint with clamshell blades — no wonder Jogues had come to Emilio 's mind . Rescued , after years of abuse and deprivation , by Dutch traders who arranged for his return to France , where he recovered , against all odds . ev THE SPARROW 135 Astonishing , really : Jogues went back . He must have known what would happen but he sailed back to work among the Mohawks , as soon as he was able . And in the end , they killed him . Horribly . How are we to understand men like that ? Giuliani had once wondered . How could a sane man have returned to such a life , knowing such a fate was likely ? Was he psychotic , driven by voices ? A masochist who sought degradation and pain ? The questions were inescapable for a modern historian , even a Jesuit historian . Jogues was only one of many . Were men like Jogues mad ? No , Giuliani had decided at last . Not madness but the mathematics of eternity drove them . To save souls from perpetual torment and estrangement from God , to bring souls to imperishable joy and nearness to God , no burden was too heavy , no price too steep . Jogues himself had written to his mother , “
61969	62010	62090	62090	John	298	” Yes , he thought , Jesuits are well prepared for martyrdom . Survival , on the other hand , could be an intractable problem . Sometimes , Vincenzo Giuliani suspected , it is easier to die than to live . “
62019	62057	62058	62058	I	0	” John Candotti called , walking across the beach . Sandoz was sitting on the rocks as usual , his back against the stone , hands exposed and loose , dangling between his drawn - up knees . “
62084	62085	62090	62090	John	298	” “
62092	62118	62090	62090	John	298	” Emilio 's eyes were closed and he had what John was beginning to recognize as the look of a man with a crushing headache . “
62130	62188	62125	62126	Father Reyes	465	” He expected an epithet , but Sandoz was back in control , or past caring . John stood on the beach , a few feet from Sandoz , and for a while looked out over the sea . There were sails in the distance , brilliant in the slanting sunlight , and the usual fishing boats . “
62195	62200	62125	62126	Father Reyes	465	” John said philosophically , “
62213	62231	62205	62207	my old dad	2012	" Emilio 's head came up and he looked at John wearily , resigned to another assault . “
62246	62251	62236	62236	you	0	” John shouted suddenly . “
62268	62287	62256	62256	you	0	” 136 MARY DORIA RUSSELL Emilio lay his head back against the rock , and laughed and laughed . “
62296	62310	62256	62256	you	0	” John said , grinning , delighted by the effect he 'd had . “
62330	62331	62323	62323	you	0	” “
62341	62345	62338	62339	Young Frankenstein	467	” Emilio gasped . “

62383	62387	62388	62389	The Odyssey	2019	” John agreed . “
62401	62417	62418	62418	I	0	” Emilio laughed again , wiping his eyes on his sleeve and catching his breath . “
62443	62458	62436	62436	I	0	” John checked at that but decided it was only a figure of speech . “
62476	62485	62462	62462	I	0	” he said prissily , mimicking Johannes Voelker . “
62496	62497	62487	62487	I	0	” “
62502	62592	62487	62487	I	0	” Emilio moved over to make room , shaking off the lingering reaction to seeing Felipe again . Preceded by his prowlike nose , John clambered up , all elbows and knees and big feet , envying Emilio 's compact neatness , the athletic grace evident even now . John made himself fairly comfortable on the unyielding surface of the rock , and the two men admired the sunset for a while . They 'd be climbing the stairs in darkness but they were both familiar with every step . “
62599	62613	62487	62487	I	0	” John said , breaking the silence as the light deepened to blue , “
62645	62646	62642	62643	the priesthood	2026	” “
62655	62704	62705	62705	I	0	" Sandoz demanded , his face in profile as hard as the bald stone outcropping they sat on . He had not spoken of leaving since the day the reporter burst into his room , when the reality of life on the outside had shouted in his face . “
62714	62715	62710	62710	you	0	” “
62739	62785	62791	62793	the THE SPARROW	377	” Emilio turned to him and , in the dusk , John could almost taste the bile rising in the other man 's throat . He waited , to give Sandoz a chance to say something , but Emilio turned back to the sunless sea . “
62818	62850	62816	62816	Emilio	291	" Elbows on his drawn - up knees , Emilio raised his hands to his head and rested the long , bony fingers there , pale and skeletal against his hair . “
62864	62912	62913	62913	Emilio	291	” He thinks the truth is too ugly for us , John had thought , coming down the stairs after a hurried conference with Brother Edward and Father Reyes . Ed thought perhaps that Sandoz did n't realize how much of his story had been made public . “
62921	62926	62915	62915	we	2029	” John said quietly . “
62934	62935	62928	62928	we	2029	” “
62940	62948	62928	62928	we	2029	” Sandoz said , his voice muffled . “
62973	63038	62965	62967	The Contact Consortium	4065	” Sandoz stood suddenly and climbed off the rock . He took off down the darkened beach , heading south , arms crossed over his chest to keep the hands tucked under his armpits . John jumped down after him and followed at a run . Overtaking Sandoz , he grabbed the smaller man 's shoulder and twisted him around , shouting at him , “
63062	63063	63070	63070	John	298	” “
63072	63091	63070	63070	John	298	" Sandoz said grimly , wrenching his shoulder out of Candotti 's grip and backing away from him . “
63098	63099	63095	63095	I	0	” “
63104	63120	63095	63095	I	0	” John yelled as Emilio turned away from him . Sandoz spun to face him . “
63124	63131	63095	63095	I	0	” he said with quiet menace , “
63149	63198	63147	63147	John	298	” He stood there , trembling slightly , flat - eyed , skin drawn taut over the bones of his face . John , his anger draining away as quickly as it had risen in him , opened his mouth to say something , but Sandoz spoke again . “
63230	63241	63224	63224	I	0	” he said lightly , but his eyes were awful . “
63264	63300	63301	63301	ANNIE	332	” Pride , yes . But also fear : For in that sleep of death what dreams may come . 15 SOLAR SYSTEM : 2021 THE STELLA MARIS : 2021 - 2022 , EARTH - RELATIVE “
63347	63431	63301	63301	ANNIE	332	” Anne laughed , amused by the image and relieved to have George home , if only for a few days while he and D.W. collected additional equipment . The past four weeks had been an anxious time for a woman whose faith in technology was more by practical default than informed conviction , but George had come back to her ebullient and confident , burying her misgivings in an avalanche of enthusiasm as she drove him home from the San Juan airport . “
63471	63472	63491	63491	you	332	” “
63477	63478	63491	63491	you	332	” “
63549	63587	63545	63545	you	332	” She kept her gaze on the road but THE SPARROW 139 the delicate fan of lines around her eyes deepened with pleasure . Her hair was piled in some kind of style George could only identify as “
63589	63599	63545	63545	you	332	” and she was wearing pearls and cream silk . “
63603	63607	63545	63545	you	332	” he said , “
63630	63631	63624	63624	you	332	" “
63648	63657	63658	63658	You	332	” Anne muttered , eyes on the traffic . “
63709	63711	63750	63750	Annie	332	” . “
63717	63729	63750	63750	Annie	332	” Anne wanted to know , but he hardly heard her . “
63789	63793	63841	63841	Doctor	4685	” She nodded . “
63823	63824	63826	63826	you	332	” “
63837	63838	63841	63841	Doctor	4685	” “
63868	63924	63955	63955	you	4685	” George closed his eyes , picturing the rest , then stared straight ahead , not seeing the traffic or San Juan , but the unique and wonderful vessel that would be their home soon , which felt cozy and nautical to him , everything in its place , neat and organized and surprisingly comfortable . “
63972	63974	63969	63969	he	342	” . "
63994	63995	63983	63983	We	2052	” “
64047	64048	64013	64013	I	0	” “
64057	64061	64013	64013	I	0	” Anne purred . “
64067	64079	64013	64013	I	0	” He leaned over and planted a kiss on her neck . “
64173	64340	64162	64162	Marc	342	” There was more about the plants and then George went on to tell her about the bridge and how the mining robots fed the mass - drivers . And Anne gathered that he and Sofia and Jimmy would be working on Al programs that would make the asteroid self - navigating on the return trip , locking onto Earth broadcasts and Sol 's radio frequency , so the system could do the kind of calculations Jimmy was doing on the trip out , in case he was killed . And there was also a VR flight simulator for the docker - lander they 'd all train on , in case D.W. was ... Anne nosed the car into a parking space at that point and shut off the motor . There was a long silence , both of them sobered by the knowledge that casualties were likely . They were all being cross - trained , to build redundancy into the final crew of eight . “
64353	64358	64162	64162	Marc	342	” George said finally . “
64366	64371	64162	64162	Marc	342	” Anne said firmly . “
64381	64799	64162	64162	Marc	342	” ANNE STILL PLAYED Official Skeptic , but the past eighteen months had worked a surprising internal change in her . Time after time , it looked as though the entire mission would be scrubbed ; each time , Anne marveled as Jesuit industry and Jesuit prayer were brought to bear on the problems . The first asteroid turned out to have a faultline likely to give way under one G of acceleration . The second appeared perfect until a remote assay showed too high an iron content , which would foul the engines over the long term . A few nights later , the evening prayers of a Jesuit physicist were interrupted by the sudden realization that his loadbearing calculations were unduly limited by the specification of a roughly cylindrical rock . He finished his prayers , rapidly rethought his assumptions , and woke up Jesuit colleagues in several different time zones . Twelve hours later , Sofia Mendes was authorized to contact lan Sekizawa and instruct him to broaden the search to include asteroids of nearly any shape , as long as they were roughly symmetrical around the long axis . Within days , the reply from lan came : he 'd located a rock that was more or less ovoid , would that do ? It did , nicely . There was a similar crisis over the biphasic cladding for D.W. 's docker . The material used to sheathe spaceplanes had to function in the THE SPARROW 141 unimaginable cold of space as well as in the blast - furnace heat of entry and exit from an atmosphere . Military orders , being the most lucrative contracts , took precedence over civilian projects . Intense prayer , along with astute technical and diplomatic skill , was dedicated to this problem . Unexpectedly , the military government in Indonesia fell and the Indonesian Air Force 's order for a spaceplane was canceled , freeing up material for the private order that had been placed months earlier by Sofia Mendes on behalf of an anonymous group of investors . After a while it became hard to ignore how , against odds , the dice kept coming up in favor of the mission . The crew members went on with their training , their work unaffected by the waxing and waning of confidence , but they all experienced varying degrees of amazement . Even the Jesuits were divided . Marc Robichaux and Emilio Sandoz smiled and said , “
64805	64888	64162	64162	Marc	342	” while D. W. Yarbrough and Andrej Jelačić shook their heads in wonder . George Edwards and Jimmy Quinn and Sofia Mendes remained agnostics on the question of whether these events were minor miracles or major coincidences . Anne said nothing but as the months passed , it was increasingly difficult to resist the beauty of belief . AND SO , AS fate or chance or God would have it , nineteen months and twelve days after Anne began compiling her list with “
64895	64909	64162	64162	Marc	342	” she was able at last to cross off the wry final entry : “
64914	65362	64162	64162	Marc	342	” Unable to stomach even playground swings as a child , she was resigned to the idea that having the contents of her abdomen drift lungward would probably be sufficient to set off the space sickness that still afflicted 15 percent of all travelers , despite medical advances . Not completely pessimistic about her chances of avoiding this , she wore the antinausea transdermal patch that D. W. Yarbrough swore by , and swore at it when she could breathe again . On the whole , however , she was able to congratulate herself . Everyone had expected her to be frightened so , of course , she decided to confound their expectations by enjoying the ride . And she did . The vertical liftoff was incredibly noisy but there was very little sense of motion . Then there was the thrill of building to four Gs , of being plastered against her couch as they roared along toward Mach 1 , when suddenly the noise dropped off behind them . The sky quickly got blacker and blacker and then D.W. turned the afterburner off and she was thrown 142 MARY DORIA RUSSELL forward against the belts so hard she thought she 'd ruptured her heart . Then she caught sight of the moon and the turquoise rim of the Earth against the dense darkness , straight out the cockpit window ahead of her . As Asia rolled under them into a sunset of great and memorable beauty , Anne felt herself drift away from the couch and begin to float . It was then that she experienced an instant of unprecedented clarity , a moment of wholly unanticipated certainty that God was real . The sensation fled almost as quickly as it came but left in its wake the conviction that Emilio was right , that they were meant to be here , doing this impossible thing . She looked to him in astonishment , shaken , and was irrationally infuriated to see that he was asleep . They had been up about two and half hours when Sofia floated by to make a navigational sighting . Turning her head to follow the movement was probably what did it . Anne 's inner ears , not her guts , betrayed her . Without warning , her body revolted against its bizarre situation , and she spent the next few hours retching and blowing her nose . When it was over , she realized she was famished and , unfastening her straps , pushed off toward the cockpit , feeling like Mary Martin on a wire until she bumped into a bulkhead so hard that she exclaimed , “
65365	65368	64162	64162	Marc	342	” and then “
65371	65429	64162	64162	Marc	342	” without thinking . She glanced back at Emilio , hoping that she had n't disturbed him , but he opened his eyes and grinned greenly at her , and she realized that he 'd been awake all along and was just this side of blowing breakfast . D.W. chose that moment to holler back to them , “
65435	65864	65432	65432	anybody	928	” The effect of the question was immediate and impressive . At his own firm if garbled request , Anne left Emilio alone to cope with the revolting experience as she had , without a solicitous audience . She joined D.W. and Sofia for lunch , which featured an excellent vichyssoise , packaged in bags like toothpaste tubes . With her stomach settling and a surprisingly decent meal in her , Anne 's spirits rose all the way up to okay . This was sufficient improvement for her to decide morosely that even while suffering from the Fat Face , Chicken Legs syndrome that was affecting them all in zero G , Sofia at thirty - two looked better than Anne had on her wedding day , fresh - faced and twenty . Not even a radical redistribution of blood plasma and lymph was able to dim Sofia 's looks entirely , the fluid in her face smoothing it into an ivory oval , dark brows arched and tranquil over egg - shaped eyelids , the lips pursed in calm selfpossession : an emotionless Byzantine portrait . D.W. , on the other hand , was even more unsightly than usual . THE SPARROW 143 Beauty and the Beast , Anne thought , watching them work head to head over some navigational task . It was a friendship she found odd and pure and touching in a way she did n't quite understand . With Sofia , D.W. dropped most of his elaborate Good Ole Boy act and seemed to take up less of the oxygen in a room ; Sofia , for her part , seemed less wary in D.W. 's company , more at home in her skin . Remarkable , Anne mused . Who 'd have thunk it ? THERE HAD BEEN resistance to the escalation in Sofia 's involvement with the mission , not from the other crew members , but from the Father General 's office , which had been willing to employ her as a contractor but balked at her inclusion in the crew . It had taken D. W. Yarbrough 's direct intercession to bring her in and the Texan was pretty damned pleased with himself for pushing it through . For one thing , Sofia had turned out to be a natural pilot ; nerveless and precise , with a logical approach to complex systems , she picked up the skills from her instructors with the cool competence that once profited Jean - Claude Jaubert and now delighted D. W. Yarbrough . “
65880	65892	65432	65432	anybody	928	” D.W. declared to the Father General , and continued cheerfully , “
65923	66492	65920	65920	I	0	” But there was more to it than that . D.W. made no claim to saintliness , only to a certain talent for bringing people into their own - for finding God in them . A master of disguise himself , Yarbrough knew when he was looking at a facade . If nothing else was accomplished on this crazy - ass mission , he told himself first and the Father General last , he intended to take a shot at helping this one soul patch itself up and make itself whole . Long ago , John F. Kennedy proposed that America go to the moon , not because it would be easy but because it would be difficult , and that was the gift D. W. Yarbrough offered Sofia Mendes : the opportunity to do something so difficult that she 'd be stretched to her limits , feel her own possibilities , find something in herself to rejoice in . And if it was a shock that Sofia was as wise to his ways as he was to hers , he reckoned that might be to the good . For all his folksy cowboy shtick , Yarbrough was , at fifty - nine , a careful , competent leader whose slipshod personal style masked a relentless , fastidious attention to detail . Once an air squadron commander , he knew there were many things one 144 MARY DORIA RUSSELL could not control when engaged in battle , and that knowledge dictated an iron - willed insistence that what could be controlled must be brought to perfection . And in this , Sofia was his match . As the two generalists on the team , D. W. Yarbrough and Sofia Mendes had grappled with the coordination and supervision of the greatest voyage into the unknown since Magellan left Spain in 1519 . Together , they had gone over every detail of the mission , collecting and absorbing the results of the work of several hundred independent task forces , reconciling differences , making command decisions , insisting on additional thought , better solutions , more thoroughly considered plans . They had to allow for every imaginable contingency : desert heat , tropical rain , arctic cold , plains , mountains , rivers , and do it with as much overlap in equipment as possible , to minimize bulk . They studied foodstorage systems , considered possible means of overland transport , argued fiercely over whether they should bring coffee or learn to do without it , discussed the ecological impact of bringing seeds in hopes of establishing gardens , brainstormed about trade goods , shouted , fell out , made up , laughed a good deal and , despite the accumulated odds against such an outcome , came to be fond of each other . Finally the day arrived when they were ready to begin loading the asteroid for the trip . D.W. and Sofia ferried George Edwards and Marc Robichaux up to the rock first , so they could inspect and fine - tune the life - support system onboard the asteroid and stow the first shipment of supplies . Marc Robichaux , S.J. , was a naturalist and watercolorist from Montreal . Blond hair graying at forty - three , he remained one of those perennially youthful looking men , soft - spoken and gentle - eyed . “
66500	67242	65920	65920	I	0	” Anne pegged him , the kind of boy who was simultaneously a high school heartthrob and a teacher 's pet , adorable but with an obnoxious tendency to turn his papers in early and get A 's on them . Marc was in charge of the Wolverton tube plant colony and the tilapia tank , which would produce fresh food to supplement the packaged stuff they were bringing . George Edwards was responsible for the software control of the Wolverton tube as well as for the software and mechanical aspects of the allied air- and water - extraction systems . The two men had spent the last year learning each other 's specialties , Marc 's quiet carefulness a good balance for George 's exuberant tryanything approach to life . THE SPARROW 145 Next up were James Connor Quinn , twenty - eight , mission specialist for navigation and communications , and the musicologist Alan Pace , S.J. At thirty - nine , Father Pace was a willowy Englishman who gave the sleepy - eyed impression of someone who had seen it all and who quite possibly knew it all as well . It was a trait that worried D.W. ; Pace was a last - minute replacement for Andrej Jelačić , who 'd suffered a heart attack during a stress test . Andrej , still mourned , was a hard act to follow . But Alan was well qualified — a remarkable musician , if kind of a pain in the ass . Like many musicians , he had a precise and orderly mind and had , in fact , minored in mathematics . He cross - trained with Jimmy Quinn , an amateur pianist , and they had spent the months of preparation studying the growing collection of alien song fragments , along with the technical skills needed to navigate the rock to Alpha Centauri . That left Emilio Sandoz , forty , and Anne Edwards , who like her husband was sixty - four , as the last ones up to the rock . They had remained in Puerto Rico while the others dispersed for training . A new priest was assigned to take over Emilio 's work in La Perla , and he 'd shifted his effort to the clinic , where Anne supervised him in an accredited physician 's assistant course , with an emphasis on the kinds of medical emergencies they might face off Earth , without benefit of hospitals , pharmacies or elaborate equipment . For his part , Emilio once again be came Anne 's language teacher , this time using Sofia 's Al program to help Anne prepare for learning the Singers ’ language . Together night after night , they transcribed and studied the intercepted transmissions . They were handicapped by the utter lack of referents but picked out recurring phrases and accustomed themselves to the rhythm of the language . They had a fair amount of material to work from , as did Alan Pace . Once established , the reception pattern became reliable . By June of 2021 , most radio astronomers had returned to other projects and telescope operators simply turned toward Alpha Centauri in alternating 15- and 27 - day cycles , tuning in for what seemed to be regularly scheduled concerts . The music never lasted long , the signals falling off to noise after only a few minutes . The songs always differed from one another , although a theme was repeated once . Sometimes there was the call - andresponse pattern of the first song . Sometimes there was a soloist . Sometimes the music was choral . Most exciting , in some ways , was that individual Singers came to be recognized , after a time . Of these , the most compelling had a voice of 146 MARY DORIA RUSSELL breathtaking power and sweetness , operatic in dimension but so plainly used in hypnotic , graceful chant that the listener hardly noticed its gorgeousness except to think of beauty and of truth . This was the voice of Hlavin Kitheri , the Reshtar of Galatna , who would one day destroy Emilio Sandoz . IF THE ANTINAUSEA patches did not entirely eliminate space sickness , they did seem to limit its duration . Both Anne and Emilio were fine by the time D.W. called out , some twelve hours after liftoff , “
67247	67283	67244	67244	she	2065	” Floating cautiously toward the cockpit windows , they caught their first glimpse of the asteroid . Emilio , who 'd also been the recipient of George 's enthusiastic description , made a disappointed face . “
67293	67309	67379	67379	he	0	” Anne giggled and pushed off to return to her place in the cargo bay . “
67314	67325	67379	67379	he	0	” she said over her shoulder . She was grinning . “
67330	67344	67379	67379	he	0	” Emilio asked in a low voice , joining her in the back . “
67351	67355	67348	67348	you	2066	” D.W. ordered . “
67373	67374	67368	67368	I	0	” “
67394	67428	67386	67386	He	0	” Anne muttered , taking her position and fastening the straps that held her to her couch . Emilio , also buckling up , had not forgotten the look on Anne 's face . “
67438	67442	67379	67379	he	0	” he pressed . “
67450	67451	67379	67379	he	0	” “
67458	67473	67454	67454	I	0	” She was blushing but went on very quietly in tones of great propriety . “
67503	67512	67379	67379	he	0	” He put his hands over his mouth . “
67525	67526	67454	67454	I	0	” “
67536	67541	67534	67534	you	0	” Anne said severely . “
67561	67620	67542	67542	I	0	” THE DOCKING PROCEDURE went smoothly . D.W. and Sofia went almost directly to their quarters , having worked continually during THE SPARROW 147 the flight . Even Emilio and Anne were tired simply from being passengers , and despite the excitement of seeing the living quarters for the first time , neither of them protested being sent to “
67621	67932	67935	67935	you	2068	bed”—sleeping bags suspended in midair . While the newcomers slept , George , Marc , Alan and Jimmy moved the last few hundred items off the docker . A lot of thought had gone into the geometry of the storage areas ; it was hard to anticipate how the load would shift under acceleration . Indeed , all aspects of the living quarters had been planned for function in first weightlessness and later with a definite down , which would be aft , toward the engines , once they were fired . So everything had to be carefully secured before the first of two shakedown burns D.W. planned for the next day . The work took hours , which was partly why Jimmy Quinn was so late waking up the next morning , but only partly . Eileen Quinn once observed that getting Jimmy up for school was more like performing a resurrection than providing a wake - up call ; never a willing early riser , Jimmy hated mornings even in space . So when he floated into the common room after dealing with the aggravating complexities of weightless hygiene , he was ready to apologize for delaying the shakedown burn . To his surprise , Anne and George were still missing from breakfast , so he was n't the latest after all . He went about his business , silent as usual at that time of day , sucking down a tube of coffee and some lobster bisque he 'd discovered in the food bins . It was only after the caffeine began to work that he realized that everyone was kind of waiting for something to happen . He was about to ask D.W. what time the burn was scheduled for when the laughter from Anne and George 's room got noticeable and he turned to say , “
67942	68006	67935	67935	you	2068	” He meant it as an innocent question , but Emilio cracked up and D.W. put his hands over his face . Alan Pace was clearly trying very hard not to notice anything , but Marc was laughing and Sofia 's shoulders were shaking , although Jimmy could n't see her face because she 'd gone off to a corner of the galley . “
68010	68034	67935	67935	you	2068	” he started to ask again , but now Anne was audibly convulsed and then George 's voice rang out from their cabin . “
68051	68066	67935	67935	you	2068	” That set D.W. off , but Alan was still quite composed and remarked , “
68083	68109	68069	68069	I	0	” which Jimmy , in his morning fog , had to think about for a moi 148 MARY DORIA RUSSELL ment before he said vaguely , “
68122	68132	68133	68134	Ole George	315	” And then it began to dawn on him . “
68146	68250	68133	68134	Ole George	315	” D.W. commented , which made even Alan Pace laugh . But Marc Robichaux pushed off purposefully toward a storage cabinet and floated back moments later , smiling seraphically , a middle - aged Angel Gabriel holding a two - inch - wide roll of silver adhesive tape . This he delivered by cracking open the door to Anne and George 's room and holding it inside one - handed , the way one might deliver toilet paper to a discommoded guest . Meanwhile , Karl Malden 's sonorous TV voice , marred by a slight Spanish accent , called out to them , “
68261	68271	68272	68272	I	0	” Anne shrieked with laughter , but George yelled , “

68334	68376	68326	68326	her	484	” Jimmy called out from the bridge , a remarkably short time after they got under way . A ragged cheer went up . Knobby hands wrapped around a cup of coffee , D.W. leaned over the table and said archly , “
68397	68401	68402	68402	He	0	” Sofia smiled . “
68413	68427	68402	68402	He	0	” George snorted , watching the clocks and seeing the first discrepancies appear . “
68433	68444	68402	68402	He	0	” Anne asked brightly . There were boos and groans . “
68455	68467	68447	68447	I	0	” Emilio told her earnestly , as he set the table , “
68475	68580	68469	68469	I	0	” From the moment the engines were fired , they had full gravity , and it very quickly seemed normal to be inside an asteroid traveling toward Alpha Centauri , no matter how crazy the idea was objectively . The only indication that they were doing anything extraordinary came from two clock - calendar readouts mounted in the common room , which George was watching with open - mouthed fascination . The ship 's clock , handlabeled us , appeared normal . The Earth - relative clock , labeled THEM , was calibrated as a function of their computed velocity . с THE SPARROW 149 “
68583	68587	68588	68588	You	2077	” George said . “
68594	68607	68588	68588	You	2077	” The seconds were ticking by noticeably faster on the Earth clock . “
68615	68648	68608	68608	I	0	” Emilio said , glancing up at the clocks as he laid out napkins that Anne and D.W. had had a big argument about several months earlier . Anne 's logic was , “
68701	68702	68810	68810	our	2079	” “
68715	68744	68810	68810	our	2079	” had been D.W. 's counter . Finally , Sofia had pointed out that cloth napkins would weigh about eight hundred grams and were n't worth shouting about . “
68747	68751	68810	68810	our	2079	” Sofia said , “
68757	68775	68810	68810	our	2079	” And , thank God , Emilio thought , the women had won that argument , too . “
68790	68796	68810	68810	our	2079	” George explained again patiently , “
68889	68890	68999	68999	I	0	” “
68908	68912	68999	68999	I	0	” Emilio persisted . “
68919	68928	68999	68999	I	0	" Marc Robichaux called cheerfully from the galley . “
68935	68936	68929	68929	God	290	” “
68947	68951	68929	68929	God	290	” George said . “
68959	68996	68999	68999	I	0	” Anne announced as she and Marc brought out the first meal they 'd managed to cook normally in space : spaghetti with red sauce , a salad made with Wolverton veggies and reconstituted Chianti concentrate . “
69009	69010	68999	68999	I	0	” “
69019	69047	69013	69013	I	0	” Sofia said , taking a seat at the table . George leaned over to Anne and said something inaudible . Everyone smiled when she hit him . “
69057	69073	69013	69013	I	0	” Emilio retorted , ignoring the Edwardses , although Anne heard and seconded his sentiment . “
69083	69087	69013	69013	I	0	” Sofia admitted , “
69099	69131	69132	69132	Sofia	330	” Walking in from the bridge right on cue , Jimmy Quinn plummeted 150 MARY DORIA RUSSELL into a chair with comic suddenness . Even sitting , he towered over her . “
69139	69144	69145	69145	She	330	” Jimmy told them . “
69159	69160	69145	69145	She	330	” “
69180	69184	69163	69164	Miz Mendes	485	” D.W. said . “

69220	69225	69213	69213	we	2083	” George pointed out . “
69236	69237	69238	69238	You	485	” “
69247	69273	69240	69240	Anne	332	” Jimmy asked . Anne slapped him in the back of the head as she passed behind him to get the pepper from the galley . "
69297	69386	69392	69392	rangers	2084	” Alan Pace looked pained , but there was a chorus of hoots from the rest of them , as they settled around the table . They paused for grace and then passed the food around , laughing and ragging at one another . It was easy to feel they were all back at George and Anne 's place , having dinner . Pleased at how the group was gelling , generally , D.W. listened and let the conversation drift a while , before holding up a hand . “
69406	69507	69394	69394	rangerettes	2085	” The days were divided hour by hour . There would be free time for the four civilians , as D.W. called them , while the four Jesuits convened for the Mass , although anyone was welcome to join them . Classes were scheduled for three hours per day , nominal Sundays excepted , to give further depth to their training and maintain mental discipline , and to make sure that each crew member gained at least a passing knowledge of every other 's specialty . In addition , they were each scheduled for a daily hour of physical training . “
69515	69522	69523	69523	Nobody	793	" said the old squadron commander . “
69527	69657	69523	69523	Nobody	793	” There were routine maintenance operations and a rotating duty roster . There were clothes and dishes to be cleaned even in space , filters to be changed , plants and fish to be tended , hair and crumbs and unidentifiable orts to be vacuumed , even when traveling at a substantial portion of the speed of light toward God only knew what . But there would also be time for them to pursue private projects . The ship 's computers contained pretty close to the sum of Western knowledge in memory and a fair bit of non - Western data as well , so there was plenty to work with . And each day after lunch , D.W. proposed , they would work together on a joint project . “
69671	69685	69662	69663	Miz Mendes	485	” THE SPARROW 151 he said , aiming an eye in her direction . “
69702	69703	69686	69687	Father Pace	478	” “
69710	69725	69726	69726	I	0	” Sofia said , shrugging in response to the muted surprise around the table . "
69751	69765	69746	69746	Handel	486	” Another chorus of hoots and whistles broke out , punctuated by George 's “
69772	69779	69770	69770	Sofia	330	” and Anne 's blissful cry , “
69789	69817	69783	69784	another duelist	2089	” And D. W. Yarbrough grinned , beaming at Sofia like she was his own personal triumph . Which in some ways she was , Anne thought . “
69844	69868	69841	69841	they	4508	” Alan Pace pointed out , accurately if a trifle pedantically , trying to introduce some sort of serious discussion into the conversation . “
69881	69907	69841	69841	they	4508	” The clink of forks and dishes became audible in the quiet , and Anne was about to say something tart when Sofia Mendes spoke . “
69936	69958	69916	69917	Dr. Sandoz	291	” she said coolly , passing the salad to Jimmy , whose own mouth had dropped open at Pace 's comment . “
69992	70014	69979	69979	he	291	” She smiled pleasantly at Pace and watched him , brows raised expectantly , as she took another bite of spaghetti . “
70026	70048	70024	70024	Alan	337	” D.W. said comfortably , looking somewhere in the vicinity of Alan Pace but quite possibly at Sofia or Emilio instead . “
70061	70062	70056	70056	Al	337	” “
70072	70080	70081	70081	I	0	” Pace said , backing down smoothly . “
70087	70088	70085	70085	Sandoz	291	” “
70092	70174	70085	70085	Sandoz	291	” said Emilio a little stiffly , and he left the table carrying a plate of half - eaten food to the galley , evidently finished with his meal . HE WAS GRATEFUL to hear Anne pick up the conversation after he left , and put himself to work cleaning the pots . Intent on mastering his reaction , he was startled when he heard Sofia Mendes 's voice behind him , and that infuriated him further . 152 MARY DORIA RUSSELL “
70179	70195	70085	70085	Sandoz	291	” she asked levelly , reaching past him to put her dishes on the counter , “
70204	70231	70085	70085	Sandoz	291	” Emilio stopped scrubbing , not used to having his mind read , and rested his hands on the sink but resumed resolutely a moment later . “
70235	70245	70085	70085	Sandoz	291	” he said again , without looking at her . “
70258	70262	70263	70263	I	0	" she commented . “
70276	70336	70337	70337	I	0	” When he turned , she was gone . He swore violently under his breath and wondered , not for the first time , what had ever made him believe he might have the temperament of a priest . Finally , he straightened his shoulders , ran wet hands through his hair and walked back into the common room . “
70344	70363	70337	70337	I	0	” he informed the table formally , and having caught their attention with that , he assured them , “
70375	70432	70369	70369	I	0	” Through their surprised laughter , he begged pardon of Father Pace for taking offense and Alan reiterated his own regrets as well . Emilio took his place at the table again and waited until the others seemed engrossed in the after - dinner talk before he leaned slightly toward Sofia , sitting on his left . “
70436	70441	70369	70369	I	0	” he said quietly , “
70448	70450	70451	70451	I	0	” . “
70455	70477	70451	70451	I	0	” she said , echoing Alan Pace . Her eyes were sparkling , although she did n't look at him directly . “
70494	70605	70451	70451	I	0	” By the way , he 'd said casually in Sephardic Hebrew that would almost have passed for that of an Israeli native , it 's fourteen now . And if Jimmy Quinn and Anne Edwards and D. W. Yarbrough noticed Sofia 's face , because they were all alert to such things for different reasons , they also realized later that this was the last time Emilio Sandoz sat next to the young woman for nearly a year . ere 16 THE STELLA MARIS : 2031 , EARTH - RELATIVE IT WAS FIVE months into the voyage when Emilio heard a knock at his door after dinner one night . “
70608	70622	70451	70451	I	0	” he called quietly . Jimmy Quinn stuck his head into the room . “
70627	70628	70451	70451	I	0	” “
70635	70654	70451	70451	I	0	” Emilio sat up cross - legged on his bed and consulted an appointment book made of air . “
70659	70688	70691	70691	mine	2094	” Grinning , Jimmy came all the way in , closing the door behind him He looked around the little room , never having been inside it before . “
70693	70726	70691	70691	mine	2094	” he commented . A narrow bunk , a desk and chair , a terminal networked to the ship 's backup computer system . One difference : a crucifix on the wall . “
70749	70759	70743	70743	I	0	” The priest narrowed his eyes sensuously and shrugged . “
70772	70803	70765	70765	Latinos	2096	” But he turned down the light panels to make Jimmy more comfortable and flicked off the display on the ROM tablet he 'd been reading , setting it aside . “
70808	70825	70826	70826	Emilio	291	” Jimmy swiveled the chair away from the desk and sat looking around for a while . “
70828	70832	70826	70826	Emilio	291	” he said , “
70843	70848	70834	70834	I	0	" 154 MARY DORIA RUSSELL "
70856	70863	70852	70852	you	0	” Sandoz said a little warily . “
70872	70873	70852	70852	you	0	” “
70880	70890	70876	70876	you	291	” Jimmy suddenly burst out in a strangled whisper . “
70940	70952	70934	70934	she	330	” Emilio held up a hand , not wanting further details . “
70982	70983	70970	70970	you	309	” “
70988	71011	70970	70970	you	309	” Jimmy said , indignant because he had entertained a certain low - level expectation of life 's possibilities in that direction . “
71023	71024	70970	70970	you	309	” “
71029	71044	70970	70970	you	309	” Sandoz murmured , eyes sliding away , a smile flickering on his lips . “
71055	71089	71049	71049	God	290	” Jimmy laughed , wrapping his long arms around his head and contracting into a coil of mortification . Then his limbs uncurled and he looked back at the priest and asked frankly , “
71109	71140	71099	71099	I	0	” He expected something along the lines of Zenlike self - mastery and Rosaries , so he almost did n't understand when Emilio looked him in the eye and said , “
71148	71186	71146	71146	Jim	309	” At first , from the way it was said , with the intonation used to say good - bye to someone , Jimmy thought he was being dismissed . It took a moment to sink in . “
71198	71199	71204	71204	yourself	0	" “
71223	71224	71204	71204	yourself	0	” “

71267	71293	71265	71265	Jim	309	” For the first time since meeting the man , Jimmy felt he 'd crossed some line and he backpedaled as quickly as he could . “
71313	71320	71311	71311	Jesus	344	” Sandoz sighed , clearly uncomfortable . “
71366	71367	71353	71360	four hundred and ninety - eight of them	2100	” “
71374	71378	71379	71379	Elementary	489	” THE SPARROW 155 “
71395	71405	71390	71390	they	2101	” Before Jimmy had recovered , Emilio continued dryly , “
71427	71428	71429	71429	God	290	” “
71436	71437	71429	71429	God	290	” “
71449	71481	71429	71429	God	290	” Emilio ran his fingers through his hair , a nervous habit he had never been able to break . He let his hands fall and rested them on his knees . “
71519	71537	71540	71540	I	0	” Jimmy said nothing , so Emilio went on , voice quiet , face and eyes serious . “
71662	71691	71647	71647	we	2110	” Jimmy was quiet . He looked at the grave and unusual face of the man opposite him and when he spoke , he sounded older , somehow . "
71700	71732	71693	71693	you	2111	” Unexpectedly , Emilio 's face lit up and he seemed about to say something , but then the fingers combed through the dark hair again and his eyes slid away . “
71739	71912	71693	71693	you	2111	” was all he said . That NIGHT , As Jimmy lay in his bunk , he remembered a conversation with Anne one evening , back in Puerto Rico . He 'd been over at their place for dinner , and George , who always seemed to know when somebody needed to talk to Anne alone , went to bed early . It was three weeks after the first ET radio signal and Jimmy was depressed because everyone thought he 'd screwed up , or that Elaine Stefansky was right and he had been the victim of a hoax after all or , worse yet , was responsible for the hoax himself . He still saw Sofia quite often at work and he found himself uncomfortable with Emilio , wondering if they were lovers . He felt jealous and judgmental . And he was troubled by the mixture . 156 MARY DORIA RUSSELL mud , He beat around the bush for a while , but Anne knew what he was getting at . "
71925	71931	71915	71915	I	0	” she told him plainly . “
71969	71970	71952	71952	I	0	” “
71977	71987	71988	71988	He	2113	” Jimmy protested , as though that settled something . "
71993	71994	71999	71999	Jimmy	309	” “
72023	72027	71999	71999	Jimmy	309	” she demanded . “
72054	72101	72102	72102	We	2116	” He 'd been speechless at that . Anne had a directness that shocked him sometimes . She reached out for her glass of wine but only twirled the stem in her fingers , rotating it slowly , watching the burgundy glow in the low light . “
72130	72134	72135	72137	Most of us	2120	” she said . “
72180	72181	72172	72173	the lawyers	2123	” “
72193	72197	72184	72184	George	315	” She laughed . “
72219	72232	72215	72217	four different men	2125	” She watched him chew that over for a moment before continuing , “
72306	72307	72303	72303	your	309	” “
72312	72317	72303	72303	your	309	” he said quietly . “
72374	72382	72333	72333	Geology	491	” She flopped back against her chair . “
72411	72460	72404	72404	I	0	” She sat up straight , eyes focused somewhere outside the room , and Jimmy realized that even Anne did n't have all the answers and that was either the most comforting thing he 'd learned in a long DAS THE SPARROW 157 time or the most discouraging . “
72509	72516	72497	72497	he	896	” She shivered and slumped suddenly . “
72545	72650	72535	72535	Jim	309	” He had been taken aback by her vehemence . He thought that because she and George had been married so long , she 'd have high standards for everyone . A promise is a promise , he wanted her to say , so he could be angry with Emilio and hate his father for leaving his mother and believe that it would be different for him , that he 'd never lie or cheat or run out on his wife or have an affair . He wanted to believe that love , when it came to him , would be always and forever . “
72687	72692	72679	72679	I	0	” she said hurriedly . “
72753	72764	72765	72765	You	309	” She 'd looked a little sheepish then and admitted , “
72816	73187	73188	73188	Mendes	330	” He tried to think about all that , lying in his bunk . The divorce had been awful but then his mother found Nick , who loved her something fierce , and she was surrounded now by Nick 's kids , who thought the world of her . Things had worked out okay . And he thought about Emilio and Sofia . He knew very little about Sofia , only that she had lost her family in Istanbul during the U.N. quarantine and that she 'd gotten out by contracting to a broker . And , of course , that she was Jewish , which had thoroughly surprised him when he first found out . It did n't seem to bother her to be the only nonCatholic in the crew and she was respectful of the priests ' commitments , even if she had picked up a healthy dose of irreverence from Anne . Sofia , he realized then , had almost apprenticed herself to Anne during these long months , studying the nuances of affection : the quick hugs , the way to cup a chin in the hand or brush back the hair while making some acerbic , narrow - eyed , comic comment . And if Sofia was still pretty for- 158 MARY DORIA RUSSELL mal , it was clear that she was trying to recapture something that might have been hers by right if her life had been different . There was a promising warmth in her , which Jimmy had misinterpreted as an invitation . And now understood to be a simple offer of friendship . Well , he 'd blown that by looking for more than she was willing to give . So he adjusted his sights . If Sofia ever felt safe enough to offer friendship again , he decided , friendship would be enough for him . It could happen . When you live in close quarters for months , a certain amount of familiarity is unavoidable . And he wondered then how hard that was on Emilio . After that first real dinner onboard the Stella Maris , Emilio started calling everyone but Anne and D.W. by their last names . “
73190	73196	73188	73188	Mendes	330	” he 'd call out , “
73217	73244	73206	73206	I	0	” Sofia had persisted in Doctoring and Mistering everyone , but shortly after Emilio made his change , she took up the practice and it was , “
73263	73674	73254	73254	We	2145	” It gave them a way of speaking to and about each other without first names but without unnatural formality . It was probably Emilio 's way of turning the intensity down , to make the relationship more comradely . Even so , Jimmy was convinced , the sexual tension was still there . Where two people working together might have brushed hands during a task or stood closely , Emilio took pains to prevent contact : an awkwardly held wrist , a slight movement away . By chance alone , they might have sat together sometimes , and so it was significant that they never did . And for all the music and singing that went on in the Stella Maris , there had been no second song , no repetition of the heart - stopping intimacy of that evening in August . Emilio could be so casual and funny that you forgot sometimes that he was a priest and it came as a surprise when you saw his face during the Mass , or watched him doing something ordinary extraordinarily well , in that Jesuit way of making everyday labor a form of prayer . But even Jimmy could see that Emilio and Sofia would be good for each other and that their children would be beautiful and bright and beloved . And , following in the footsteps of centuries of compassionate Catholics before him , Jimmy now wondered why guys like Emilio had to make a choice between loving God and loving a woman like Sofia Mendes . He asked himself how he 'd feel if he found out someday that Emilio had kept his vow , always and forever . To his surprise , he leaned toward THE SPARROW 159 sad . And he knew that Anne , who used to be such a hardass about stuff like this , would approve . IT WOULD NOT have surprised Emilio Sandoz that his sex life was discussed with such candor and affectionate concern by his friends . The single craziest thing about being a priest , he 'd found , was that celibacy was simultaneously the most private and most public aspect of his life . One of his linguistics professors , a man named Samuel Goldstein , had helped him understand the consequences of that simple fact . Sam was Korean by birth , so if you knew his name , you knew he was adopted . “
73715	73720	73703	73703	I	0	” Sam told him . “
73757	74089	73754	73754	you	2150	" And Emilio realized that Sam was right . When wearing clericals , he did feel as though he had a sign over his head flashing NO LEGITIMATE SEX LIFE . Lay people assumed they knew something fundamental about him . They had opinions about his life . Without any understanding of what celibacy was about , they found his choice laughable , or sick . Oddly , it was men who 'd left the active priesthood to marry who were most eloquent about celibacy . It was as though , having given up the struggle themselves , they could more freely acknowledge the value of it . And it was in the words of one such priest that Emilio had found the clearest description of the Pearl of Great Price : a humaneness beyond sexuality , love beyond loneliness , sexual identity grounded in faithfulness , courage , generosity . And ultimately , a transcendent awareness of creation and Creator ... There were as many ways to lose one 's balance and sense of purpose as there were people who engaged in the struggle . He had himself gone through a time when avoidance of sex became so consuming he thought of nothing else , like a starving man who dreams of food . Finally he had simply accepted masturbation as a way station , for by then he 'd known men who made compromises that brought nothing but grief to the women who loved them or who dissolved loneliness in alcohol or , worst of all , who denied that they felt desire and split their lives : paragons in the light , predators in the dark . 160 MARY DORIA RUSSELL al . To persist , to find a way through and beyond the rigidity , the pitfalls and the confusion , Emilio had with painful care carved out an unflinching self - awareness and honesty . He found a way to live with the aloneness , to say “
74091	74415	73754	73754	you	2150	” when he asked himself if the Pearl would be worth the price he paid , day after day . Night after night . Year after year . Who could speak of such things ? Not Emilio Sandoz who , for all his facility with many languages , remained tongue - tied and inarticulate about the center of his soul . For he could not feel God or approach God as a friend or speak to God with the easy familiarity of the devout or praise God with poetry . And yet , as he had grown older , the path he had started down almost in ignorance had begun to seem clearer to him . It became more apparent to him that he was truly called to walk this strange and difficult , this unnatural and unutterable path to God , which required not poetry or piety but simple endurance and patience . No one could know what this meant to him . 17 NAPLES : JUNE 2060 SEEING SANDOZ ENTER the Father General 's office on the first day of the inquiry into the Rakhat mission , Johannes Voelker winced and gave thanks that this was all taking place in seclusion , away from Rome , far from the prying of the media , which feed off beauty and vice . How many of the others did this evil man corrupt , Voelker wondered bitterly , before they died ? Did he kill them , too , as he did the child ? Candotti and Behr had come in with Sandoz , Behr opening the door , Candotti pulling out a chair for him . Partisans certainly , under the spell . Even Giuliani seemed to make allowances , to coddle Sandoz , who had done incalculable damage to the reputation and material position of the Society of Jesus — Voelker looked up , and realized Giuliani was staring at him . “
74421	74442	74443	74443	Emilio	291	” Vincenzo Giuliani said pleasantly , warning Voelker wordlessly to govern his attitude as the three newcomers entered the room . “
74455	74456	74445	74445	I	0	” “
74462	74738	74739	74739	Gentlemen	4231	” Sandoz murmured . Slender and elegant in black , the dark hair longish now and outlined in silver , Emilio appeared less frail than he had been two months earlier . He was steadier on his feet , and his color was much better . What 162 MARY DORIA RUSSELL SWE ге his mental state was , Giuliani had no idea . Sandoz had hardly spoken since Felipe Reyes 's arrival , beyond courtesies and the shallowest of dinner - table conversations ; not even John Candotti had been able to draw him out . A pity , Giuliani thought . It would have been helpful to know what was going on in the man 's mind . The Father General moved from his desk and took his place at the head of the superb eighteenth - century table they would use during the hearings . The tall office windows were open to the June air , gauzy curtains moving prettily in the breeze . After a wet , gray spring , the summer promised to be cooler than usual , rainier , but quite enjoyable , Giuliani thought , watching the others settle into their places . Felipe Reyes left a chair in the corner of the office and hesitated before taking a seat , as though considering what position to take , relative to Sandoz . Voelker stood and pulled out the chair next to his own , putting Reyes directly opposite Candotti , who sat next to Emilio . Edward Behr took a seat near the windows where he could observe without being noticed , and where Emilio could see him . “
74741	74745	74739	74739	Gentlemen	4231	” Giuliani began , “
74829	74848	74849	74851	Some of us	2156	” Never able to speak from a sitting position , Giuliani rose and began to circle the office . “
74974	74988	74989	74989	You	2166	” Giuliani stopped his slow circuit of the room and looked at Sandoz . “
75002	75003	75000	75000	Emilio	291	” “
75006	75018	75000	75000	Emilio	291	” If Giuliani had expected a reaction , he was disappointed . “
75125	75133	75123	75123	Emilio	291	” Nothing . No reaction at all . “
75199	75223	75225	75225	me	0	” Sandoz continued to gaze out the windows . Irritated , Giuliani found himself reacting as though Emilio were a daydreaming graduate student . “
75238	75254	75255	75255	I	0	” Sandoz raised his eyebrows and turned his head to look at the Father General . “
75261	75290	75255	75255	I	0	” he said . The voice was even and firm , without a trace of insolence . Nevertheless , the eyes returned to the hills beyond the courtyard . “
75344	75352	75353	75353	Our	2176	” Again , there was no reaction . “
75383	75391	75392	75392	I	0	” Giuliani paused and his tone changed . “
75401	75413	75392	75392	I	0	” For the first time , Emilio Sandoz had a comment . “
75417	75431	75392	75392	I	0	” he said , almost to himself , still looking out the windows , “
75434	75448	75392	75392	I	0	” The words hung in the room , distant and thin as birdsong . “
75451	75463	75392	75392	I	0	” the Father General said at last , thrown off momentarily . “
75535	75574	75522	75522	you	291	” The Father General nodded to Voelker , who placed a tablet in front 164 MARY DORIA RUSSELL of Sandoz , the surface blanked . This , Voelker thought , is going to be exceedingly interesting to watch . “
75600	75623	75624	75624	We	2176	” Emilio looked up , and Giuliani was forced to stop and consider him for a moment . The puzzlement looked genuine . “
75679	75695	75788	75788	We	2176	” Voelker leaned over the table and brought up the display . Giuliani spoke again . “
75733	75787	75729	75729	you	291	” IT TOOK Emilio about ten minutes to make his way through the document . Toward the end , it was difficult to see clearly and he had to reread portions to be sure he understood , which was distressing . The Contact Consortium 's story did n't take him completely by surprise . “
75794	75799	75788	75788	We	2176	” John had said , “
75807	76060	75801	75801	we	2176	” But it was so absurd , so unfair , that he had n't taken in the implications , not really . The mind tries to protect you that way , he supposed . Until this day , he had not known what everyone else in this room , what the whole world had heard over twelve years earlier , nor could he have imagined how damning it would sound . And yet , it explained some things , and for that Emilio was grateful . He 'd begun to wonder if the headaches were because of a brain tumor , because there was so much that made no sense to him . This , at least , made the animosity and revulsion explicable : the way Isley and Wu looked at him , what they must have been thinking ... But he found other parts of the report both mystifying and an outrage . He tried again to make sense of it all and wondered if he 'd said something wrong or had been misunderstood . There is a clue here somewhere , Emilio thought , hoping to remember that later , when things were not so pressured . Then the headache tightened its grip and things began to flicker past his mind . Often in the past months , he had found himself suspended between screaming hysteria and black humor . Screaming , he had determined on the voyage back , only made the headaches more devastating . THE SPARROW 165 "
76066	76072	75801	75801	we	2176	” Emilio said at last . “
76078	76144	75801	75801	we	2176	" Black humor , on the other hand , made everyone else angry . Giuliani and Reyes were not amused . Voelker was outraged . John got the joke , but even he thought the timing was pretty poor . Emilio , his vision very distorted now , looked for Edward Behr but saw only that the man was no longer next to the window . “
76165	76177	76149	76149	someone	4267	” Voelker rapped , his voice hammering in Emilio 's ears . “
76214	76215	76221	76221	Voelker	301	” “
76231	76240	76241	76241	You	301	” It was John 's voice shouting back . “
76254	76383	76241	76241	You	301	" Then Felipe 's voice added to the din , and Emilio began to feel that his head would shatter , that the bones of his skull would go to pieces . He tried to escape from the yelling somehow , to go inside himself away from all this , but found no place to hide . For weeks , he 'd prepared singlemindedly , building walls brick by brick , deciding which questions to answer , which to turn aside and how . He 'd been sure he could get through the hearings , that he had some distance from everything now , but the carefully constructed defenses were crumbling , and he felt as flayed and raw and exposed as if it were all happening again . “
76388	76413	76414	76414	Emilio	291	” Giuliani 's words cut through the argument and the room fell silent abruptly . His voice was very mild when he spoke again . “
76424	76470	76414	76414	Emilio	291	” Brother Edward , having spotted the whiteness around the eyes that signaled migraine , was already on the way to Sandoz , hoping to get him out of the room before the vomiting started . But he stopped and waited for Emilio to speak . “
76479	76513	76476	76476	I	0	” Emilio said but the roaring in his head made it hard now to hear his own voice . And then everyone was shouting again , so probably no one heard him say , “
76520	76797	76476	76476	I	0	" He could feel Edward Behr taking him under the arms , pulling him to his feet . There was more talk , Edward 's voice close to his ear , but he did n't understand what anyone was saying . He thought it must have been John Candotti who half - carried him out of the office , and he tried to protest that there was nothing wrong with his legs . They managed to 166 MARY DORIA RUSSELL 15 get him into the stone - paved hallway before he lost control ; he was glad he had n't spoiled the carpets . When it was over , there was the sting of the injection and the brief terrible sensation of falling and falling even as he was being carried up the stairs . It 's all true , he thought as the drug took hold . But it 's all wrong . THE LANDER FROM the Magellan had set down near the village of Kashan , where the Jesuit party had lived for over two Rakhati years . The humans were met not by priests but by a terrifying mob of individuals they later learned to call Runa . The Runa were very big , very agitated , and Wu had expected to be killed on the spot . The Magellan party was about to retreat to their lander when a smaller person , whom they believed to be quite young , made her way through the crowd and went directly to Trevor Isley , whom she addressed , astonishingly , in English . She introduced herself as Askama and asked Trevor if he had “
76802	76857	76476	76476	I	0	” Askama seemed convinced that Isley was a relative of Father Emilio Sandoz — or Meelo , as she called him — a family member come to fetch the priest . When they asked about any others like Sandoz , Askama said that the other foreigners were gone but told them over and over , “
76863	77161	76476	76476	I	0	” that he was in the city of Gayjur now . Gradually the Magellan party understood that Askama meant to take them there . It seemed wise to go with her . They hoped that Sandoz would be able to explain the situation once they reached Gayjur . They went by river barge to the city . Along the route , Runa villagers shouted from the banks and , once , rocks were thrown . Trevor Isley , who happened to be wearing black , was obviously the target of that assault and it seemed clear that the missionaries had somehow poisoned the atmosphere , the very thing the Magellan crew had expected and feared . The city population was not openly hostile but the humans were watched silently as they made their way through the streets . Askama brought them to Supaari VaGayjur , whom they found to be something of a scholar . Supaari , they learned , had studied with Sandoz for a long while and his English was surprisingly good , although more heavily accented than Askama 's . He was also a member of the ruling Jana'ata , a person of apparent wealth and a gracious host , although Askama was dismissed rather abruptly . She was not allowed to stay with them but she was permitted to remain in the compound somewhere and the humans THE SPARROW 167 can saw her often . While Supaari confirmed Askama 's story that Emilio Sandoz had once been accepted as a member of his household , he informed the Magellan party that Sandoz no longer resided with him . Why ? they asked . Where was he now ? Supaari was indirect . Other living arrangements had been made for the Foreigner Sandoz that were “
77168	78333	76476	76476	I	0	” Supaari told them , and changed the subject . Over the next few weeks , the Magellan party was entertained lavishly , Supaari showing off his knowledge of their lingua franca and doing his best to answer their questions . At their request , he introduced them to other Jana’ata of influence . Everyone seemed cool and distracted , uninterested in trade or cultural exchanges . It became obvious that something ugly was brewing . Even the normally urbane Supaari became upset one afternoon , telling them that the Runa had attacked and killed several Jana'ata on a riverway near the city . Nothing like this had ever happened previously . Supaari assured them that relations between the Runa and the Jana'ata had always been good before . Supaari was of the opinion that the foreigners , as everyone called the Jesuits , were responsible for this . Balance had been lost . Traditions had been broken . The Magellan party brought up Sandoz 's name repeatedly , hoping for a more complete explanation of the situation from him , but Supaari seemed in no hurry to produce the man . In the end , it was not Supaari VaGayjur but the child Askama who located Sandoz and took Wu and Isley to him . Father Emilio Sandoz was found in a state of shocking degradation in what was obviously a whorehouse , where he was employed as a prostitute . His first act when found was to kill Askama , a child who had clearly been devoted to him . Upon questioning , the priest became hysterical and then refused to speak . The Jana'ata , preoccupied with larger affairs , pressed no charges and released Sandoz to the custody of the Consortium . Wu and Isley were not in a position to conduct any kind of investigation , so they decided to send Sandoz back to Earth and let the authorities there deal with him . The priest was transported to the Stella Maris , along with a cargo of remarkable gifts from Supaari VaGayjur , and the Magellan party turned their attention to repairing relations with the VaRakhati . In the weeks that followed , there were reports of additional Runa attacks on Jana'ata civilians near the city . Fearing that they would be caught up in the civil war that seemed imminent , Wu and Isley thanked Supaari for his hospitality and aid , and made plans to take their party 168 MARY DORIA RUSSELL back up to the Magellan , where they could either sit out the unrest or try a different region of the planet . Wu 's last transmission reported his group 's plan to head back toward their lander with an escort provided by Supaari Vagayjur . The Magellan party was never heard from again . And so it was that the only person to return from Rakhat alive was the priest and whore and murderer Emilio Sandoz , who had very much wanted to die . S 110 THE BREATHING HAD steadied now and Edward Behr knew that the medication had finally taken hold . It was much more effective if it could be taken orally when the headaches began . Edward tried to be alert to their onset , but Emilio hid a great deal . This time the pain had come screaming in with startling suddenness , and no wonder : to sit and read an indictment like that , minutely observed , the tiniest reaction analyzed for what clues might be given away . Edward Behr had seen this kind of thing before — the body punished for what the soul could not encompass . Sometimes it was headache , as with Emilio . Sometimes excruciating back pain , or chronic stomach trouble . You saw it in the alcoholics , often , drinking to dull the sensitivity , to mute the hurt . So many people buried the soul 's pain in their bodies , Edward thought . Even priests who , one would have thought , might have known better . Brother Edward had spent many hours sitting like this , watching Emilio sleep , praying for him . Of course , he 'd known the stories about Sandoz before being assigned to care for him . And he had tended the man 's body , was well aware of the injuries , which were not merely those to his hands and which silently told the sordid story . The original release of the information came when Edward Behr was married , before he ever thought of his present life or imagined he might meet one of the principals , but he 'd been interested , naturally . It was the news story of the century , after all . He recalled the teasing insinuations , the dramatic revelations , the scandalized reactions overshadowing the scientific and philosophical importance of the mission to Rakhat . Then there was , for the second time , a mysterious end to the transmissions and the long wait for Sandoz to return , bringing with him the only hope for some kind of explanation . Emilio 's very survival had been improbable , not to say miraculous . Alone for months , in a crude vehicle , navigated by only slightly less THE SPARROW 169 crude computers , he had been found in the Ohbayashi sector of the asteroid belt when a support ship investigated the automatic distress signal . By that time , he was so malnourished that the healed scars of his hands had reopened , the connective tissue going to pieces . He would have bled to death if the Ohbayashi people had n't picked him up when they did . Brother Edward realized that he might be the only one who believed wholeheartedly that it was a good thing Emilio had been found alive . Even John Candotti was ambivalent , if only because death seemed kinder and God was merciful . Edward did n't know what to think about the killing of Askama or the violence said to have been triggered by the Jesuit missionaries . But if Emilio Sandoz , maimed , destitute , utterly alone , had turned to prostitution , who could condemn him ? Not Edward Behr , who had some measure of the man 's strength and of what it must have taken to bring him to the state he 'd been found in , on Rakhat . Johannes Voelker , by contrast , was convinced that Sandoz was simply a dangerous rogue , gone to appalling excess in the absence of external controls . We are what we fear in others , Edward thought , and wondered how Voelker spent his time off . There was a quiet knock at the door . Edward rose silently and went into the hallway , pulling the door almost but not quite closed behind him . “
78336	78342	78366	78367	the Prograine	2191	" the Father General asked . “
78350	78356	78366	78367	the Prograine	2191	” Brother Edward said softly . “
78375	78376	78366	78367	the Prograine	2191	” “
78384	78411	78412	78412	He	2192	” Vincenzo Giuliani rubbed his face with both hands and let out a long uneven sigh . He looked at Brother Edward and shook his head . “
78428	78429	78424	78424	he	2192	” “
78438	78439	78424	78424	he	2192	” “
78445	78446	78447	78447	I	0	” “
78496	78563	78493	78493	I	0	” Brother Edward stopped . He 'd never spoken of this to anyone , not even Emilio , silent always in the early days when he 'd been too ill to move from bed . Perhaps the reports had been too clinical . Perhaps the Father General had n't understood what the sodomy had done , how desperate Sandoz must have been ... 170 MARY DORIA RUSSELL “
78568	78585	78586	78586	He	2192	” Brother Edward said plainly , and he looked at the Father General until Giuliani blinked . “
78605	78606	78607	78607	I	0	” “
78635	78736	78627	78628	Emilio Sandoz	291	” Giuliani walked to the doorway and hesitated before taking a step into the room . Most men were simple . They were looking for security , or power , or a feeling of usefulness or of certainty or competence . A cause to fight for , a problem to solve , a place to fit in . There were many possibilities but once you grasped what a man was looking for , you had the beginnings of understanding . At a loss , he studied the exotic face , halfhidden by dark hair and bed linens , and whispered , “
78749	78783	78747	78747	he	291	” It was a question he 'd pondered , one way or another , off and on , for sixty years . He did n't expect an answer , but he got one . “
78787	78792	78747	78747	he	291	” said Edward Behr , “
78797	78871	78872	78872	I	0	” Vincenzo Giuliani stared at the fat little man standing in the hallway and then at Sandoz , sleeping drugged against an assault on his own body , and wondered , What if that 's been it , all along ? IT WAS WELL into the night before Emilio stirred . He became aware that the small reading lamp by the chair was on and said quietly , his voice blurred with sleep , “
78891	78936	78937	78937	Emilio	291	” When he heard no response , he roused himself and turned over , rising onto an elbow , and saw not Edward Behr but Vincenzo Giuliani . Before Sandoz could spit out the words that were forming in his mind , Giuliani spoke . “
78943	78961	78937	78937	Emilio	291	” he said , the calm conviction in his voice concealing the calculated risk he was taking . “
79005	79030	79001	79001	I	0	” He watched the words sink in , rain to parched ground . So , he thought , that 's how he sees it . "
79077	79097	79055	79055	I	0	” The face closed to him , pride warring with an exhaustion that had nothing to do with sleep . “
79101	79108	79055	79055	I	0	” Emilio Sandoz said at last . “
79114	79211	79055	79055	I	0	” THE SPARROW 171 70 He did , and was about to go to his own room when he heard something that gave the Father General pause . It had been , simply , a gamble : a guess at how Sandoz might have felt . But hearing this , Vincenzo Giuliani required himself to remain in the hallway . Head against the wooden door , hands gripping the frame , he listened until the weeping was over , and learned the sound of desolation . 18 THE STELLA MARIS : SEPTEMBER 2039 , EARTH - RELATIVE “
79218	79225	79300	79300	Dealer	2198	” Emilio said . Sofia sighed . “

They 'd been circling at .25 G high above the plane of the Alpha Centauri system for weeks and were collectively bored witless . “

79496	79512	79486	79486	I	0	” Emilio offered , raising his voice slightly . He looked back at his cards . “
79521	79564	79486	79486	I	0	” Sofia and Anne folded . Alan tossed in two more Wolverton tube peanuts . George , taking a break , strolled buoyantly into the common room and reached over Anne 's shoulder to look at the cards she 'd thrown down . “
79568	79572	79573	79573	I	0	” he said . “
79579	79627	79573	79573	I	0	” She glared at him , but he planted a noisy kiss on the back of her neck . Quarter G was a lot of fun . Emilio added four peanuts and then four more and leaned back in his chair , squinting through imaginary cigarette smoke . “
79642	79661	79636	79636	I	0	” Alan ignored the Bogart impression and took the bet . Sandoz would play with anything or nothing . “
79673	79683	79684	79684	Sandoz	291	” Alan cried when they laid the cards down . “
79700	79707	79695	79695	you	291	” Emilio smiled delightedly and shrugged . “
79731	79757	79724	79724	ladies	2204	” The cards went out again , Emilio 's infectious merriment spreading around the table as they each looked at the hands he dealt them . “

79819	79891	79815	79815	I	0	” Alan pulled a card from the middle of Emilio 's hand and Emilio dealt himself a new one off the top of the deck . Predictably , he found it hilarious , and it was impossible to tell if he 'd just gotten four of a kind or busted a flush . When the bets came around to him , he pushed his whole pile of peanuts into the center . “
79901	79917	79918	79918	I	0	” Emilio urged . They laid their cards down again and Alan roared with indignation . “
79927	79934	79918	79918	I	0	” Emilio was practically crying now . “

80165	80172	80150	80150	you	2208	” they heard Jimmy say quietly . “
80177	80182	80150	80150	you	2208	” Emilio corrected him . “
80198	80224	80150	80150	you	2208	" He fell silent as Jimmy came into the common room . One by one , they turned to look and went motionless , waiting . “
80228	80234	80150	80150	you	2208	” Jimmy said , dazed . “
80258	80326	80150	80150	you	2208	” SINCE ROTATING THE asteroid at the halfway point , to turn the engines around and begin deceleration , they 'd stopped every two weeks to do periodic broad - spectrum imaging , engines off , and to listen for radio signals , which became relatively strong but remained strangely intermittent . As the Stella Maris passed out of the plane of the Alpha Centauri system , rising “
80328	80462	80556	80556	you	2214	” it in order to image the system at right angles , there was something far odder than interval to worry about : they lost the radio signals completely . It was generally unnerving , although the reactions ranged from Marc 's faith that everything would come right in the end to George 's palpable frustration at being unable to figure out what could account for it . But Emilio seemed strangely relieved , almost giddy , suggesting cheerfully that they turn around and go home , an idea that provoked howls of rejection . Now they all crowded around the bridge display as Jimmy ran the images back and forth in sequence , so they could see a point of light , varying in brightness from image to image , moving slightly . “
80465	80472	80150	80150	you	2208	” he THE SPARROW 175 said , “
80491	80525	80150	80150	you	2208	" Marc Robichaux , who 'd come out of the tiny gym when he heard the uproar , leaned around Jimmy and pointed to a smear , somewhat closer to the central sun . “
80532	80533	80537	80537	man	1619	” “
80539	80543	80537	80537	man	1619	” Jimmy said . “
80553	80554	80556	80556	you	2214	” “
80563	80585	80556	80556	you	2214	” Marc asked , towel hung over his neck , still breathing fast , but not from treadmill work any longer . “
80609	80654	80598	80598	We	2217	” A few minutes later , they could see the first planet directly , appearing now as a fuzzy ball , grayish and lumpy . And then the second , the one Marc had spotted , much larger and with two substantial companion bodies . “
80657	80672	80598	80598	We	2217	” George said softly , putting his arm around Anne and pulling her close . “
80675	80676	80556	80556	you	2214	” “
80687	80695	80598	80598	We	2217	” Marc said , with complete confidence . “
80730	80747	80598	80598	We	2217	” Anne looked at him , brows up , the question unasked . The naturalist smiled . “
80759	80823	80757	80757	Madame	509	” And then everyone was talking at once , congratulating Jimmy and George and Marc , discussing how long it would take to get to the planet with the moons , excitement swamping the funk they 'd been in as the sterile weeks had dragged by . The buzz of conversation halted when D.W. looked around for Emilio and then called out sharply , “
80834	80938	80832	80832	son	4260	” and pushed past the little crowd around the display , making his way through the common room benches and tables . He was n't quite quick enough to catch Emilio before he hit the floor . There was , at first , a burst of laughter because Emilio looked so comical , going down like a puppet with the strings cut , but in slow motion because of the low gravity . Alan Pace thought impatiently that he 'd only done it as a joke and was irritated as usual at the man 's habitual frivolity . Anne was right behind Yarbrough . "
80943	80958	80959	80959	He	2221	” she said matter - offactly as the laughter died and turned to consternation . “
80964	81047	80959	80959	He	2221	” She could have lifted Emilio off the floor herself ; at .25 G , he only weighed about thirty pounds . But intellectual equality aside , Anne 176 MARY DORIA RUSSELL Ng Edwards retained a certain deference toward male sensibilities , so she looked up at D.W. , intending to ask him to carry Emilio into his cabin for her . She was astonished to see that Yarbrough was trembling . Then it clicked and many things became clearer to her . “
81062	81226	81051	81051	you	309	" she called out in a slightly bored voice , to minimize the drama . D.W. opened the door to Emilio 's room and stepped out of the way as Jimmy went by , a giant Raggedy Andy carrying Emilio , who looked like a rag doll himself , limp in the big man 's arms . Anne gave the situation about three seconds ' consideration and then gave D.W. a firm and reassuring hug , brief but forthright , before squeezing past Jimmy into the little cabin . Jim left and she closed the door behind him . Emilio was already coming out of it . Anne could hear D.W. just outside the door , in full East Texas cry , making everyone laugh and steering the conversation back to the planet . The voices receded , and Anne looked back to Emilio , who was now sitting up , feet over the side of the bed , eyes wide and blinking . “
81230	81234	81235	81235	You	2224	” he asked . “
81273	81277	81258	81258	You	2224	" He nodded . “
81290	81304	81305	81305	Whoa	511	” He shook his head to clear it and his eyes widened again . “
81325	81366	81367	81367	I	0	” She was leaning against the bulkhead , arms crossed , watching him with a clinical eye but thinking about what she 'd just seen . He laughed a little and then sat still , letting his equilibrium reassert itself . “
81371	81376	81367	81367	I	0	” Anne said judiciously , “
81382	81383	81378	81378	you	2224	” "
81388	81389	81378	81378	you	2224	” “
81416	81474	81404	81404	you	2224	” She was n't as sarcastic as she might have been . In fact , she said this with a straight face , almost , with only a hint of insincerity to protect herself . He was silent for a long time , starting twice to say something and then stopping again . Finally , he said , “
81486	81518	81478	81478	I	0	” She slid down the wall , as controlled in her drop to the floor as Emilio had been boneless , and sat cross - legged , looking up at him . “
81530	81541	81526	81526	Anne	332	” He stopped again and THE SPARROW 177 laughed nervously . “
81563	81564	81565	81565	You	0	” “
81579	81580	81573	81573	you	0	” “
81622	81686	81606	81606	Anne	332	” There was another silence , as he tried to decide how much to tell her , where to start . She waited , watching him , pleased to see the color come back and then touched to realize that he was blushing . Self - disclosure is almost like sex , she thought . It is n't easy to bare your soul . “
81740	81752	81727	81727	you	0	” There was another pause , as the memories crowded in . “
81806	81807	81797	81797	I	0	” “
81813	81826	81797	81797	I	0	” she said , eyes steady . He took a deep breath . “
81882	81905	81861	81861	I	0	” Emilio watched her carefully , looking for shock or disappointment , but she did n't seem horrified or even terribly surprised . “
81916	81917	81861	81861	I	0	” “
81924	81928	81861	81861	I	0	” she laughed . “
81947	81948	81974	81974	you	0	” “
81953	81968	81974	81974	you	0	” He hesitated again , but finally the words began to come for him . “
82072	82083	82070	82070	Marc	342	” He hugged himself and leaned forward over his knees . “
82157	82180	82181	82181	I	0	” His voice was very low and he 178 MARY DORIA RUSSELL made a face that said , Who are they kidding ? “
82198	82199	82193	82193	Elvis	403	” "
82208	82214	82215	82215	I	0	” Anne cried , offended . “
82229	82246	82215	82215	I	0	” He laughed and moved back onto the bed so he could sit against the wall . “
82356	82371	82339	82339	I	0	” Anne remembered the playfulness . It had seemed so strange at the time . “
82484	82485	82462	82462	someone	4267	” “
82510	82511	82487	82487	D.W.	377	” “
82603	82604	82590	82590	God	290	” “
82623	82624	82611	82611	I	0	” “
82664	82758	82654	82654	God	290	” He ran out of steam for a while , and Anne let him stare and gather his thoughts . Then he looked at her and smiled and climbed down off the bed to sit next to her on the floor , their shoulders touching , knees drawn up . The difference in their ages seemed less important than their near equality of size . Anne had a flashing memory of sitting like this with THE SPARROW 179 her best friend when they were both thirteen , telling secrets , figuring things out . “
82887	82914	82870	82870	Anne	332	” he said , voice dropping to a whisper and his hands , resting on his knees , opening , as though to reach for something , “
82967	82992	82993	82993	You	0	" She waited to see if he had more but when he fell silent , she decided to take a shot in the dark . “
83009	83014	83015	83015	You	0	” she asked him . “
83075	83083	83069	83069	him	1061	" He looked at her , astounded . “
83153	83181	83147	83147	God	290	” He snorted , half in disbelief and half in astonishment , and put his hands over his mouth for a moment and then pulled them away . “
83198	83199	83194	83194	God	290	” “
83206	83214	83194	83194	God	290	” Anne said , shrugging and smiling . “
83222	83263	83215	83215	You	0	" And saying it , she was pleased to hear how natural it sounded , how unburdened . He reared away to look at her and his eyes softened , doubts set aside for a truth he was sure of . “
83269	83274	83264	83267	Madre de mi corazón	516	” he said quietly . “
83280	83322	83275	83278	Hijo de mi alma	517	" she replied , as softly and as certain . The moment passed and they were back together , staring at their knees , com- 180 MARY DORIA RUSSELL panionable again . Then the spell was broken , and he laughed . “
83336	83337	83339	83339	you	0	” “
83343	83350	83339	83339	you	0	” she asked , eyes wide . “
83354	83415	83339	83339	you	0	” Emilio got to his feet and offered Anne a hand up . She stood easily in the low gravity but held onto his hand a moment longer than necessary , and they embraced and laughed again because it was hard to decide whose arms should go over whose shoulders . Then Anne opened the door and called out wearily , “
83425	83429	83418	83418	somebody	4110	” Jimmy yelled , “
83451	83456	83444	83444	I	0	” And Sofia said , “
83466	83505	83444	83444	I	0	” but she and Jimmy already had a meal ready for him . And things went back to as normal as they could get , inside an asteroid , above Alpha Centauri , looking for signs from God . “
83517	83526	83527	83527	Sumbitch	518	” D. W. Yarbrough muttered at one point . “
83537	83768	83527	83527	Sumbitch	518	” Nobody dared laugh . During the past two weeks , D. W. Yarbrough and Sofia Mendes had worked nonstop , dropping the Stella Maris closer and closer to the planet . The process was dangerous and frustrating , and D.W. was sometimes startlingly short with people . Everyone was irritable , and after D.W. finally managed to wrestle the ship into an acceptable orbit , they went into freefall and things got even worse . For over three years , they 'd worked like mules to be here , within sight of the planet they had come to investigate . In a small place together for over eight months , they 'd gotten along remarkably well , but there were accumulated tensions and anxieties and a grinding restlessness that did not surface in shouting matches very often but was evident in sudden silences as people swallowed retorts . Of all of them , D.W. was most likely to snarl , dressing people down for minor mistakes or lapses in attention to detail or ill - timed remarks . Emilio , no worse than any of the others , nevertheless caught hell most often . When Yarbrough laid down the law to reestablish the regular order , Emilio threw out a little joke about the disordo irregularis . D.W. stared at Sandoz until his eyes dropped and then told him , “
83779	83833	83834	83834	You	2279	” Which shut Emilio up for days . Another time , after the Father Superior left everyone feeling ruffled by issuing a string of abrupt commands at breakfast , ending with a particularly sharp decree THE SPARROW 181 aimed at Sandoz , Emilio tried to take the sting out of it by asking , “
83841	84125	84126	84126	They	2280	” Yarbrough just about took his head off with a barrage of very rapid , very colloquial , heavily accented Spanish no one else could follow , but whose meaning they could guess at by the effect . Anne might have approached D.W. to see if she could provide a little perspective on the general topic of overcompensation but within an hour , she herself was on the receiving end of a lecture , having forgotten to cover a salt shaker , whose contents had then drifted out of the holes over several days . D.W. opened the storage cabinet and a miniature snow squall resulted . There was an unpleasant exchange and George got involved , and it took both Sofia and Jimmy 's intervention to calm everyone down . Eventually the adjustment to zero G was over , nausea had abated all round , the ordo was back in place , and everyone was once again working with reasonable efficiency . They did a full survey to begin with , launching several satellites to encircle the planet , collecting atmospheric and geographic data . At this distance , the patterns of ocean and landmass were clear . The overall impression was of greens and blues running to purple , broken by areas of red and brown and yellow , frosted with the white of clouds and very small ice caps . It was n't Earth but it was beautiful , and it had a powerful pull on their emotions . The biggest surprise was the sudden reappearance of the radio signals . Whenever they moved between the moons and the planet , the ship received bursts of incredibly strong radio waves . “
84133	84163	84126	84126	They	2280	” Jimmy realized as he sketched the system and worked out what was happening physically . There was no indication of any indigenous life or colonies on the moons . “
84174	84175	84166	84166	they	2280	” “
84179	84224	84225	84225	They	2280	” George announced triumphantly one afternoon , floating into the common room from his cabin , where he 'd been going over the atmospheric data . It came to him out of the blue , when he was n't thinking about the radio problem . “
84236	84237	84225	84225	They	2280	” “
84242	84276	84225	84225	They	2280	” Jimmy yelled from the bridge . He shot into the common room , hooked a hand around a support pole like a gigantic orangutan , and friction - spiraled to a halt . “
84295	84296	84297	84297	You	2283	” “
84304	84324	84297	84297	You	2283	” Anne called from the galley , where she and Sofia were getting lunch ready . 182 MARY DORIA RUSSELL “
84350	84354	84333	84333	you	2284	" George explained . “
84395	84396	84365	84365	you	2284	” “
84421	84435	84471	84472	a doctor	1771	” Jimmy said , crowing with happiness at clearing up that little mystery . “
84441	84450	84471	84472	a doctor	1771	” Anne asked . Jimmy gaped at her . “
84480	84500	84474	84474	Jim	309	" George broke up but Jimmy , too young for the first Star Trek , did n't get it . “
84524	84528	84471	84472	a doctor	1771	” Jimmy began . “
84532	84549	84471	84472	a doctor	1771	” D.W. cut in , as he pushed himself into the common room from the bridge . “
84571	84599	84602	84602	you	2294	" Then he was gone , disappearing into his cabin , leaving people shaking their heads and muttering . Anne watched him go and rotated toward Sofia . “
84607	84608	84602	84602	you	2294	” “
84616	84620	84602	84602	you	2294	” Sofia smiled . “
84672	84673	84674	84674	I	0	” “
84679	84727	84674	84674	I	0	” Anne said , impressed by the analysis , which she considered precisely one brick shy of the full load , and wondered if Sofia was unaware or very discreet . Discreet , Anne decided . Sofia did n't miss much and she knew D.W. very well . “
84738	84739	84740	84740	He	377	” “
84779	84794	84760	84760	D.W.	377	” Anne closed her eyes , sagging as much as one could while weightless . “
84818	84905	84799	84799	I	0	” Sofia was surprised to see the woman look every day of her age for once , and for a dreadful moment she thought that Anne would burst THE SPARROW 183 into tears . Sofia reeled her in for the kind quick embrace she had received in the hundreds from the older woman . It was not an impulsive act , for hardly anything Sofia Mendes did was impulsive . But now , at last , she 'd soaked up enough affection to give some back . “
84915	84932	84908	84908	Sofia	330	” Anne said , laughing and taking a quick swipe at her eyes with a sleeve . “
84955	85118	84910	84910	I	0	” THE NEXT MORNING was as tense and demanding as anything Anne had ever sat through . Or floated through , in this case . She meant to follow it all but found herself distracted and savagely restless during a long debate about whether the lander fuel would combust properly in the atmosphere of the planet . The air was breathable , and the weather was stinking hot but would n't kill them . There were a lot of thunderstorms and cyclones going on at any given time , which could have been due to the season or to the amount of energy pouring into the system from the three suns . Marc 's presentation was thorough but frustrating . He could delineate boundaries between ecological regions but who knew what that predominantly lavender stuff was ? It might be something like a deciduous forest in summer or something like grasslands or something like conifer forest or even an enormous algae mat . “
85123	85131	84910	84910	I	0	” Marc pointed out with a shrug , “
85140	85205	84910	84910	I	0	” Terrain was easier for him to interpret with confidence . Open bodies of water were sometimes plain , but Marc warned that they could be confused with swampy areas . Tidal zones were remarkably extensive — not surprising with multiple moons . There were obvious oxbow lakes and many river systems . He believed there were areas of cultivated land but told them , “
85219	85289	84910	84910	I	0	” Let 's just go , Anne thought as Marc droned on . Fuck this shit . Let 's just do it . Pack some sandwiches , get in the goddam lander , and go down and throw open the doors and just live or die . Startled by her own fretfulness , she looked around and saw it in the others as well , but then Marc said , “
85300	85319	84910	84910	I	0	” There was an exhalation and a murmur all around . Marc outlined an area near the coast . “
85388	85468	85375	85375	I	0	” There were other regions showing features that suggested cities elsewhere on the continent , but they 'd come because of the music , so there was no serious discussion of landing near those . Despite this unanimity , an argument broke out over how close to the transmitter city they should approach initially . Alan Pace was astonished that there was any question at all . He wanted to make contact with the city inhabitants immediately and directly . “
85537	85538	85539	85539	You	2318	” “
85564	85569	85539	85539	You	2318	” D.W. asked Alan . “
85579	85589	85570	85570	We	2315	” Emilio suggested thoughtfully . Even Alan cracked up . “
85616	85626	85603	85604	Human beings	1071	” Jimmy Quinn said , ignoring Emilio but grinning . “
85644	85645	85647	85647	you	2323	” “
85653	85665	85647	85647	you	2323	" Anne asked , joining the discussion for the first time . “
85701	85702	85703	85703	They	2320	” “
85711	85730	85703	85703	They	2320	” Sofia and Jimmy said simultaneously . Everyone laughed , and Anne shrugged and nodded , admitting defeat . “
85757	85768	85703	85703	They	2320	here”—George pointed to a lake in the mountainous area near the city—“is
85838	85861	85824	85824	I	0	” - - - - THE SPARROW 185 Marc was very much disturbed by this line of reasoning and appealed directly to D.W. “
85916	85922	85926	85926	you	2330	” D.W. turned to Anne . “
85939	85941	85942	85942	George	315	” . “
86004	86008	86009	86009	Alan	337	” she said . “
86056	86060	86039	86039	you	337	” Pace grimaced . “
86065	86066	86039	86039	you	337	” "
86071	86075	86039	86039	you	337	” Anne said . “
86102	86103	86076	86076	I	0	” “
86123	86127	86039	86039	you	337	” Marc said . “
86142	86213	86214	86214	I	0	” . The discussion went on for hours but ultimately D.W. decided that they would attempt to land in an area that appeared to be uninhabited , with supplies for a month 's stay , to assess the conditions and plan their next move . And later they all realized that in the end , the decision to go had once again come down to the words of Emilio Sandoz . “
86241	86246	86214	86214	I	0	” he 'd said . “
86265	86276	86249	86249	I	0	” Then , to his own surprise , he added , “
86294	86521	86288	86288	He	290	” And if the statement was not entirely unconditional , only Anne noticed . 19 LANDFALL , RAKHAT : OCTOBER 13 , 2039 , EARTH - RELATIVE THE FOLLOWING DAYS were the worst they 'd experienced , physically and mentally . From the tonnage of stored matériel , they had to select the equipment , clothing and food that seemed likely to be most immediately useful and stow it on the lander . The asteroid systems had to be locked down for their absence . The radio transceivers had to be set up to receive , encrypt and relay their reports to Earth . The onboard computers had to be left in a condition to be accessed remotely . D.W. double - checked everything , catching errors , correcting mistakes . Having nursed a certain amount of resentment about his highhandedness , Anne began to reassess . D.W. was right to have gotten a grip on things when he did . Even with his steadying influence , the activity verged on frantic toward the end . They were all secretly scared they 'd forgotten something or made a mistake that would result in some disaster or get someone killed . So when D.W. finally called a halt and brought them all together , there was a sense of being pulled back from the brink of hysteria . “
86534	86539	86524	86524	you	2335	” he told them . “
86604	86620	86599	86599	we	2336	" D.W. smiled into the eyes of all his tired people , one by one . “
86675	86719	86662	86662	God	290	" THAT NIGHT , ANNE left George and pushed herself across the commons to D.W. 's door . She knocked softly , not willing to wake him if he was asleep but wanting to talk to him in private if he was n't . “
86724	86729	86730	86730	Anne	332	” he called quietly . “
86732	86745	86730	86730	Anne	332	” There was a little delay , and then the door opened . "
86761	86796	86753	86753	I	0	" She smiled and tried to find a place to float that felt properly situated . A paper for some graduate student , she thought . Maintenance of Culturally Based Distancing Norms in Zero G. “
86831	87123	86816	86816	you	2335	” In the silence that fell , Anne watched him work it through in his mind . There was no place in history at stake here , no plan to record this event . No reporters , no photography or AV feed to the nets . From a culture gone mad with documentation , publicity , broadcast , narrowcast and pointcast , where every act of public and private life seemed to be done for an audience , the voyage of the Stella Maris had begun in privacy , and its mission would be carried out in obscurity . Jesuits being as they are , there would be no mention of who set foot on this planet first , not even in the internal report relayed back to the Father General , who ever he might be when the news got back . Even so , as their leader by nature and by Order , it was D.W. 's risk to take and his privilege to claim . If Emilio Sandoz had first suggested this endeavor , it had nevertheless become D. W. Yarbrough 's mission . No one had worked harder or longer , no one had given more thought to it or slaved over its details more single - mindedly . Anne knew that and she honored it . He looked up at her after a long time , almost bringing both eyes into alignment with the intensity of his gaze . She could see him making one of the decisions involved in discussing this with her and she maintained a strict neutrality , so as not to influence him . When he spoke , his voice was as empty of accent as his face was naked of defense . “
87143	87152	87158	87158	D.W.	377	” he said and then hesitated before saying , “
87156	87157	87158	87158	D.W.	377	” “
87176	87195	87166	87166	I	0	” It 's okay , she wanted to say . He 's easy to love . I understand . “
87216	87231	87232	87232	I	0	” She cleared her throat then , embarrassed even to have said that word . “
87245	87251	87234	87234	you	377	” D.W. waved that off . “
87279	87308	87277	87277	Anne	332	” He looked at her to see if she accepted that and then rubbed his eyes , red - rimmed and bloodshot in his pale , disheveled face . “
87346	87347	87350	87350	D.W.	377	” “
87358	87362	87350	87350	D.W.	377	” Anne cried . “
87391	87434	87384	87384	You	377	” D.W. laughed , and she decided against hugging him but held out her hand . He took it and , to her complete astonishment , brought it to his lips and kissed it , looking crookedly at her the whole time . “
87441	87461	87438	87439	Miz Edwards	523	” he said , Southern and gallant as he could be , dressed in sweats and floating in midair . “
87467	87591	87465	87465	y’hear	2347	” ALL OF THEM , in their own ways , prepared that night both for death and for a kind of resurrection . Some confessed , some made love , some slept exhausted and dreamed of childhood friends or long - forgotten moments with grandparents . They all , in their own ways , tried to let their fear go , to reconcile themselves to their lives prior to this night , and to what might come tomorrow . For some of them , there had been a turning point that now seemed justified , however painful the decision might have been . For Sofia Mendes , a way to make peace with what , even now , she could only think of as “
87597	88460	87595	87595	Jaubert	388	” For Jimmy Quinn , the end of worry that he was wrong to leave his mother , and right to claim his life as his own . For Marc Robichaux and Alan Pace , there was a sense that they had lived their lives the right way and confidence that God had recognized their artistry as the prayer they had always meant the work to be , and there was hope that He would let them serve Him now . THE SPARROW 189 For Anne and George Edwards , for D. W. Yarbrough and Emilio Sandoz , this voyage had given meaning to random acts , and to all the points where they had done this and not that , chosen one thing and not another , to all their decisions , whether carefully thought out or ill considered . I would do it all again , each of them thought . And when the time came , each of them privately felt a calm ratification of those reconciliations , even as the noise and heat and buffeting built to a terrifying violence , as it seemed less and less likely that the plane would hold together , more and more likely that they 'd be burned alive in the atmosphere of a planet whose name they did not know . I am where I want to be , they each thought . I am grateful to be here . In their own ways , they all gave themselves up to God 's will and trusted that whatever happened now was meant to be . At least for the moment , they all fell in love with God . But Emilio Sandoz fell hardest of all , letting his fear and doubt go almost physically , his hands opening as everyone else clutched at controls or straps or armrests or someone else 's hand . And when the mind - numbing scream of the engines diminished and then fell off to a silence almost as deafening , it seemed only natural that he should move into the airlock and open the hatch and step out alone , into the sunlight of stars he 'd never noticed while on Earth , and fill his lungs with the exhalation of unknown plants and fall to his knees weeping with the joy of it when , after a long courtship , he felt the void fill and believed with all his heart that his love affair with God had been consummated . Those who saw his face as he pushed himself to his feet , laughing and crying , and turned back to them , incandescent , arms flung wide , recognized that they stood witness to a soul 's transcendence and would remember that moment for the rest of their lives . Each of them felt some of the same dizzying exultation as they emerged from the lander , spilling from their technological womb wobbly and blinking , and felt themselves reborn in a new world . Even Anne , sensible Anne , allowed herself to enjoy the sensation and did n't spoil it by speculating aloud that it was probably plain relief at cheating death combined with a sudden drop in blood pressure to the brain , consequent to the reversal of Fat Face , Chicken Legs . None of them , not even George who had no wish to believe , was entirely exempt from transcendence . 190 MARY DORIA RUSSELL THERE FOLLOWED DAYS of rapture and hilarity . Children on a field trip to Eden , they named everything they saw . The eat - me 's and the elephant birds , hoppers and walkies , the all - black Jesuits and the allbrown Franciscans , scummies and crawlers , hose - noses and squirreltails . Little green guys , blue - backs and flower - faces , and Richard Nixons , which walked bent over looking for food . And then black - andwhite Dominicans , to round out their collection of orders . And turtle trees , whose seed pods resembled turtle shells ; peanut bushes , whose brown blossoms were double - lobed ; baby 's feet , with foliage soft as rose petals ; and pig plants , whose leaves were like sows ' ears . The niches were all there . Air to fly through , water to swim in , soil to burrow under , vegetation to exploit and hide behind . The principles were the same : form follows function , reach high for sunlight , strut your stuff to attract a mate , scatter lots of offspring or take good care of a precious few , warn predators that you 're poisonous with bright colors or blend into the background to escape detection . But the sheer beauty and ingenuity of the animal adaptations were breathtaking and the gorgeousness of the plant life staggering . Anne and Marc , their eyes informed by their study of evolution and Darwinian selection , were beside themselves with delight in everything they saw . They said it with different inflections but they both exclaimed repeatedly , “
88469	88500	87595	87595	Jaubert	388	” And long past the point when the others wanted to drop exhausted to the ground , Anne 's voice or Marc 's could be heard calling softly but urgently , “
88514	89412	89413	89413	Sandoz	291	” until they were all sated with beauty and novelty and astonishment . D.W. had come in over ocean and flown low as a drug smuggler over what might as well be called treetops . He spotted a clearing and made a snap decision to land there rather than further on , in the plain Marc had chosen . Surrounded by the tall , heavy - stemmed vegetation that filled the niche of trees , they felt safe and unobserved . If the weather promised to be mild , they slept in the open , weaponless , too ignorant or trusting to worry about major carnivores or aggressive poisonous things . They had tents and took shelter during the sudden rainstorms , but they were frequently drenched . No one cared . The nights were so brief and the days so warm , they dried out quickly and napped in the re SO THE SPARROW 191 leaf - filtered sunlight , drowsing in the warmth , contented and lazy as dogs by firelight . Even dozing , they were suffused with their surroundings . The windborne fragrance of a thousand plants as varied as stephanotis , pine , skunk cabbage , lemon , jasmine , grass , but unlike any of them ; the heavy dank odor of vegetation decayed by another world 's bacteria ; the oaklike musky bass notes of the crushed herbs they lay on overwhelmed their ability to perceive and categorize such things . As three dawns and three dusks came and went , the sounds of the long day changed , from chorus to chorus of trilling , shrieking , whirring things . Sometimes they could match the sound to the animal that made it : a shrilling that belonged to the lizardlike creatures they called little green guys , an amazingly loud rasping noise that was made by a small scaly biped staking out its territory in the forest 's ground litter . Most often , the sounds were full of mystery , as was the God that some of them worshiped . THEIR FORAYS BEYOND the clearing were limited , made in pairs , kept always within sight and call of the lander and encampment . But after so much time together , they all broke D.W. 's rule once in a while and sought time alone , to come to grips with the experiences , to think and absorb and then move ahead again , into wonder . So Sofia was not surprised when she found Emilio sitting alone , his back against a boulder that had formed in layers , like sandstone . His eyes were closed . He might have been sleeping . There are moments , she thought later , when reality seems to shift suddenly , like shards of colored glass in a kaleidoscope . Looking down at Sandoz , seeing him at rest and unaware , she realized , simply , that he was no longer young . And was astonished at the wave of feeling that swept over her . He was always working or laughing or studying , and his intensity and humor made him seem ageless . She knew something of his life , having worked with him , and recognized him as one of her own kind : an eternal beginner , starting over and over in a new place in new circumstances , with new languages , new people , a new commission . They had this in common : the continual rushed confrontation with change , the feeling of being hothoused , forced to bloom early , the exhausting exhilaration of doing the unreasonable not just adequately but well and with grace . 192 MARY DORIA RUSSELL Flexible , then , and adaptable but not authoritative . He felt himself to be a skilled tradesman , perhaps , doing work to order . She wondered if he had ever given an outright command in his life and thought that if she depended on Emilio Sandoz to teach her a language , she might never even suspect that the imperative mood existed . All this , perhaps , contributed to what she had always perceived as a certain unfledged quality , made more striking by a willingness to submit to authority , odd in a grown man of intelligence and energy , but part and parcel of Jesuit formation . Not childish , but certainly childlike . And yet , she could see now the skin of the eyes pleating , the mouth bracketed by deeper grooves than she had noticed the first time she 'd seen him . Half his life , she thought , given to this jealous God of his . And perhaps a third of my own life given to Jaubert , she thought , and before that ... Who am I to judge a life misspent ? She drew closer to him , the humus and herbage cushioning her step and absorbing the sound of her approach , and dropped silently almost to her knees . Her hand was drawn to a lock of hair near his face , silver against the black , and she reached out tentatively , as though to touch a butterfly . Sensing her movement , his eyes opened , and she took cover behind Anne 's unwitting lessons . “
89415	89431	89413	89413	Sandoz	291	” she cried , lightly seizing his hair and pulling it playfully toward his eyes , “
89444	89487	89436	89436	You	291	” He laughed . She smiled back and stood again , looking around , as though there were something , anything in this world , that was of more interest to her now than the man she 'd just turned away from . “
89497	89507	89490	89490	You	291	” When she said nothing , Emilio asked again , “
89514	89515	89490	89490	You	291	” “
89525	89546	89518	89518	I	0	” Sofia gazed at the forest , her hands gesturing toward it all , before turning to look at him . “
89556	89583	89584	89584	I	0	” She was aware , always , that he knew what she had been and wondered with fresh interest how this shadowed his thoughts of her . “
89591	89596	89584	89584	I	0	” Emilio told her . “
89628	89629	89609	89609	I	0	" “
89636	89641	89609	89609	I	0	” she told him . “
89661	89672	89673	89673	You	0	” THE SPARROW 193 Emilio regarded her through narrowed eyes . “
89692	89697	89686	89687	the women	847	” he demanded suddenly . “
89735	89803	89724	89724	I	0	” He had been praying , Sofia realized , not sleeping . His voice was light and ironic , but she had seen his face that day and knew he meant it . She tried hard to identify the feeling , to name what swept her , and realized that it was tenderness . This is impossible , she thought . I ca n't let this happen . “
89809	89813	89815	89815	you	0	” he continued , "
89822	89826	89815	89815	you	0	” She blinked . “
89845	89846	89839	89839	Anne	332	” “
89852	89861	89839	89839	Anne	332	” he asked , getting to his feet . “
89886	90023	89877	89877	Anne	332	” They walked back to the encampment , bantering amiably on the way . But she was careful to keep her distance , and believed she gave no sign that she had at last taken up a burden that Emilio had long carried for both of them , without her conscious knowledge . Sofia Mendes , after all , had survived by sealing off emotion , her own and others ' . It was an old skill , employed in times past to protect herself and now honorably exercised on behalf of another . I am Mendes , she thought . Nothing is beyond me . ANNE LOOKED UP from her notebook as Emilio and Sofia joined the others . It 's happened , Anne thought , but she turned immediately to the work at hand . “
90032	90048	90049	90049	Marc	342	” she told the group sitting in a circle in front of the lab tent . “
90115	90129	90130	90130	Emilio	300	” Jimmy laughed but looked a little nervous . Anne was n't joking . "
90150	90154	90132	90132	you	300	” Anne continued . “
90168	90174	90164	90164	you	300	” ear 194 MARY DORIA RUSSELL “
90181	90194	90164	90164	you	300	” Emilio asked , sitting on the ground between Alan and George . “
90226	90238	90164	90164	you	300	” she said seriously , looking at Jimmy the whole time , “
90271	90272	90273	90273	You	0	” “
90289	90293	90273	90273	You	0	” Jimmy said . “
90308	90312	90273	90273	You	0	” Anne agreed . “
90369	90408	90356	90356	Alan	337	” He did n't , and they began with a small amount of roasted little green guy because the animals were abundant and easy to catch . Everyone watched as Jimmy got ready to take his first bite . “
90426	90431	90356	90356	Alan	337	” Marc instructed him . “
90444	90445	90356	90356	Alan	337	” “
90453	90458	90356	90356	Alan	337	” Jim told them . “
90469	90489	90356	90356	Alan	337	” There were moans , as he knew there would be , and he beamed happily at the response . “
90499	90541	90546	90546	you	309	” Marc told him . Jimmy sucked the rest of the meat from the little pair of legs . And was shouted at by Marc , to everyone 's surprise , since they did n't know Marc had shouting in him . “
90559	91057	91058	91058	Alan	337	” Sheepish , Jimmy apologized but , despite the risk he took , suffered no ill effects , either immediately or at any time during the next twentyfour hours . Like the rainwater they 'd drunk , little green guy meat seemed harmless . They went on from there , with Jimmy taking the first taste of each item they sampled . If it did n't make Jimmy sick , Alan and D.W. tried it next and then George and Marc , and finally Sofia , with Anne and Emilio acting as controls , recording the foodstuffs they tested and tracking the responses , ready to do what they could if someone reacted badly . Marc 's protocol was observed to the letter after Jimmy 's rashness . If anyone exA THE SPARROW 195 perienced the tingling or numbing that indicated potential poison , the item was described carefully for the record and not tried again . If there was no numbing and if the item was reasonably palatable , then they 'd take another small bite and swallow . Wait fifteen minutes and try some more . Then finish a good - sized sample an hour later and hope to be as lucky as Jimmy had been . They rejected many things on the basis of taste . Most of the leaves they tried were too bitter , and many of the fruits were too sour , although one that tasted great gave even Jimmy the shits . Alan broke out in a rash once , and Marc threw up after one meal . But slowly they compiled a list of things that did n't seem to damage them , even if it was still unclear whether or not they were deriving any useful nutrients from the food . That would require time and a gradual shift from a diet made up primarily of food brought from Earth to one comprising native elements . THE PLANET SEEMED so welcoming and their contentment was so thorough that the weeks came and went without a return to the Stella Maris . Having admired its extravagant beauty , warmed by its suns , sheltered by its forest , at least potentially nourished by it , they began to feel at home on this planet whose name they did not know and to trust its benevolence and welcome . The first and only sign of trouble was simply that Alan slept late one morning . In the relaxed discipline of those days , D.W. let him but finally decided to roust him out for breakfast . First with humor and then with concern , he jostled Alan with a toe and then shook his shoulder . Getting no response , he called to Anne , who knew from the tenor of his voice to bring her kit . Shouting Alan 's name , talking to him constantly , she surveyed his condition . Airway open . Breathing and heartbeat irregular . “
91078	91102	91071	91071	we	2359	” she said in what she hoped was a mother 's voice as D.W. began the ritual anointing . Pupils dilated and fixed . "
91106	91110	91071	91071	we	2359	” she yelled . “
91118	91239	91071	91071	we	2359	” Anything . Try to engage him , find a way into wherever he was now , pull him back . Pulse thready . In the ER , she 'd have had a team all over him , intubating , charging the paddles . Death , in her experience , was never peaceful . Her training was to resist until flat - line , and beyond . After fifteen minutes , someone took hold of her shoulders and drew her back , ending the CPR . Understanding , she gave 196 MARY DORIA RUSSELL Pace up , but sat and held his limp hand until D.W. took it from her and crossed it over Alan 's still and cooling chest . “
91246	91259	91240	91240	You	337	” she said . D.W. nodded numbly : they had to know . "
91276	91277	91278	91278	I	0	” "
91284	91416	91417	91417	She	2360	” George , who knew more than he liked about Anne 's work , lashed together a waist - high table for her and curtained off an enclosure , using tarps from the lander . Then he filled containers of water from a nearby creek so she could rinse off as she worked , as well as all the tough , black plastic showerbags , setting them in the sunlight to warm the water , knowing that she 'd want to scrub when she was done . Sofia finally roused herself from shocked immobility and went to help George as he took down his and Anne 's tent and set it up again , away from the rest of the encampment . He thanked her and explained quietly as they worked , “
91456	91483	91485	91485	you	2362	” Emilio , meanwhile , helped lift Alan 's body onto the crude table and stayed behind after D.W. , Jimmy and Marc left the enclosure . “
91491	91500	91485	91485	you	2362	” he asked , willing but already pale . “
91503	91512	91485	91485	you	2362	” she said abruptly . Then she softened . “
91546	91761	91763	91763	her	2365	” But not bodies like this . Not fresh ; not friends . It was , in fact , among the worst , the most distressing things she 'd done in a lifetime of grisly experience . And it was among the most futile . Hours later , she made the corpse presentable and called for the priests , who dressed it in vestments and wrapped it in another tarp , the plastic shroud garishly yellow , as inappropriate and unacceptable as the death it concealed . It was dusk by then . Sitting around the small fire , the others listened to the nearby sound of falling water as Anne showered the blood and brains and excrement and stomach contents from her body , soaped away the smell , and tried unsuccessfully to put the images and sounds from her mind . When she emerged , wet - haired but dressed and apparently composed , it was too dark for D.W. to see how tired she was and how upset . He thought , perhaps , that this was not difficult for her , that she was a professional , hardened , unsusceptible to breakdown . So he called her to the fire and asked her the results . THE SPARROW 197 V au- “
91766	91782	91763	91763	her	2365	” George said , putting an arm around Anne and turning her toward their tent . “
91788	91789	91763	91763	her	2365	” “
91796	91806	91763	91763	her	2365	” Anne said , even though it was n't . “
91821	91822	91828	91828	Doctor	4685	” “
91840	91845	91828	91828	Doctor	4685	” Marc suggested quietly . “
91851	91856	91828	91828	Doctor	4685	” Anne said patiently . “
91890	91922	91828	91828	Doctor	4685	” She turned again to go to the tent , to lie down with George and to remind herself in his arms that she was alive , and glad of it . “
91928	91932	91828	91828	Doctor	4685	” Emilio asked . “
91952	92022	92023	92023	Emilio	300	" They were taking refuge in the concrete . Anne realized that . Faced with death , people looked for reasons , to protect themselves from its arbitrariness and stupidity . She 'd been up for twenty hours . So had the others , but they 'd only waited . Anne put her hands on her hips and stared at the ground , breathing deeply to control the anger . “
92025	92032	92023	92023	Emilio	300	” she said softly but precisely , “
92118	92143	92163	92163	He	2367	” she said , working hard now to keep her voice steady , for the brain had been the hardest to retrieve and inspect , “
92179	92207	92173	92173	People	4085	" She turned to walk away again , looking for someplace to sit down and cry by herself , and nearly screamed when she heard D.W. ask , “
92242	92243	92232	92232	Anne	332	" “
92249	92271	92272	92272	You	300	" she asked , rounding on him . He stopped talking , startled by her tone out of his own reverie . “
92289	92361	92282	92282	God	290	” She said it to shock D.W. , to shock them all , to shut them up , and she was bitterly glad to see it work . She saw D.W. stop in midsentence , motionless , his mouth open slightly , Emilio wide - eyed , Marc blinking 198 MARY DORIA RUSSELL with the violence of it , the way she 'd turned his habitual cry of faith against them . “
92372	92380	92370	92370	gentlemen	4231	” Anne asked with a flat stare . “

92475	92494	92497	92497	he	2374	” It was Jimmy 's voice . She felt George take her arm and she shook him off . “
92551	92567	92547	92547	they	2380	” Her voice broke on the words and that made her more furious and desolate . “
92634	92649	92650	92650	He	2383	” George held her while she wept through her rage and told her quietly , “
92662	92682	92658	92658	Nobody	793	” and she knew that , but for the moment it did feel like it was all her fault . “
92689	92708	92687	92687	George	315	” she whispered , wiping her nose on her sleeve , and trying to stop crying and failing . “
92721	92747	92711	92711	I	0	” She turned helplessly toward Jimmy and Sofia , who had moved to her side , but it was the priests Anne was looking at . “

They all still had secrets to keep , but some childhood memories were shared and Marc Robichaux 's were among them . Marc was not one of those guys who knew he wanted to be a priest when he was seven , but he was very close to it . Diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia at five , he was lucky enough to be a Canadian THE SPARROW 199 when universal health care was available . “
92909	92914	92807	92807	God	290	” he told them . “
92950	93037	93079	93080	My grandmother	2387	” His mother did her best , but she had other children to care for . So it fell to his paternal grandmother , perhaps compensating for the way her son had deserted the family under cover of the stress of Marc 's illness , to sit by his bed , to regale him with stories of old Quebec , to pray with him and assure him with perfect confidence that a new kind of operation , an autologous bone marrow transplant , would cure him . “
93064	93068	93079	93080	My grandmother	2387	” he admitted . “
93097	93098	93079	93080	My grandmother	2387	” “
93105	93109	93101	93101	you	0	” Sofia asked . “
93130	93131	93101	93101	you	0	” “
93144	93167	93136	93136	I	0	” he told them , through a burst of surprised laughter . And when they refused to believe this , he insisted , “
93178	93413	93168	93168	I	0	” The talk moved on to sports at that point and never came back to Marc 's childhood . But Sofia was not far wrong , although it was almost ten years before Marc Robichaux found a focus for his clear sense that life was God 's gift , to give or take . His grandmother 's rosary had come with him to Rakhat , and so did his conviction that all life is fragile and evanescent , that God alone endures . And yet he knew that Anne would find such an answer to her unanswerable question inadequate and unsatisfying . Why ? she would ask . Why does it have to be that way ? In the brief hours before the first of the Rakhati dawns , as Marc kept vigil with Alan 's body , he watched Jimmy Quinn moving quietly from tent to tent , listening , agreeing , finding common ground and relaying messages . There had been times , Marc knew , when each of the mission members had thought privately that Alan Pace might cause trouble , but none of them had anticipated that it would come about like this or that Anne of all people would drive a wedge into the group . Finally , with the night noises quieting and the orange sun 's chorus tuning up , Jimmy came across the clearing toward Marc . “
93419	93424	93414	93414	Blessed	2391	” Marc said quietly . “
93431	93461	93462	93462	George	315	” Jimmy stared toward what they called east because that 's where way . 200 MARY DORIA RUSSELL daybreak began , and ticked off the summaries with his fingers . “
93547	93610	93538	93538	Job	533	” Unexpectedly , Marc smiled . The orange sunlight filtered through the eastern edge of the forest and reached his silvering hair , restoring to it the golden tint of his youth . He had been a spectacularly beautiful child and even in middle age , the lovely lines of his face softening , he could be a treasure to look at . “
93636	93745	93634	93634	oui	2395	” Jimmy waited to see if Marc had anything more to say but Robichaux turned away . The beads of an antique rosary began again to slip through his fingers in the gentle rhythm only Marc , and perhaps God , could hear . THERE WAS A brief , tight discussion before the Requiem about whether they should bury Alan , cremate the corpse or take it back to the Stella Maris . The issue was whether or not the bacteria in his body would contaminate the local ecosystem . To Anne 's considerable relief , she and Marc found themselves on the same side of the argument . “
93760	93769	93755	93755	we	2396	” Anne said , voice husky from crying . “
93797	93798	93634	93634	oui	2395	” “
93803	93808	93634	93634	oui	2395	” Marc Robichaux added . “
93821	93881	93809	93809	Our	2396	” So a grave was dug and the yellow tarp 's shrouded contents were carried to its edge . The Liturgy of Resurrection was begun , and when the time came , Marc spoke of Atan Pace and of the beauty of his music and the delight he had taken in hearing whole songs only a few weeks earlier . “
93891	93895	93809	93809	Our	2396	” Marc said . “
93919	93929	93930	93932	The Jewish sages	2401	” He paused and looked at Sofia before continuing . “
94014	94015	93991	93991	Himself	290	” ”
94076	94097	94098	94098	he	342	“ It is the human condition to ask questions like Anne 's last night and to receive no plain answers , ”
94101	94164	94098	94098	he	342	“ Perhaps this is because we ca n't understand the answers , because we are incapable of knowing God 's ways and God 's thoughts . We are , after all , only very clever tailless primates , doing the best we can , but limited . Perhaps we must all own up to being agnostic , unable to know the unknowable . ”
94190	94277	94181	94181	Marc	342	“ The Jewish sages also tell us that God dances when His children defeat Him in argument , when they stand on their feet and use their minds . So questions like Anne 's are worth asking . To ask them is a very fine kind of human behavior . If we keep demanding that God yield up His answers , perhaps some day we will understand them . And then we will be something more than clever apes , and we shall dance with God . ”
94283	94296	94308	94309	Felipe Reyes	379	“ REYES , RELAX ! WE'RE in far less danger out here . "
94297	94307	94308	94309	Felipe Reyes	379	“ Far less is not the same as none , ”
94350	94363	94346	94346	Reyes	379	“ I was a lot happier when we could see the shoreline . ”
94441	94466	94467	94469	the Father General	754	“ This is the first day , including Sundays , in almost ten years that I have n't been in at least four meetings , ”
94507	94546	94495	94496	Felipe Reyes	379	“ It 's getting so I always make a sincere Act of Contrition before I go into a meeting . Statistically , it 's a good bet I 'm going die during one . Prepare to come about . ”
94590	94603	94604	94604	Giuliani	294	“ I 'm sorry it has to come at Emilio 's expense , ”
94607	94622	94604	94604	Giuliani	294	" but I 'm delighted by the chance to get out on the water . "
94623	94632	94633	94633	Reyes	379	“ You love this , do n't you , ”
94639	94672	94673	94673	he	379	“ Oh , yes . Yes , I do . And I am , by God , going to take a year off when I 'm eighty and sail around the world ! ”
94688	94774	94775	94775	They	2416	“ Sailing is the perfect antidote for age , Reyes . Everything you do on a sailboat is done slowly and thoughtfully . Most of the time , an old body is entirely capable of doing whatever needs to be done while you 're cruising . And if the sea is determined to teach you a lesson , well , a young back is no more capable than an old one of resisting an ocean , so experience counts more than ever . Coming about . ”
94843	94875	94831	94831	fishermen	2420	“ I tried to get Sandoz to come out here with me yesterday . Thought he 'd enjoy it . He looked at me like I was suggesting a suicide pact . ”
94876	94886	94896	94896	he	379	“ Probably scared to be out in a boat , ”
94903	94921	94896	94896	he	379	“ But you guys are from an island ! How can you be scared of the sea ? ”
94937	94967	94968	94968	Felipe	379	“ Easy . Hurricanes and pollution . Toxic tides and sharks . Nothing like living on an island to convince you that land is the correct place to be . ”
94983	95008	95009	95009	he	379	“ I never learned to swim , myself . I doubt that Emilio ever did either . Too late now , in any case , ”
95017	95027	95032	95032	him	379	“ You wo n't need to swim , Reyes , ”
95045	95108	95034	95034	He	754	“ Tell me about Emilio . I knew him as a kid — he was one of my secundi during formation , you know . God 's best beloved , we primi used to call him . Only a matter of time until he leads a revolt of angels ... Had to be the best at everything , from Latin to baseball . ”
95153	95185	95186	95186	Reyes	379	“ And later , I knew him by reputation , as an academic . Brilliant in his field , I understand . What was he like , as a parish priest ? ”
95209	95229	95235	95237	the same man	2424	“ He was a good priest . Very likable guy . Young . Great sense of humor . Athletic . ”
95361	95371	95372	95372	Felipe	379	“ Did you ever hear about the Basura Brigade ? ”
95376	95389	95372	95372	Felipe	379	“ No . What was that ? Basura means garbage , right ? ”
95390	95546	95349	95351	The Father General	754	“ Right . That was typical Sandoz , now that I think of it . It was at the beginning , when he first got back to La Perla . The neighborhood - well , it was a slum , you understand . A lot of squatters . There was a sort of shanty town in the east end . And it was never incorporated , so there was no garbage pick up . People threw stuff into the sea or dumped it over cliffs . Emilio just started picking trash up in the streets . Bags and bags of it . And he 'd carry it up to Old San Juan and leave it in front of the Edwardses ' house so the city would haul it . He got in trouble with city council , but the Edwardses claimed it was their trash . So they got away with it for a while . "
95547	95551	95552	95552	Felipe	379	“ Coming about . ”
95573	95663	95552	95552	Felipe	379	“ At first the kids would just kind of follow Emilio around — he was terrific with kids . Anyway , they 'd follow him around , and he 'd hand them each a bag , and pretty soon there 'd be this whole parade of little kids with big bags of garbage , trailing up the stairs behind Emilio and leaving this incredible pile of trash in front of the Edwards place . And that was a very fancy tourist neighborhood , so there were tons of complaints . ”
95664	95700	95349	95351	The Father General	754	“ Let me guess . The city finally decided it was better to pick up the THE SPARROW 205 garbage in the neighborhood than to make an issue about it with a very telegenic priest . ”
95701	95761	95762	95762	Giuliani	294	“ You bet . I mean , he could be so charming , but you just knew he would keep bringing the garbage up until hell froze over . And he pointed out that the kids were doing something constructive and let the council figure out that those same kids could be picking pockets in San Juan , so ... ”
95768	95829	95762	95762	Giuliani	294	“ You know , I have never been able to reconcile the stories I hear about Emilio with the man I know . The last word I 'd choose to describe him is charming . He was the grimmest man I ever met , in formation . Never smiled . Worked like a dog . And just ferocious about baseball . "
95830	95855	95856	95856	He	294	“ Well , you know , Latino boys still aspire to the F 's . They want to be feo , fuerte y formal . ”
95868	95913	95856	95856	He	294	“ Ugly , strong and serious . The macho ideal . I imagine Emilio took a lot of abuse as a kid because he was small and good - looking , so he made up for it by being very serious , very correct . ”
95914	95981	95982	95982	Giuliani	294	“ Well , I 'd have said sullen and hostile rather than serious and correct . You know , I 'm not certain I 've ever seen him smile . Or heard him say more than three words in a row . When I hear people describe him as charming or funny , I think , Are we talking about the same person ? Coming about . ”
95996	96014	96015	96015	He	379	“ And then I hear he does impressions and magic tricks , he 's great with kids — ”
96028	96059	96025	96025	he	379	“ I have always found him stiff and standoffish , but he has an uncanny ability to make friends ! Candotti and Behr would walk over hot coals for him . "
96060	96072	96073	96073	Felipe	379	“ Can I sit on the other side of this thing ? ”
96076	96083	96073	96073	Felipe	379	“ This arm 's getting tired . ”
96084	96106	96112	96112	he	379	" Sure . You want me to take it ? I sail alone quite a bit when I get the chance . ”
96122	96139	96140	96140	he	379	“ No . Actually , if I can just switch sides , I 'll be fine , ”
96171	96184	96185	96185	he	379	“ I 'm beginning to see the attraction of this sailing business , ”
96188	96207	96185	96185	he	379	“ This is my first time in a boat , you know . When did you start sailing ? "
96208	96240	96267	96267	Giuliani	294	“ When I was a kid . My family had a thirty - two - foot cutter . My dad had me working out celestial navigation problems when I was eight . ”
96241	96250	96185	96185	he	379	“ Father General , may I speak frankly ? ”
96260	96266	96267	96267	Giuliani	294	“ You know , Reyes , ”
96277	96307	96267	96267	Giuliani	294	“ one thing I hate about this job is that everyone always asks permission to speak frankly . Say whatever you want . And call me Vince , okay ? ”
96334	96345	96331	96331	he	379	“ When did you get your first pair of shoes ? ”
96356	96371	96331	96331	he	379	“ I have no idea . When I was a toddler , I suppose . ”
96372	96431	96331	96331	he	379	“ I got my first pair of shoes when I was ten . Father Sandoz got them for me . When you were growing up , was there ever any question about your going to school ? I do n't mean college . I mean , did anyone ever imagine that you would n't go to high school ? ”
96432	96441	96442	96442	Giuliani	294	“ I see what you 're driving at , ”
96446	96466	96442	96442	Giuliani	294	“ No . There was no question at all . It was absolutely assumed that I would be educated . ”
96467	96471	96472	96472	Felipe	379	“ Of course , "
96526	96554	96493	96493	He	379	“ I mean , if you had n't gone into the priesthood , you 'd have been a banker or a hospital administrator or something , right ? ”
96555	96577	96493	96493	He	379	“ Yes . Possibly . Something like that , perhaps . The import business or finance would have come pretty easily . ”
96578	96623	96624	96626	The Father General	754	“ And you 'd feel perfectly entitled to be whatever you wanted to be , right ? You 're smart , you 're educated , you work hard . You deserve to be who you are , what you are , where you are . ”
96641	96710	96632	96632	he	754	“ You know what I 'd be , if I were n't a priest ? A thief . Or worse . I was already stealing when Emilio took an interest in me . He knew about some of it , but he did n't know I was already busting into cars . Nine years old . I would have graduated to grand theft auto before I was thirteen . ”
96711	96726	96727	96727	Giuliani	294	“ And if D. W. Yarbrough had n't taken an interest in Emilio Sandoz ? ”
96731	96738	96727	96727	Giuliani	294	“ What would Emilio have been ? ”
96739	96743	96744	96744	Reyes	379	“ A salesman , ”
96756	96801	96744	96744	Reyes	379	“ Black tar heroin , out of Mexico via Haiti . Family tradition . They all did time . His grandfather was assassinated in prison . His father 's death touched off a minor gang war . His brother was killed for skimming profits . ”
96848	96851	96852	96852	Felipe	379	“ Look , ”
96889	96931	96932	96932	He	379	“ there are still times when the thief I started out to be feels more authentic to me than the priest I 've been for decades . To be pulled out of a slum and educated is to be an outsider forever- ”
96972	96974	96992	96992	Giuliani	294	“ I ”
97004	97020	96999	97001	the Father General	754	“ So you memorize the rules and you try not to expose yourself to humiliation . ”
97021	97024	96992	96992	Giuliani	294	“ Yes . ”
97025	97045	96999	97001	the Father General	754	“ And you are stiff and formal in direct proportion to how completely you feel out of your element . ”
97046	97049	96999	97001	the Father General	754	“ Yes . ”
97050	97064	97065	97065	They	2450	“ Thank you . That explains a lot . I should have realized — ”
97099	97109	97096	97096	he	379	“ Do n't any of these people actually fish ? ”
97110	97119	97120	97120	Giuliani	294	“ No , I do n't think so , ”
97124	97139	97120	97120	Giuliani	294	“ They certainly know their way around boats , but they do n't fish . ”
97148	97159	97143	97143	Felipe	379	“ You know all these guys , do n't you ? ”
97160	97168	97169	97169	Giuliani	294	“ Yes . Second cousins , mostly . ”
97177	97194	97196	97196	Felipe	379	“ I do n't believe it . Mafia ! They 're Mafia , are n't they , ”
97201	97234	97235	97235	Giuliani	294	“ Oh , goodness . I would n't say that . One never says that . Of course , I do n't know for certain what their major source of income is , ”
97246	97255	97238	97238	his	294	“ but I could take an educated guess . ”
97265	97293	97294	97294	he	294	“ And in any case , the Mafia is Sicilian . In Naples , it 's the Camorra . Amounts to the same thing , I suppose , ”
97297	97392	97294	97294	he	294	“ Funny , is n't it . My grandfather and Emilio Sandoz 's grandfather were in the same line of work . Sandoz reminds me a little of my grandfather , now that I think of it . He was also a charming 208 MARY DORIA RUSSELL man in his own element but very stiff and wary with people he did n't trust or was uncomfortable with . And I felt privileged to be a member of his inner circle . I 'd have walked across hot coals for my grandfather . Coming about . ”
97428	97460	97413	97413	He	294	“ My father was relatively clean but the family money was as dirty as it comes . I found out when I was about seventeen . Very idealistic age , seventeen . ”
97468	97502	97503	97503	He	754	“ I never cease to marvel at the variety of motives men have for the priesthood . I suppose originally , for me , the vow of poverty was a way of compensating . ”
97521	97589	97503	97503	He	754	“ The first cutter I ever sailed was a gift from my grandfather , and dirty money bought it . Probably bought this boat as well , come to think of it . And it 's buying Emilio Sandoz the privacy and protection he needs , even as we speak . That 's why we 're in Naples , Reyes . Because my family owns this town . ”
97590	97601	97602	97602	Emilio	291	“ WHERE DID you learn to make gloves like this ? ”
97751	97765	97766	97766	he	291	“ I thought you were supposed to help me prepare for this shit , "
97777	97809	97766	97766	he	291	“ You let me walk in there cold , you sonofabitch . You could have warned me , John . You could have given me some idea of what they said . ”
97816	97833	97834	97834	He	298	“ I tried ! I did , dammit ! And anyway , you knew what happened — ”
97987	97999	98000	98000	John	298	“ I used to make gloves and shoes for a living , ”
98008	98018	98004	98004	Emilio	291	“ Everything was mass - produced when I left . ”
98019	98050	98051	98051	John	298	“ Yeah , well , it mostly still is but for a while , there were a bunch of us who were going to bring dignity back to human labor , ”
98060	98112	98051	98051	John	298	“ Everyone was going to have a trade , and we 'd all buy only handmade things , to make a market for it all . We were n't exactly Luddites or hippies , but it was that kind of thing . Make a shoe , save the world , right ? ”
98126	98152	98113	98113	Sandoz	291	“ That 's a movement that 's going to pass me by . Unless someone wants to make a market for putting pebbles into cups . ”
98153	98169	98170	98170	John	298	“ Well , it 's long gone anyhow . You 're doing better with those , ”
98207	98213	98214	98214	Emilio	291	“ I hate these things , ”
98218	98224	98214	98214	Emilio	291	“ You do ? Why ? ”
98225	98252	98253	98253	Emilio	291	“ At last . A simple question with an easy answer . I hate the braces because they hurt . And I am tired of pain . ”
98272	98306	98258	98258	bees	546	“ My hands hurt and my head is pounding and the braces bruise my arms . I feel like hell all the time . I 'm sick to death of it , John . ”
98321	98334	98335	98335	He	291	" Look . Let me take them off for you , okay ? ”
98349	98360	98361	98361	Emilio	291	“ You 've done enough for today . Come on . ”
98530	98539	98525	98525	he	298	“ Can I ask you something , Emilio ? ”
98540	98553	98483	98483	Candotti	298	" John , please . I already answered a thousand questions today . ”
98554	98582	98583	98583	Sandoz	291	" It 's just — why did they do this to you ? Was it torture ? I mean , it looks like such a neat job . ”
98590	98607	98609	98609	his	291	“ I am not entirely sure I understand it myself . The procedure was called hasta'akala . ”
98638	98700	98630	98630	he	291	“ It was n't supposed to be torture . I was told that the Jana'ata sometimes do this to their own friends . Supaari was surprised by how bad it was for us . I do n't think Jana'ata hands are innervated as extensively as ours . They do n't do much fine motor work . The Runa do all that . ”
98713	98787	98701	98701	John	298	“ It might have been an exercise in aesthetics . Maybe long fingers are more beautiful . Or a way of controlling us . We did n't have to work but then again , we could n't have . There were servants to take care of us . After . Marc Robichaux and I were the only ones left by then . It was supposed to be an honorable estate , I think . ”
98800	98837	98788	98788	His	298	“ I 'm not sure to whom the honor accrued . Supaari , I suppose . It was a way of showing that he could afford to have useless dependents in his household , I think . ”

98849	98890	98891	98891	He	298	“ Perhaps . Yes , maybe it was something like that . It killed Marc . He never stopped bleeding . He- I tried to explain to them about putting pressure on the wounds . But he never stopped bleeding . ”
98907	98916	98891	98891	He	298	“ You were hurt , too , Emilio . ”

99091	99119	99084	99084	John	298	" you told us that Marc began eating the native foods at the beginning , while you and Anne Edwards were still acting as controls , right ? ”
99121	99131	99132	99132	He	291	“ Shit , John . Give me a break . ”
99137	99148	99132	99132	He	291	“ I 'm going down to the beach , okay ? ”
99149	99174	99175	99175	Sandoz	291	“ No . Wait ! I 'm sorry , but this might be important . Was there anything you ate that Marc did n't ? ”
99184	99237	99175	99175	Sandoz	291	“ What if Marc Robichaux was developing scurvy ? Maybe that 's why he died . Maybe because he 'd been eating their food longer than you , or maybe you were getting vitamin C from some food he did n't eat . Maybe that 's why he did n't stop bleeding . ”
99238	99243	99244	99244	Sandoz	291	“ It 's possible , ”
99299	99306	99294	99294	he	298	“ What ? What 's wrong ? "
99347	99363	99365	99365	Sandoz	291	“ Talk to me , Emilio . Are you in pain ? What 's wrong ? ”
99385	99437	99438	99438	Emilio	291	“ The word hasta'akala is a K’San compound probably based on the stem staʼaka . The suffix ala indicates a similarity or a parallel . Or an approximation . The prefix ha makes the stem take on an active aspect , like a verb . Sta’aka was a kind of ivy , ”
99453	99486	99487	99487	He	291	“ It was very pretty . It would climb on larger , stronger plants , like our ivies , but it had branches with a weeping growth habit , like a willow . ”
99513	99561	99564	99564	him	291	“ It was symbolic of something . I knew that , from context . Supaari tried to ex- 212 MARY DORIA RUSSELL plain , I think , but it was too abstract . I trusted him , so I gave my consent . Oh , my God . ”
99580	99604	99609	99609	he	291	“ I gave consent for Marc , as well . And he died . I blamed Supaari , but it was my fault . ”
99656	99743	99652	99652	Sandoz	291	“ You can see it , ca n't you . Hasta'akala : to be made like sta'aka . To be made visibly and physically dependent on someone stronger . He offered us hasta'akala . He took me to the garden and showed me the ivy and I did n't make the connection . I thought he was offering Marc and me his protection and hospitality . I thought I could trust him . He asked my consent and I gave it . And I thanked him . ”
99744	99758	99789	99789	Sandoz	291	“ It was a misunderstanding . Emilio , you could n't have known — "
99759	99782	99783	99783	John	298	" I could have ! I knew everything then that I have just told you now . I just did n't think ! ”
99794	99807	99789	99789	Sandoz	291	“ And Marc died . Christ , John . Oh , Jesus . ”
99808	99840	99841	99841	John	298	" Emilio , it was n't your fault . Even if you 'd understood about the ivy , you could n't have known that they 'd do this to your hands , ”
99866	99892	99862	99862	Sandoz	291	“ Robichaux was probably already sick . You did n't cut up his hands , Emilio . You did n't make him bleed to death . ”
99893	99898	99841	99841	John	298	“ I am responsible . ”
99899	99911	99912	99912	John	298	“ There is a difference between being responsible and being culpable , ”

100515	100560	100561	100561	He	294	“ The choice of word disturbs you ? It did me , at first . But I have reconsidered . What is a whore but someone whose body is ruined for the pleasure of others ? I am God 's whore , and ruined . ”
100572	100583	100591	100591	Giuliani	294	“ What was it you bastards used to call me ? ”
100584	100590	100591	100591	Giuliani	294	“ God 's best beloved , ”
100607	100641	100591	100591	Giuliani	294	“ Yes . I wondered if you 'd remember . God 's favorite ! Is n't that what they used to call a king 's mistress ? Or his catamite . His favorite ? ”

100865	100871	100872	100872	Sandoz	291	" Are you not concerned , ”
100879	100895	100872	100872	Sandoz	291	" that , alone and unsupported , you will make a decision that gives scandal ? ”

100940	100964	100937	100937	he	294	“ Does one dream in coma ? I have often wondered if a well - placed bullet to the brain would be helpful . ”

100990	101019	100987	100987	Sandoz	291	“ you might provide enough liquor for me to drink myself insensible every night . I have headaches all the time anyway . A hangover would hardly register . ”

107562	107566	107567	107567	Askama	502	“ Si zhao ! ”
107578	107582	107583	107583	Emilio	291	“ Si zhao , ”
107586	107590	107591	107591	He	291	“ A flower . ”
107628	107632	107633	107633	Askama	502	“ Sa zhay ! ”
107647	107655	107656	107656	he	291	“ Sa zhay , indeed , chiquitita , ”

108201	108204	108205	108205	he	291	“ God ! ”
108238	108241	108242	108242	he	291	“ God , ”
108257	108264	108242	108242	he	291	“ I was born for this ! ”
108282	108302	108303	108304	Johannes Voelker	301	“ SO THIS CHILD was assigned to learn your language and to teach you hers , is that correct ? ”
108307	108407	108303	108304	Johannes Voelker	301	“ Essentially . The Runa are a trading people who require many languages to do business . As among us , their children learn languages quickly and easily , so they take advantage of that , yes ? Whenever a new trading partnership is formed , a child is raised jointly by its family and the foreign delegation , which also includes a child . It takes only a couple of years to establish fairly sophisticated communication . The language is then passed along within Runa lineages . There are stable relationships developed over generations with established trading partners . ”
108479	108492	108493	108494	Johannes Voelker	301	“ And they imagined you to be a child with this function ? ”
108500	108503	108497	108498	THE SPARROW	377	“ Yes . ”
108504	108517	108518	108519	Felipe Reyes	379	“ Presumably because you were somewhat smaller than others in the party , ”
108522	108569	108518	108519	Felipe Reyes	379	“ Yes . And because I carried on all the earliest attempts at communication , as such an interpreter would have . Actually , for a long time , only Mr. Quinn was accepted as an adult . He was about average height for a Runao . ”
108570	108590	108591	108591	Giuliani	294	“ And they were not frightened at the beginning ? Surely they 'd never seen anything like you before , ”
108594	108600	108591	108591	Giuliani	294	“ I find that remarkable . ”
108601	108647	108680	108680	Giuliani	294	“ The Runa are very tolerant of novelty . And we were obviously not a threat to them physically . They assumed , evidently , that whatever we were , we had come to trade . They fit us into their worldview on that basis . ”
108648	108665	108666	108666	Voelker	301	“ How old was the child Askama at the time of contact , would you estimate ? ”
108698	108752	108753	108753	Voelker	301	“ Dr. Edwards thought at first that Askama was the equivalent of a human child at seven or eight years of age . Later on we decided that she was only about five . It is difficult to compare the species but it was our impression that Runa maturation rates are relatively accelerated . ”
108764	108780	108761	108761	Giuliani	294	“ I was under the impression that intelligence was inversely correlated with rate of maturation . ”
108781	108831	108761	108761	Giuliani	294	“ Yes . Father Robichaux and Dr. Edwards discussed that . I think they decided that it was not a tight correlation , either between or within species . I may be remembering that wrong . In any case , the generalization may not hold in other biological systems . ”
108832	108845	108846	108846	Felipe	379	“ What was your impression of the Runa 's intelligence in general ? ”
108849	108866	108846	108846	Felipe	379	“ Did you find the Runa to be our equals or of greater or lesser capacity ? ”
108879	108884	108885	108885	Sandoz	291	“ They are different , ”
108900	108907	108885	108885	Sandoz	291	" It 's hard to say . ”
108922	108953	108908	108908	He	291	“ No , I 'm sorry . I ca n't answer that question with any confidence . There is a wide range of variation in intelligence . As among us . ”
108954	108958	108959	108960	Johannes Voelker	301	“ Dr. Sandoz , ”
108963	108972	108959	108960	Johannes Voelker	301	“ what precisely was your relationship with Askama ? ”
108977	108980	108981	108981	Sandoz	291	“ Exasperating , ”
109024	109036	109021	109021	Voelker	301	“ I do n't suppose you could expand upon that somewhat ? ”
109037	109081	109021	109021	Voelker	301	“ She was my teacher and my pupil and a reluctant collaborator in my research . She was spunky and bright . Insistent , relentless and a huge pain in the neck . She drove me crazy . I loved her without reservation . ”
109082	109090	109091	109091	Voelker	301	“ And did this child love you ? ”
109122	109137	109119	109119	his	298	“ This is another difficult question , like ' How intelligent are the Runa ? ”
109138	109143	109119	109119	his	298	” Sandoz said neutrally . “
109280	109281	109276	109276	she	502	" “
109296	109300	109292	109292	you	0	" Voelker asked . “
109306	109307	109302	109302	you	0	” “
109332	109336	109326	109326	I	0	” Sandoz admitted . “
109350	109374	109338	109338	you	0	” There was a murmur . They all recognized the words but no one had ever been called upon to define the distinction . “
109392	109396	109338	109338	you	0	” Sandoz said , “
109462	109490	109493	109494	SPARROW 233	377	” He shifted in his chair and moved his hands again , never able to find a comfortable position for his arms when the braces were on . “
109675	109676	109874	109874	You	2719	” “
109679	109811	109874	109874	You	2719	” Giuliani commented , and not simply in reference to the linguistic concept . On his own ground at last , Sandoz was an unexpectedly fluent , even expansive speaker . And he had neatly turned the conversation away from Askama , as Voelker had said he would . Interesting that Voelker , of all of them , seemed to have a knack for predicting Emilio 's reactions . There was a pause as Sandoz carefully and slowly closed his braced hands around his coffee cup and brought it to his lips . He set the cup down a little abruptly , almost losing control of the fingers , the ceramic clink loud in the quiet office . These small precise movements were still difficult for him . No one stared . “
109840	109862	109903	109903	they	2721	” he continued , resting his arms on the table , careful not to scratch its polished surface with the wires . “
109986	110035	109950	109951	the Runa	5279	” His voice was starting to shake . He stopped talking for a moment and glanced at Ed Behr , who nodded and moved to a corner of the office where only the Father General could see him draw a finger across his throat . 234 MARY DORIA RUSSELL “
110051	110062	110115	110115	her	502	” Emilio continued , returning his arms to his lap . “
110083	110084	110086	110086	Askama	502	” “
110100	110106	110086	110086	Askama	502	” Felipe Reyes speculated dryly . "
110185	110428	110429	110429	I	0	” He wanted to go . His hands felt scalded , and it was getting harder to push the morning 's news out of his mind . It had helped to have something impersonal to talk about , to give a lecture , but they 'd been at this now for three hours , and he was finding it difficult to concentrate ... The trouble with illusions , he thought , is that you are n't aware you have any until they are taken from you . There had been a new doctor , several hours of tests . The hands , he was told , could be improved cosmetically but not functionally ; the nerves had been severed too long ago to be repaired , the destruction of muscle was too extensive and complete . The burning sensation , which he was experiencing now and which came and went unpredictably , was probably similar to that endured by amputees , a sort of phantom - limb phenomenon . He could straighten the digits almost normally and he had some useful hook grip in two fingers of each hand . That was it . That was how it was going to beHe realized then that Johannes Voelker had spoken and a denser silence had fallen on the room . How long have I been sitting like this ? he wondered . Emilio reached for the coffee cup again , stalling for time . "
110433	110445	110429	110429	I	0	” he apologized , looking at Voelker after a few moments . “
110451	110452	110447	110447	you	0	” “
110483	110591	110473	110473	I	0	” The cup shattered in Emilio 's hand . There was a small fuss as Edward Behr brought a cloth to soak up the spilled coffee and John Candotti collected the broken china . Voelker simply sat and stared at Sandoz , who might have been carved from rock . They are so different , Vincenzo Giuliani thought , looking at the two THE SPARROW 235 men seated across the table from one another : the one , obsidian and silver ; the other , butter and sand . He wondered if Emilio had any idea how much Voelker envied him . He wondered if Voelker knew . “
110596	110613	110473	110473	I	0	” Felipe Reyes was saying , explaining Emilio 's lapse to them , covering the embarrassment . “
110638	110639	110646	110646	Felipe	379	” “
110648	110655	110646	110646	Felipe	379	” Sandoz said with soft venom , “
110664	110665	110666	110666	Emilio	291	” “
110671	110682	110668	110668	I	0	" There was a brief ugly exchange in gutter Spanish . “
110694	110702	110703	110703	Emilio	291	” the Father General broke in lightly . “
110719	110770	110771	110771	You	291	” Sandoz remained in his seat and waited impassively as Voelker , Candotti and a white - faced Felipe Reyes left . Edward Behr hesitated by the door and gave the Father General a small warning look , which went unacknowledged . When they were alone , Giuliani spoke again . “
110783	110784	110771	110771	You	291	” “
110789	110801	110787	110787	Sir	4127	” The black eyes turned to him , cold as stone . “
110810	110839	110803	110803	you	291	” A pointless question . Giuliani knew before it was out of his mouth that Sandoz would never admit it , not after what Voelker had just implied . “
110847	110855	110856	110856	I	0	” Emilio assured him with undisguised insolence . “
110863	110868	110873	110873	You	291	” Giuliani said pleasantly . “
110886	110887	110880	110880	you	291	” “
110897	110907	110888	110888	He	379	” Sandoz snapped , the anger visibly flooding back . “
110917	110918	110915	110915	Emilio	291	” “
110930	110931	110933	110933	you	291	” “
110949	110953	110954	110954	I	0	" Sandoz blinked . “
111016	111020	110995	110995	she	566	” Giuliani suggested , “
111029	111080	110995	110995	she	566	” It was subtle , but you could tell sometimes when you hit home . The 236 MARY DORIA RUSSELL breathing changed . The effort at control became slightly more visible . Suddenly , Giuliani found he had simply run out of patience with Sandoz 's damnable machismo and demanded , “
111090	111091	110995	110995	she	566	” “
111100	111112	111093	111093	I	0	” The mockery was plain ; its target was less clear . “
111124	111125	111126	111126	My	0	” “
111130	111136	111126	111126	My	0	” There was a pause . “
111144	111344	111126	111126	My	0	” Giuliani saw the quick shallow movement of the chest and thought , My God , what it costs this man to admit he 's suffering ! Abruptly , the Father General stood and walked away from the table , to give himself time to think . Emilio 's sweat and vomit were familiar now , his body 's fragility mercilessly exposed . Giuliani had nursed him through night terrors and had watched , appalled , as Sandoz pulled himself back together , holding the pieces in place with who knew what emotional baling wire . One could not forget all that , even when Sandoz was at his most aggravating , when one felt as though the man perceived the simplest effort to help him as insult and abuse . For the first time it occurred to him to wonder what it was like to be so frail in what should have been the prime of life . Vince Giuliani had never known illness more debilitating than a cold , injury more damaging than a broken finger . Perhaps , he thought , if I were Sandoz , I too would hide my pain and snarl at solicitude ... “
111347	111358	111359	111359	Emilio	291	” he said , relenting , returning to the table . “
111379	111387	111374	111374	I	0	” Sandoz glared at him , furious . “
111394	111398	111399	111399	I	0	” Giuliani cried . “
111413	111434	111399	111399	I	0	” A laugh . A genuine laugh . And buoyed by that small triumph , Giuliani tried a direct appeal . “
111473	111485	111486	111486	I	0	” When Sandoz spoke again , the words were barely audible . “
111494	111498	111486	111486	I	0	” Giuliani sighed . “
111514	111588	111508	111508	Candotti	298	” The idiot ! It was not the sort of revelation that came under the seal of confession . Although it might have felt like that to Sandoz , he realized . Giuliani got up and went to the private lavatory adjacent to his office . He came back with a glass of water and a couple of tablets , which THE SPARROW 237 he placed on the table in front of Sandoz . “
111604	111610	111589	111589	I	0	” Giuliani told Emilio quietly . “
111623	111646	111589	111589	I	0	" He watched as Emilio struggled to pick up the pills , one by one , and wash them down with water . “
111704	111782	111783	111783	Emilio	291	” He picked up the glass and carried it back to the lavatory , where he remained for a few minutes . Sandoz was still sitting at the table , withdrawn and pale , when Giuliani returned . Taking a chance , the Father General went to his desk and brought back a notebook , tapping out a code that opened a file only he and two other men , now dead , had been privy to . “
111825	111831	111817	111817	I	0	” Vincenzo Giuliani told him . “
111891	111906	111907	111907	Emilio	291	” Sandoz did not react , and Giuliani wondered if the man was listening . “
111909	111920	111925	111925	his	534	” Sandoz looked at him , so Giuliani pressed ahead . “
111980	111981	111950	111950	He	534	” “
111985	111986	111988	111988	me	0	” "
111990	112036	111988	111988	me	0	” Giuliani looked up from the tablet he was reading , blinking , unaccustomed to being addressed in this manner , even in private , even by a man whose nights were now a part of his own , whose dreams interrupted his own sleep . “
112044	112049	111988	111988	me	0	" Sandoz was trembling . “
112059	112078	111988	111988	me	0	” There was a long silence , as Giuliani looked into the terrible eyes and absorbed the implications . “
112085	112089	112091	112091	me	0	” he said . “
112093	112112	112091	112091	me	0	” Sandoz sat looking at him a while longer , his head turned away slightly , still shaking . “
112131	112152	112091	112091	me	0	” 238 MARY DORIA RUSSELL It was , in its own way , a sort of apology , Giuliani realized . “
112163	112170	112155	112155	you	291	” the Father General suggested gently . “
112182	112215	112180	112180	myself	0	” Emilio cried . He stood abruptly and walked a few steps away and then turned back . It was always startling when Sandoz broke down . His face would hardly move . “
112242	112272	112240	112240	Vince	295	” He lifted his hands and let them fall , defeated . Vincenzo Giuliani , who had heard many confessions in his years , remained silent , and waited . “
112287	112334	112283	112283	I	0	” Emilio said in a voice frayed by incomprehension . The crying stopped as suddenly as it had begun . He stood for a long while , staring at nothing Giuliani could see , and then went to the window to look out at the rain . “
112344	112365	112366	112366	I	0	” And then , incredibly , he started to laugh . It could be as shocking as the sudden tears . “
112369	112375	112366	112366	I	0	” the Father General said , “
112398	112518	112386	112386	I	0	” Emilio did not answer right away . So much , he was thinking , for keeping silent about what ca n't be changed . So much for Latino pride . He felt sometimes like the seedhead of a dandelion , flying apart , blown to pieces in a puff of air . The humiliation was almost beyond bearing . He thought , and hoped sometimes , that it would kill him , that his heart would actually stop . Maybe this is part of the joke , he thought bleakly . He turned away from the windows to gaze across the room at the elderly man watching him quietly from the far end of the beautiful old table . “
112524	112549	112520	112520	I	0	” Emilio Sandoz said , coming as close as he could to the center of his soul and to an admission that shamed him , “
112560	113108	112554	112554	I	0	” IN A WAY , Vincenzo Giuliani considered it a great and terrible privilege to try to understand Emilio , now , at this stage of their bizarrely disjointed lives . Dealing with Sandoz was as fascinating as sailing in dirty weather . One had to make constant adjustments to endless changes in force and direction and there was always the danger of foundering and going under . It was the challenge of a lifetime . In the beginning , he had dismissed Yarbrough 's assessment of Emilio 's spiritual state . Discounted it as inaccurate or overwrought . He distrusted mysticism , despite the fact that his order was founded upon it . 11 THE SPARROW 239 And yet , he was willing to take as a working hypothesis the notion that Emilio Sandoz saw himself as a genuinely religious man , a soul looking for God , as Ed Behr had put it . And Sandoz must have felt , at some point , he had found God and betrayed Him . The worst of it , Sandoz said , was that he had loved God . Given that , Giuliani could see the tragedy : to fall so far from such a state of grace , to be on fire with God and let it go to ashes . To have received such a blessing and to repay it with a descent into whoredom and murder . Surely , Giuliani thought , there must have been some other way ! Why had Sandoz turned to prostitution ? Even without his hands , there must have been some other way . Beg , steal food , anything . Pieces of the puzzle were clear to him . Emilio felt himself to be unfairly condemned by men who had never been tested in such inhuman conditions of isolation and loneliness . Giuliani recognized that even to fail such a test bestowed a certain moral authority upon the man . And for that reason , he found it easy to beg Emilio 's forgiveness and give him some measure of respect . The tactic seemed to work . There were moments of genuine contact now and then , times when Sandoz was willing to risk some small disclosure in hope of being understood or of understanding something himself . But Giuliani knew that he was being kept at more than arm 's length , as though there were something that Sandoz himself could n't look at , let alone display . Something that could be dreamt of but not spoken , even in the dark of night . Something that would have to be brought into the light . It was necessary to consider the possibility that Ed Behr was wrong and Johannes Voelker was right . Perhaps , in isolation , Sandoz had turned to prostitution because he enjoyed it . He had loved God but found rough sex ... gratifying . Such a truth , at the core of his identity , held up for public scrutiny , might haunt his dreams and sicken him . Sometimes , as John Candotti was fond of saying , the simplest solution is the best . No less an observer of the human condition than Jesus once said , “
113129	113331	112554	112554	I	0	” Patience , Giuliani thought . An old sailor 's virtue . First one tack and then another . His staff in Rome , carefully nurtured and trained these past ten years , was competent . Time , and past time , for him to delegate more of the decisions , to let younger men strengthen as he kept a light hand on the tiller . Time for this particular old priest , for Vince Giuliani , to bring to 240 MARY DORIA RUSSELL the experience and knowledge of a lifetime to bear on one human problem , to call upon any wisdom he had garnered in his years to help one human soul , one man who called himself , with bitterness , God 's whore . Patience . It will take as long as it takes . Vincenzo Giuliani rose at last and moved toward the windows , where Sandoz had remained all this time , gray as the weather , staring out at the rain . Giuliani stepped in front of him and stood in plain sight , waiting until Sandoz noticed him , for he had learned never to startle the man by coming up behind him . “
113337	113343	113335	113335	Emilio	291	” Vince Giuliani said softly . “

This was both characteristic of him and unusual . Characteristic , in that he had recognized a potential Runa fad before anyone else and took steps to capture the market just before the trend took off in Gayjur . Unusual , in that he was not in command of the facts underlying the market before he moved . It was unlike him to risk so much without investigating first . The gamble paid off handsomely but even as the profits were totaled , it left him feeling uneasy , as though he had just missed being killed in a ha'aran duel undertaken while drunk . Moving through the warehouse with Awijan , his Runa secretary , who took down his orders and noted his inquiries , Supaari had spotted one of the Kashan villagers , a woman named Chaypas , standing at a doorway , waiting for permission to speak to him . She was wearing a cascade of ribbons worked into the circlet worn around her head : a waterfall of color , arrayed gracefully down her back . Lovely , Supaari thought , and it would quintuple the number of double - length ribbons desired by anyone who took the fashion up . He turned to Awijan . “
113620	113630	113631	113631	Someone	4267	” Supaari hesitated . How long would it last ? “
113644	113661	113631	113631	Someone	4267	” Supaari VaGayjur knew better than to second - guess Awijan on a decision like that . “
113700	113795	113796	113797	Challalla khaeri	559	” One of the many advantages of working with Runa , Supaari had found over the years , was that Jana'ata could n't see well in redlight but Runa could . It imposed a secrecy that his competitors , sleeping away the red and black hours , did n't even suspect . He watched as Awijan entered the courtyard , gathering the runners . Having set the transaction in motion , Supaari himself moved smoothly toward the VaKashani woman Chaypas and greeted her in her own language , holding out both hands to her . “
113801	114243	114244	114244	Sipaj	576	" He leaned forward and breathed in her scent , mingled with that of the fragrant ribbons . An unusual villager , willing to travel alone and to deal directly with Supaari VaGayjur in his own compound , Chaypas VaKashan returned the greeting without fear . Apart from their attire , they were alike enough to be sisters or near cousins , seen with a casual eye , from a distance . Supaari was more heavily muscled , slightly larger overall , facts enhanced by the padded gown , quilted and stiffened with embroidery ; the pattens , which gave him a hand 's width of extra height ; the headpiece , which provided another measure of stature and identified him as a merchant and , by implication , a third - born child . His clothing today emphasized the differences in their lives , but , when he wished , Supaari could pass for Runa , wearing the trailing oversleeves and boots of an urban Runao . It was not illegal . It simply was n't done . Most Jana'ata , even most thirds , would rather have died than be taken for Runa . Most Jana'ata , even most thirds , were not nearly so wealthy as Supaari VaGayjur . It was his stigma and his comfort , that wealth . Supaari coaxed Chaypas indoors , away from the foot traffic , so that her ribbons would not be noticed by others of her kind before he had a chance to jump the market . Chatting , he walked ahead of her through the warehouse , showing her the way to his office as though she were not already familiar with it , allowing her to rearrange the cushions to her comfort as he prepared a yasapa tea he knew she liked . He served her THE SPARROW 243 himself , even pouring it , to show respect : Supaari VaGayjur went his own profitable way . Taking a place across from Chaypas , he reclined comfortably on the cushions , careful to mimic her own posture as closely as possible . They talked amiably about the outlook for the sinonja harvest , the health of her husband , Manuzhai , and the prospects for resolution of a potential dispute between Kashan and Lanjeri over a new k’jip field . Supaari offered to mediate if the elders could n't agree . He had no wish to impose himself on them and he did not relish the long tedious trip out to Kashan , but it would be worth the trouble to keep his scent fresh in everyone 's nostrils . “
114248	114262	114244	114244	Sipaj	576	” Chaypas said , coming to the point of her visit at last . “
114270	114523	114263	114263	Someone	4267	” She reached into a woven pouch and pulled out a small packet made of intricately folded leaves . She held it out to him but he lowered his ears regretfully : his hands were incapable of unwrapping the object carefully . Her own ears flattened abruptly in embarrassment , but Supaari took her gesture as a compliment . The VaKashani villagers sometimes forgot he was Jana'ata . In its own way , in context , it was high praise , Supaari thought , although his eldest brother would have killed her for it and his middle brother would have had her jailed . He watched as Chaypas picked the strands of wrapping apart gracefully , with a Runao 's lovely long - fingered dexterity . She held out to him seven of what he took at first to be beetles or unusually small kintai . Then , leaning forward , Supaari inhaled . It was the most extraordinary thing he 'd ever encountered . He knew he was getting esters and aldehydes , and the smell of burnt sugars certainly , but the scent was staggeringly complex . All this from a few small brown objects , oval , incised with a longitudinal line . Supaari covered his excitement with the ease of a man who has made a living of concealment . Even so , it came to him with a jolt that here , at last , was something that might interest Hlavin Kitheri , the Reshtar of Galatna . “
114530	114548	114524	114524	Someone	4267	” he told Chaypas , raising his tail with mild pleasure , not wanting to alarm her . “
114561	114562	114563	114563	Sipaj	576	” “
114576	114583	114574	114574	foreigners	2752	” She used a Ruanja word meaning "
114591	114631	114574	114574	foreigners	2752	” but her eyes were open very wide and her tail was twitching . There was some delicious joke here , Supaari realized , but he let her en- 244 MARY DORIA RUSSELL joy the amusement at his expense . “
114636	114641	114642	114642	Askama	502	” she told him . “
114644	114659	114660	114662	A good child	2755	” he cried , throwing his hands up in delight , elegant claws clicking . “
114668	114956	114958	114959	the foreigners	5282	” And ugly as white water in a narrow gorge , but no matter . If Chaypas 's household was interpreting for the Kashan corporation , Supaari would have an exclusive trading relationship with the new delegation , by Runa custom if not by Jana'ata law and , in cases like this , Runa custom was all that counted . He 'd based his life on that understanding and if it brought him no honor , it nonetheless provided much of what he savored : risk to stalk , intellectual challenge and a certain grudging deference among his own . They chatted a while longer . He established that these small kafay were only a sample of a much larger store of unusual goods brought by the foreigners , who were staying in Kashan in Chaypas 's own household . And Supaari heard with growing interest that they seemed to have no notion of profit , giving their goods away for the food and shelter that was theirs by right , as sojourners . Cunning , he wondered , or some nomadic remnant group , still bartering in the old , clean ways ? Supaari laid the little packet aside and , disciplined , did not allow himself to trail and capture the idea that he had scented in the distance : posterity and a way out of the living death he was born to . He rose instead and refilled Chaypas 's cup , asking after her plans . She told him she would be visiting trade partners in the Ezao district . She was in no hurry to return home . All the other VaKashani would be leaving the village soon to harvest pik root . “
114961	114997	114958	114959	the foreigners	5282	” he asked . He was already planning the trip in his mind , maybe in mid - Partan , after the rains . But Kitheri came first . It all hinged on Hlavin Kitheri . "
115015	115029	115013	115013	children	1322	” Chaypas told him . She seemed a little puzzled by this herself . “
115050	115090	115091	115091	Sipaj	576	” If Supaari was curious before , he was baffled now , but Chaypas was showing signs of nervousness , swaying from side to side , as she often did when she spent too much time in ghost houses . “
115095	115122	115091	115091	Sipaj	576	” he said , rising smoothly from his cushions , calculating that enough time had passed for Awijan to have concluded terms with the ribbon suppliers . “
115146	115291	115292	115292	Sipaj	576	” THE SPARROW 245 Her tail came up with pleasure and she even trembled a little , her eyes sliding away and closing . This bordered on flirtation and it passed his mind that she was remarkably attractive . He smothered the spark before it caught fire . Third - born , he still had his standards , which were considerably higher than those of his social betters . Urbane and sophisticated in many ways , Supaari VaGayjur was thoroughly bourgeois in others . He sent a runner for a chair and , stifling yawns , waited with Chaypas in the courtyard until it arrived shortly after second sundown . He could hardly see her as she climbed into the chair but the fragrance of her ribbons was very fine ; she had wonderful taste in perfumes , a natural elegance that Supaari admired . “
115296	115301	115292	115292	Sipaj	576	” he called quietly , “
115310	115603	115292	115292	Sipaj	576	” She returned his farewell , laughing breathily as the bearers lifted the chair supports , rocking the seat . It was a luxury few Runa ever experienced , to be carried through the narrow city streets like a lord . Supaari was genuinely pleased to provide her with an evening she would remember , borne through the crowds of urban Runa , safe to go about their personal business in the blushing light of evening , while the Jana'ata slept . The breeze off the bay would carry her new ribbons like cirrus clouds behind her , their fragrance rising like mist from a cataract . By tomorrow , merchants from all over the city of Gayjur would be looking for ribbon at any price , and Supaari VaGayjur would own every scrap of it . IT WAS SOFIA Mendes 's fate to enrich investors who were unknown to her . The heavy black hair , which had inspired Chaypas to invent a new fashion , was at this moment pushed carelessly back , the ribbons Askama had braided into it slipping into disarray . Irritable as Sofia Mendes was , she 'd have cut it all off without a thought , had scissors been handy . She 'd brewed a cup of coffee out of habit , but it was too hot today to drink it and it cooled at her elbow ; soon , such profligacy would be shocking . At the moment , however , beauty , adornment and wealth were further from her mind than usual , which was very far indeed . Her intellect was wholly occupied with the task of finding some sufficiently uncivil response to Emilio Sandoz 's suggestion that she was being stupid . “

115627	115631	115623	115623	You	2762	” she whispered . “

115741	115754	115739	115739	Sandoz	291	” Emilio took a deep breath and began again with unconcealed impatience . “
115792	115833	115739	115739	Sandoz	291	” He reached out toward the tablet that lay on the table between them and stabbed a finger down at a section of the display , careful not to jar Askama , who had just fallen asleep in his arms . “
115868	115878	115865	115865	You	2762	” He pointed to another section of the screen . “
115908	115919	115865	115865	You	2762	” Concrete and abstract , dammit , she thought stubbornly . “
115931	115933	115934	115934	I	0	” . “
115949	115955	115937	115937	you	2762	” He ignored her glare . “

116048	116073	116092	116092	she	502	” She had him . Face bright as ivory in the sun , she leaned forward and prepared to deliver the coup de grâce . “

116130	116168	116170	116170	Chaypas	571	” . He was being patronizing . She stared at him , open - mouthed , ready to detonate , when it suddenly came clear . Letting her head fall abruptly into her hands , she muttered , “
116207	116216	116217	116217	I	0	” She looked up . He was grinning . “
116225	116336	116221	116221	you	2762	” The dark , merry eyes were triumphant . Emilio Sandoz had taken no vow of false modesty . It was a nice piece of analysis and he was immensely pleased with himself , and it had not escaped his own notice that he 'd won Sofia 's bet with Alan Pace . They 'd made contact with the Runa only seven weeks ago , but he already had the basic grammar nailed . Damn , I 'm good , he thought to himself , and his grin widened as Sofia stared at him through narrowed eyes , trying to think of some case that would n't fit the model . “
116343	116353	116354	116354	I	0	” she said ungraciously , picking up her tablet , “
116368	116400	116354	116354	I	0	" They were a good team . Sandoz was a master of this discipline but she was a far better writer , fast and clear . Already three papers bearing the authorship “
116408	116544	116354	116354	I	0	” had been radioed back for submission to scholarly journals . Finished with her notes , Sofia looked up and smiled . She had met before , in yeshiva students whom her parents often invited to dinner when she was a girl , this mixture of incisive intelligence and dreaminess , the joyful combative intellectual style and the tendency to fall into an inner world , absorbed and remote . Barelegged and barefoot , Sandoz was tanned to the color of cinnamon , wearing the loose khaki shorts and oversized black T - shirt that had replaced the soutane , impossibly hot in this climate . Sofia herself was equally browned , similarly dark and slender , dressed as simply , and she could understand why Manuzhai had assumed at first that she and Emilio were "
116547	116620	116621	116621	I	0	” The notion had been funny and embarrassing , as Manuzhai 's pantomimed explanation of the word had been , but she could see how a Runao might come to that conclusion . Askama sighed , stretching out a little . Emilio came to life and looked at Sofia with round - eyed alarm . Askama was dear , but she chattered incessantly ; naps like this one were a welcome relief . “
116624	116640	116621	116621	I	0	” said Sofia very softly , when it was clear that Askama would not awaken , "
116652	116653	116642	116644	a blind Runao	2766	” "
116661	116727	116642	116644	a blind Runao	2766	” Emilio said , inclining his head with respect , and she was tartly pleased to have reestablished claim to an adequate intelligence . He thought a while , rocking the hammock chair gently , one fine - boned foot braced against a hampiy stem , fingers stroking the soft fur behind Askama 's ears . The sunrise smile reap- 248 MARY DORIA RUSSELL peared . “
116757	116758	116759	116759	Lejano	580	” “

116799	116832	116833	116833	THEY	2768	” He smiled down at the top of Askama 's head before returning his eyes to the small herd of piyanot grazing on the plain beyond the stems of the hampiy shelter . “
116843	116862	116841	116841	they	2768	” Anne said as she and D.W. strolled along the edge of the gorge , above the village . “
116867	116871	116872	116872	They	2768	” D.W. agreed . “
116876	116918	116872	116872	They	2768	” Everyone else was occupied or asleep , and they had found themselves restless together . Anne proposed a walk , and D.W. was happy to accompany her . Manuzhai had warned them all , repeatedly , against walking alone . A “

117070	117082	117060	117060	I	0	” Anne laughed appreciatively and leaned her head against his shoulder . “

Moving cautiously , he brought his hand out over a little tuft of dusty lavender foliage and remained in position for several seconds . Then his hand shot out , carefully covering and then lifting a small two - legged snakeneck , which had been virtually undetectable pushing its way slowly into something else 's burrow , hoping to find lunch . He stood and handed it to Anne . “
117373	117385	117360	117360	you	291	” she cried , holding it out for him to see . “

119282	119385	119278	119278	D.W.	377	“ For Emilio , the separation between natural and supernatural is basic . God is not everywhere . God is not immanent . God is out there somewhere , to be reached for and yearned after . And you 're gon na have to trust me on this , but celibacy is part of the deal for Emilio . It 's a way of concentrating , of focusing a life on one thing . And I happen to think it 's worked for him . I do n't know whether it 's he found God , or God come and got him ... "

122871	122919	122861	122861	they	2322	” Emilio was about to protest that Askama was very quick but there was , he thought , something to George 's observation . The Runa could be perceptive , but he did occasionally find some of them — not dense , really , but limited somehow . “
122929	122936	122937	122937	They	2322	” George was saying , disgusted . “
122959	122960	122954	122954	they	2322	” “
122966	122970	122954	122954	they	2322	” Sofia said . “
123022	123047	123212	123212	George	315	” She was allowed to sit in on what seemed to be village council discussions and picked up a lot of information that way . “
123082	123210	123212	123212	George	315	” Anne cleared her throat and made a small movement with her head in D.W. 's direction , grinning . Yarbrough grunted , refusing to be bullyragged . To his everlasting irritation , coffee was their choicest trade item . Worse yet , it was n't even coffee per se , but the aroma of coffee . Sofia would brew some of her awful damn Turkish mud and Manuzhai would hold the cup in her hands , breathe the fragrance in and then pass it around to other guests . When the coffee cooled off , they 'd hand it back to Sofia , who 'd drink the wretched stuff . The Jesuit party could pay for almost anything by sharing a cup of coffee with someone . “
123216	123264	123212	123212	George	315	” said Jimmy who , like George , was perilously close to being bored by the Runa . The two men were working mainly on downloaded astronomical and meteorological data these days , but the we are . 260 MARY DORIA RUSSELL city with the transmitters beckoned . “
123300	123395	123396	123396	Someone	4267	” D.W. grunted an assent . There had been no sung Masses since the first one witnessed by the Runa , who had become agitated and distressed . At first he thought it was the ritual aspects of the behavior that bothered them ; the Runa did n't seem to have any religious specialists or ceremonies themselves . But it turned out that if the Liturgy was merely said , the Runa were fine . And they liked the incense . So it was n't the rites ; it was evidently the singing itself . “
123410	123414	123396	123396	Someone	4267	” Marc said . “
123465	123466	123443	123443	they	2888	” “
123482	123486	123443	123443	they	2888	” Anne said . “

123548	123552	123531	123531	you	2886	” George said , “
123561	123562	123531	123531	you	2886	” “
123565	123829	123531	123531	you	2886	” Jimmy pointed out , waving an arm at the stone walls around them , and there was a round of applause from everyone but Anne . Emilio laughed but lost the thread of the discussion at that point , as he often did when too many people had strong opinions and expressed them well ; he 'd always hated seminars . Where 's Askama ? he wondered , missing her already . She was with him so continually that he felt as though he had taken over as her parent in some ways , and there were aspects of this strange cross - species pseudofatherhood that were deeply satisfying . But while the VaKashani generally addressed him by name , they also used a kinship term that seemed to make him Askama 's older sibling . And Manuzhai sometimes corrected him rather sharply for inadvertent infractions , as though he were also her child . At the same time , there was a commercial aspect to their relationship having to do with trade goods , and he was not at all clear about what was expected of him . His status among his human friends was sometimes equally confusing . The first time he 'd fallen apart during Mass had been frightening , 1 we THE SPARROW 261 but neither Marc nor D.W. seemed surprised or upset ; they were instead oddly careful with him , as though he were pregnant — that was the only parallel that came to mind . It was Sofia who put words to what he felt . “
123838	123914	123915	123915	Sandoz	291	” she told him flatly one afternoon , and he realized then that what he had believed to be entirely interior had been more apparent than he could have imagined . He wished he had time to think it all through but there was just too much going on , and even when things slowed up for a while , he tended to meditate on beer and baseball . A pebble landed on his chest . “
123917	123921	123979	123979	I	0	” said Sofia , “
123925	123932	123915	123915	Sandoz	291	” He rose onto his elbows . “

123987	124092	123979	123979	I	0	” Drawn back into the argument that ensued , Emilio found himself uneasy about going to the city . Things felt so right here . It might simply be an emotional attachment to Askama and her people , but the notion of starting another language so soon was daunting . He 'd taken on two and sometimes three languages simultaneously before , but there had always been someone who spoke Latin or English . Without Askama or someone like her , he 'd be badly handicapped when he tried the Singers ' language . He waited for a break in the conversation and said , “
124106	124113	124116	124116	you	0	” It was D.W. who asked , “
124122	124123	124116	124116	you	0	” “

124310	124331	124295	124295	We	2905	” Emilio said to Marc , shrugging . He was willing to go or stay . 10V 262 MARY DORIA RUSSELL "

124534	124543	124527	124527	you	315	” Emilio advised , speaking at the ceiling . “

124556	124581	124527	124527	you	315	” Marc grumbled . He held up a leaf and examined it critically . Feeling ungrateful , he searched for something nice to say . “

124606	124634	124635	124635	Emilio	291	" D.W. said sourly . Emilio smiled at that and was about to comment when he realized that D.W. 's eyes were closed , which was odd . “
124637	124645	124635	124635	Emilio	291	” Marc said , interrupting his thoughts , “

He knew if they started a garden , they 'd be stuck here for a while , but George Edwards had been a serious gardener back in Cleveland and the idea of trying to grow things here had a certain compensatory appeal . Jimmy would be restless , but that was his problem . “

The talk moved on and after a while , Jimmy began clearing dishes , his job now that astronomers had been replaced on the active - duty roster by linguists . Emilio waited until the room emptied a little , everyone moving off to their own after - dinner activities , and went to D.W. , hunched over and silent , his meal untouched . "
124985	125012	124983	124983	Padre	454	” he said , dropping down next to Yarbrough so he could look up at the creased and crooked face , hidden now behind bony fingers . "

125063	125163	124983	124983	Padre	454	” Anne moved between the two men and spoke quietly to D.W. , who answered her questions in monosyllables and remained immobile until he suddenly doubled up and groaned , gripping Emilio 's arm in spite of himself . 24 VILLAGE OF KASHAN AND CITY OF GAYJUR : THIRD - FIFTH NA'ALPA WITHIN AN HOUR , it became obvious that D. W. Yarbrough was very sick . Emilio , hoping that Manuzhai might be of some help , went looking for her and found her in one of the biggest rooms , surrounded by people deep in a discussion of "
125165	125210	124983	124983	Padre	454	” somethings . Everyone 's ears cocked toward him expectantly as he entered the room , so he tried to explain what seemed to be wrong with D.W. and asked if anyone recognized this illness , knew what caused it or what might help . “
125217	125222	125223	125223	His	2916	” Manuzhai told him . “
125232	125233	125223	125223	His	2916	" “
125243	125247	125248	125248	His	2916	” Emilio persisted . “
125258	125268	125248	125248	His	2916	” He made a gripping motion with his hands . “
125278	125494	125495	125495	Sipaj	576	” That set off an interminable discussion of what for all the world sounded like the arcane rules for keeping kosher , with everyone offering stories of how so - and - so got sick once from mixing long foods with round foods , which triggered skeptical commentary along the lines of whether or not that was true or just an excuse someone had used to get out of doing work , and then several people said they mixed round and long all the time and never got sick . Finally , he began to sway from side THE SPARROW 265 to side , to indicate to them that he was getting anxious . This was getting him nowhere . Manuzhai seemed to understand his need to return to the apartment , so she stood up and took her leave of the rest to escort him home , afraid he 'd fall from the narrow walkways connecting the apartments and terraces ; no matter what they told her , she remained convinced that the foreigners could n't see in the dim red light of Rakhat 's smallest sun . Askama came with them , clinging to her mother for a change , but she looked up at Emilio and asked with a child 's bluntness , “
125507	125558	125500	125500	Dee	593	” Emilio was speechless . It was his unvarying policy to tell the truth and in truth , after Alan Pace 's death , it seemed all too possible that Yarbrough would not live through the night , but he could n't find the words to speak the thought aloud . “
125561	125588	125500	125500	Dee	593	” Manuzhai answered for him , raising her tail and letting it drop in what he had come to believe was the equivalent of a shrug . “
125597	125605	125606	125606	Someone	4267	” Finding his voice , Emilio said , “
125620	125621	125606	125606	Someone	4267	” “
125642	125650	125638	125638	Dee	593	” Manuzhai said , with unassailable logic . “
125664	125918	125638	125638	Dee	593	” THERE WAS NO real privacy in Runa life . The apartments had , at most , alcoves or irregularities that could serve to separate some habitual divisions of use . No one seemed to own any apartment , other than by occupying it . Families sometimes left to visit other villages and rooms might be left empty for a little while , but if another family liked the apartment , they moved in ; when the travelers returned , they simply chose someplace else in the village to stay . Anne and George Edwards found the lack of a bedroom door embarrassing and they 'd appropriated the most recessed region of Manuzhai and Chaypas 's apartment , going so far as to set up a tent inside the dwelling . The rest had put up their camp beds in a different place every night or , if the apartment was filled with guests , simply dossed down on Runa cushions wherever there was space . D.W. 's bed was toward the back of the apartment ordinarily , but Anne had it moved to the entrance so he could get out fast . He 'd already 266 MARY DORIA RUSSELL emohad several bouts of intestinal distress and was now lying still , curled around a heated rock wrapped in cloth , eyes closed , face rigid . Sitting on the floor next to him , Anne put a hand on his head , pulling the damp hair off his forehead , and said , “
125927	125955	125638	125638	Dee	593	" He made no sign that he 'd heard , but she rose anyway and went to Emilio , who 'd just returned with Manuzhai and Askama . “
125962	125984	125957	125957	you	2922	” she asked , motioning him away from D.W. 's bed and out to the terrace , where they could talk . “
125989	125999	126000	126000	Thwarted	594	” But he told her what Manuzhai had said . “
126008	126063	126000	126000	Thwarted	594	” Anne said softly . It was a Runa notion she had come up against before and she thought it might be a fundamental paradigm of Runa social life . It bore thinking about later , when she had the wits to consider it as an anthropologist . Sofia joined Anne and Emilio outside . “
126066	126072	126073	126073	he	2922	” Anne said unemo tionally , "
126113	126114	126115	126115	Anne	332	” “
126128	126132	126115	126115	Anne	332	” said Emilio . “
126148	126149	126115	126115	Anne	332	" “
126152	126162	126115	126115	Anne	332	” Anne looked at him , her eyes serious . “
126165	126170	126115	126115	Anne	332	” Emilio agreed finally . “
126173	126174	126115	126115	Anne	332	” “
126183	126187	126179	126179	we	2924	” Sofia asked . “
126197	126272	126179	126179	we	2924	” said Anne . She stepped to the edge of the terrace and looked out across the gorge . It was a rare night on Rakhat , cloudless and starry , with a single , nearly full moon . The river splashed and foamed around the rocks below her , and she could hear the metallic squeal of a rusted iron gate blowing in the wind — the bizarre call of a redlight moranor . “
126308	126322	126333	126333	you	0	” Shit , Anne thought , and turned around to look at Sofia . “
126335	126337	126333	126333	you	0	” . “
126346	126376	126333	126333	you	0	” D.W. called out . He was in misery but he was neither comatose nor deaf , and he had heard at least some of what they 'd said . “
126406	126417	126400	126400	I	0	” Sofia went back inside and knelt by his bed . “
126459	126648	126454	126454	I	0	” It was public now , and everyone had an opinion . D.W. struggled to sit up and prove to Sofia he was n't that sick . Jimmy and George got involved in the argument , with Marc wading in as well . They should have thought of this before , but the time had gone by quickly and besides , they had hesitated to introduce the notion of manned flight to the Runa . They were making things up as they went along ; there were no guidelines except the negative example of their predecessors ' disastrous inter actions with technologically simple cultures on Earth . They had no wish to be taken for gods or to begin a cargo cult here . Even so , they had to go back for supplies eventually and they needed to reestablish the runway soon , so why not tonight ? Manuzhai , distressed by the dispute and swaying , took Askama by the hand and left the apartment to sit on the terrace . Emilio quietly apologized to her as she passed him , and then he went inside . “
126651	126660	126661	126661	D.W.	377	” he said softly , and silence fell . “
126702	126733	126752	126752	D.W.	377	” There was a burst of chagrined laughter . In the press of crisis , no one else had thought of that . Emilio ran his hands through his hair . "
126781	126825	126827	126827	I	0	” Nobody moved at first . Direct orders , issued from the mouth of Emilio Sandoz , Sofia Mendes was thinking , astonished . Evidently , the same observation had occurred to D. W. Yarbrough , who fell back laughing weakly and said , “
126835	126944	126827	126827	I	0	” Emilio said something rude in Spanish , and the small knot of anxious people arrayed around Yarbrough 's bed dispersed , leaving Emilio and D.W. alone finally , with Anne 's repeated instructions — to force liquids and call her if there was any vomiting in addition to the diarrhea - ringing in their ears . THAT NIGHT , THEY all were awakened over and over by the unavoidable disturbance caused when D.W. was forced to get up suddenly , and he became sicker by the hour . Then just before dawn , they woke again , this time to an unmistakable smell and D.W. 's groan of “
126954	127420	126949	126952	MARY DORIA RUSSELL God	290	” and lay awake , pretending to be unaware , listening to Emilio 's soft Spanish reassurances and Yarbrough 's humiliated weeping . Askama slept on but Manuzhai abruptly rose and left the apartment . Anne lay rigid next to George , listening carefully and weighing the choices as Emilio cleaned up the mess , efficient as a night nurse and as unflappable . D.W. was already mortified . A thirty - year taboo against touch had already been broken . A woman 's involvement would only make it worse , she decided . Anne heard Emilio insist that Yarbrough drink some more water , boiled and spiked with sugar and salt . The stuff tasted awful and D.W. gagged on it , but Emilio reminded him that dehydration could kill , and so with a practiced ease born of internship , Anne went back to sleep , trusting Emilio 's judgment , if not God 's will . Moments later , Manuzhai returned with a stack of simple woven mats used for infants ' beds . Emilio helped D.W. raise his hips and slipped one under him , before covering him again . Manuzhai , who had risen repeatedly to escort the two foreigners down the dark rocky pathway to the river and who had seen the tenderness of care one gave the other , now patted Yarbrough 's arm in a gesture of reassurance that was startlingly human and left to spend the balance of the night elsewhere . LONG AGO , Marc Robichaux had observed that a natural tendency to awaken early in the morning is a necessary though insufficient condition if a man is to survive formation and pass onward to ordination . He had known several men who might have become priests if waking at dawn had not done such violence to their normal sleep patterns . Among the Jesuit party on Rakhat , Marc Robichaux was ordinarily the alpha to Jimmy Quinn 's omega , so the apartment was silent as usual when Marc sat up and looked around . In the brief morning witlessness that afflicts even early risers , the night 's events were forgotten ; then Marc saw Sandoz in a sleeping bag next to the Father Superior 's bed and it all came back to him . His eyes went to Yarbrough , who , Marc saw with relief , was also sleeping . Marc pulled on khaki shorts and , barefoot , padded noiselessly out to the terrace , where Anne sat with Askama , who was trying to teach her the incredibly complicated version of cat 's cradle the Runa played . He looked at Anne inquiringly and she smiled and rolled her eyes heavenward , shaking her head at her own fears . “
127428	127436	127423	127423	they	2938	” Marc said quietly . THE SPARROW 269 “
127440	127718	127423	127423	they	2938	” she replied ironically . He smiled in return , and made his way down to the river . THE PRECARIOUSNESS OF their existence on this planet was once again in the forefront of their minds and D.W. 's probable recovery did not remove the sense of dancing on a high wire . By the time Emilio came out to the terrace , rubbing his face muzzily in the midmorning light , George and Sofia were trying to decide if they could rig some kind of rope ladder so somebody could jump off the Ultra - Light as she flew over the clearing at the slowest possible air speed , and then could clear the brush before she attempted to land . Anne was providing graphic descriptions of the sort of really interesting compound fractures that were likely to result from this plan while Marc argued that he might be able to tell from the air whether the growth that had undoubtedly begun to fill in the runway was woody or soft . Emilio , stupefied , stared at them for a few moments before turning away and going back to bed after an interlude at the river . He slept another couple of hours and when he came back out to the terrace , even D.W. was up , pale and rumpled but feeling a little better and making jokes about Runa 's Revenge . Jimmy was back from wherever he 'd been , and it appeared that at least one problem was about to resolve itself . That morning , Jimmy had learned that the villagers were about to leave for some kind of harvest . “
127722	127728	127729	127729	I	0	” Emilio said , yawning . “
127736	127737	127738	127738	They	2939	” “
127747	127752	127738	127738	They	2939	” Jimmy told them . “
127759	127763	127754	127754	they	2939	” George asked . “
127792	127796	127770	127772	One of them	1207	” Jimmy said . “
127823	127893	127811	127811	I	0	” In fact , it was his impression that the Runa would be just as happy to find out that the foreigners were n't coming . The troop moved at the pace of the slowest member , which had often been Anne or Sofia . No one complained , but it was obvious when they got where they were going that some of the flowers had passed their peak . “
127909	127986	127987	127987	Sipaj	576	” Emilio said , sitting down . The sky was hazy and it felt like it was going to be very hot . Sofia handed him a cup of coffee . Askama spotted him from two terraces away and scampered over , full of questions about D.W. , 270 MARY DORIA RUSSELL whom she was too shy to address directly , and why had Meelo slept so late and was everyone coming to dig pik root ? “
127991	127995	127989	127989	Askama	502	” Emilio said . “
128013	128060	128001	128001	Someone	4267	” The child looked crestfallen , ears at half - mast and tail drooping , but undaunted , she devoted the next half hour to cajolery , trying to talk them into coming . When it became plain that this would n't work , she declared herself "
128062	128087	128001	128001	Someone	4267	” and threatened to get sick like Dee because her heart was sad . Anne saw an opportunity to start working out what all this "
128090	128092	128001	128001	Someone	4267	” and "
128094	128106	128001	128001	Someone	4267	” stuff was about and took Askama off to another terrace . "
128112	128138	128001	128001	Someone	4267	” D.W. said when Askama and Anne were out of earshot . He was still pretty shaky , but it was important to reestablish command . “
128233	128234	128228	128228	Mendes	330	” “
128239	128243	128228	128228	Mendes	330	” Sofia asked . “
128250	128251	128228	128228	Mendes	330	” “
128255	128256	128228	128228	Mendes	330	” "
128270	128295	128228	128228	Mendes	330	” said Dalton Wesley Yarbrough , Father Superior of the Jesuit mission to the village of Kashan on Rakhat , amid cries of derision . “
128309	128468	128303	128303	I	0	” RUNA DISCUSSIONS TENDED to drag on for days but once a decision was made , the village mobilized with impressive efficiency . George and Sofia hardly waited until the last tail had disappeared before setting out in the opposite direction for the Ultra - Light cache . The little plane was reassembled within the hour , and Sofia took it up for a quick test run . Jimmy , linked to systems aboard the Stella Maris , established that the weather was okay on both sides of the mountain range . There was about seven hours of useful light left . With unsettling dispatch , Marc and Sofia climbed aboard , strapped in and made ready to leave , the others watching as Yarbrough leaned into the little cockpit , hands moving through the air , miming emergency maneuvers . When Sofia started the motor , D.W. stepped back and THE SPARROW 271 hollered with specious sternness , “
128493	128499	128303	128303	I	0	” Sofia laughed and shouted , “
128508	128530	128531	128531	I	0	” And then they were gone , the little plane rising quickly into the sky , wings tipping twice in farewell . “
128535	128549	128531	128531	I	0	” Anne said , when they could n't hear the motor any longer . “
128555	128606	128550	128550	You	0	” George said , but he put his arms around Anne from behind and kissed the top of her head . Jimmy said nothing but he wished now that he 'd had George take a look at the weather front coming in from the southwest before he okayed the flight . “
128614	128622	128607	128607	I	0	” Emilio said . And D.W. added , “
128630	128631	128623	128623	She	2956	” “
128636	128641	128623	128623	She	2956	” Anne said stubbornly . "
128649	129288	128642	128642	I	0	” SEVEN DAYS ' JOURNEY north of them , in his wharfside compound overlooking the high seawall that bordered his property , Supaari VaGayjur began that day with a similar sense of the precariousness of his existence . He was about to risk not life and limb but status and dignity . If he failed , it would put an end to dreams he hardly dared acknowledge . The stakes were very high , in that sense . He broke his fast with a handsome meal , gorging carefully : enough so that he would not need to consider meat again that day but not so much as to slow his thoughts . He spent the morning attending to business with the single - minded intensity of a first - born military man and the plodding thoroughness of a second - born bureaucrat . The only time his concentration broke was when he passed through the courtyard on his way to a storage building . He could not keep himself from glancing upward toward Galatna Palace , set apart like its inhabitant : splendid and useless . Around him , the city rang and vibrated and rumbled with the noise of manufacture and trade , the treble clang and shriek of metalworking momentarily dimmed by the bass of wooden wheels thundering over cobbles just outside his warehouse ; the clamor of craft and commerce merging with the noise of the docks , where six hundred vessels , laden with cargo from all over the southern coast of Rakhat 's largest continent , shouldered in toward the wharves of Gayjur , their largest market . 272 MARY DORIA RUSSELL Driven early from his natal compound , Supaari had been drawn to Gayjur as a two - moon tide is drawn to shore . He took passage downriver on a Runa freighter bringing huge baskets of carmine and violet datinsa to market . Pride was an expense he could not afford : he helped the Runa cook prepare the sailors ' meals to work off his fare . He expected humiliation and rejection ; it was all he 'd known . But in the four days he spent on that boat moving past the sea - carved filigree of the Masna'a Tafa'i coast , Supaari experienced more kindness and friendship than in all his childhood . The Runa were despised but so was he ; by the time he tasted the harsh metallic vapors and oily scents of Gayjur as they hove into Radina Bay , the cook had called him brother and Supaari felt less a youth condemned to exile than a man about to find a treasure , if only he has the wit to recognize it . Within a season , exhilarated by the challenges and risks of trade in the world 's largest commercial city , Supaari knew he had found his place and had formally taken his landname , VaGayjur . He began as a runner , working for another third who had come to Gayjur only five years earlier and who was already prospering beyond Supaari 's youthful ability to imagine wealth . He learned the universal laws of trade : buy low and sell high ; cut losses and let profits run ; smell the emotion of the market but do n't give way to it . And he discovered his own niche : a willingness , an eagerness to learn from the Runa , to speak their language and respect their ways and deal with them directly . His fortune was founded on a chance remark by a Runao from the midlands , visiting Gayjur to find a better market for her village 's weaving . There had been unusual rain in the high plateau of Sintaron , she said and commented , “
129296	130007	129289	129289	Rakari	596	” Later that day , Supaari checked with several shippers who worked the Pon riverway . They were making the trip in under five days . The river was high , they told him , with a good , fast current . Using everything he 'd saved and pledging two years of his labor against default , Supaari contracted to deliver rakari for three bhali per bale at the end of the season . He quit as a runner , traveled inland to the rakar fields , where the bumper crop was being harvested , and arranged to buy every bale at half a bhal . The pickers were pleased to get so much , the rakar processors were forced to pay the contract price , and Supaari VaGayjur bought his first yard on the profit . He developed a reputation for knowing what was happening among the Runa , and while his knowledge was profitable and his wealth IIU THE SPARROW 273 envied , its source was disdained and he remained an outsider among the respectable Jana’ata of Gayjur . His world consisted of other thirds , who were his competitors , and the Runa , who were , for all that he enjoyed their company , his prey . His exclusion from society galled him , but there was a more fundamental source of discontent - something which sucked the savor from Supaari 's life , which made him wonder what the point of all his effort was . His brothers , whose inheritance tied them to the small and backward town of their birth , seemed less enviable to him now as he looked around his large and well - managed compound , with its servants and warehouse workers , its runners and office staff , its bustling purposefulness . And yet his brothers had what every third was barred from : descendants , heirs , posterity . There were ways out of this trap . The death without issue of an older sibling would open the way for a third child , providing it could be proved that the heir had not assassinated the first- or second - born . Sterility , if the older was willing to declare the condition 's permanence publicly and yield status to the younger , could also make a family possible . And , in exceedingly rare cases , a third could be rendered Founder and establish a new lineage . On this last possibility — and on seven small brown kernels of extraordinary scent and the exquisite boredom of Hlavin Kitheri — Supaari VaGayjur now pinned his hopes . By midday , his ordinary business concluded , Supaari was ready to hire a skimmer to pole across the bay to Fatzna Island , the glassmakers ' quarter . As the shallow - drafted boat slid onto fine white sand , the thought occurred to him belatedly that he might have done well to bring Chaypas with him , to advise him on the selection of a vacuum flask . Too late , he thought as he paid off the poler and asked the woman to return for him after first sundown . Then he began a systematic hunt through the shops . In the end , he bought not one but three small presentation flasks , each the finest of its type in his judgment , ranging from the classically ornate to a pure crystal simplicity . When the poler returned , he asked to be let off near Ezao . Noting with satisfaction the large number of people already wearing the waterfall of ribbons , Supaari tracked Chaypas to one of the cook shops and , explaining briefly , asked her opinion of the flasks . Chaypas stood . Leaving her meal and Supaari behind , she walked outside and then a short way uphill to a vantage point that gave her a 274 MARY DORIA RUSSELL view of Galatna Palace , with its twisted marble columns , its finely wrought and silvered gates , its silken awnings , its glazed tile walls gilded and sparkling in the reflections from the paired three - sided fountains sending droplets of precious scented oils like fire sparks into the sunlight . “
130017	130056	130057	130057	Sipaj	576	” Chaypas said when she returned , and set the simplest of the flasks before him . Then she held out both her hands to him and said , with a warmth that touched him to his soul , “
130066	131719	130064	130064	children	1322	” o HLAVIN KITHERI WAS a poet , and it had always seemed especially outrageous to him that his title , Reshtar , had such a grand significant sound to it . Reshtar . When spoken , it emerged in two pieces , slowly , with dignity . It could not be said quickly or dismissively . It had a kind of majesty that the position itself had never matched . It meant , simply , spare or extra . For like the merchant Supaari VaGayjur , Hlavin Kitheri was a thirdborn son . The two men had other things in common . They had been born in the same season , some thirty years earlier . As thirds , they existed in a state of statutory sterility - neither was allowed to marry or have children , legally . Both of them had made more of their lives than anyone could have expected , given their birth positions . And yet , since their honor derived not from inheritance but from accomplishment , they both existed largely outside the bounds of their society . There the similarities ended . In contrast to Supaari 's decidedly middling ancestry , Hlavin Kitheri was the scion of Rakhat 's oldest and most noble lineage , and he had once been third in line to succeed as the paramount of Inbrokar . In a reshtar 's case , being a third was not a family scandal but the unfortunate consequence of a poorly timed aristocratic birth . Traditionally , noblewomen were bred frequently because their sons died in high numbers . Supaari 's parents had no such justification for their lapse . And while men like Supaari often wondered why they 'd been born at all , a reshtar 's purpose was explicit : it was to exist , as a spare , ready to step into an elder brother 's place if he were killed or incapacitated before an heir was born . Reshtari were trained therefore to versatility , prepared equally for war or for governance ; either or neither could be their fate . THE SPARROW 275 In the old days , the probability of succession by a reshtar was high . Now , in the enduring peace of the Triple Alliance , most aristocratic thirds simply lived out their lives in pointlessness : softened by servants , dulled by ease , blunted by sterile pleasure . There was , however , another path open to reshtari , called , appropriately , the Third Way : the way of scholarship . History and literature , chemistry and physics and genetics , both pure and applied , formal architecture and design , poetry and music , all these were the products of aristocratic thirds . Barred - or liberated — from dynasty , the reshtari of Rakhat were freed - or driven — to make sense of their lives in other ways . If a reshtar was careful not to attract a dangerous faction while in exile and did not arouse a routinely paranoid brother 's suspicions , he could sometimes produce a sort of intellectual posterity by making some lasting and significant contribution to science or the arts . Thus , the princely thirds of Rakhat were the volatile elements , the free radicals of Jana'ata high culture , just as bourgeois thirds like Supaari VaGayjur formed the striving , bustling commercial element of Jana’ata society . The crushing restriction of their lives was like the pressure that turns coal to diamond . Most were lost to it , ground to powder ; some emerged , brilliant and of great value . The Reshtar of Galatna Palace , Hlavin Kitheri , was among those for whom constraint had been transforming . He had redeemed his life and given meaning to it in an unprecedented way . Lacking a future , he became a connoisseur of the ephemeral . A singularity , he devoted himself to an appreciation of the unique . He made himself alive to the moment , embracing its transience and , paradoxically , immortalizing it in song . His days were a form of artistry , arising from an aesthetic of evanescence . He brought beauty to vapidity , weight to hollowness , eloquence to emptiness . Hlavin Kitheri 's life was a triumph of art over fate . His earliest poetry was stunning in its originality . In a culture wreathed by perfumes and incense since ancient times , Hlavin Kitheri turned his attention in the beginning to the most reviled of odors . Faced with the ugly , reeking , clamorous city of his exile , he composed songs that captured and exalted the metallic vapors of the marble quarries , the stinking alkaline bite of the red swamps , the smoky sulfurs and strange fermentations and mephitic phantasms emanating from the mines and factories , the seething mixtures of oily and saline compounds transpiring from the dockyards of Gayjur . Scent : capricious and enduring , vanguard of taste , instrument of vigilance , essence of intimacy and recollection- 276 MARY DORIA RUSSELL scent was the spirit of the world , Hlavin Kitheri sang . His finest work was a haunting poetry of storms , songs that spoke of the slackening and rarefication and elasticity of such scents , transformed by lightning and rain as the wind danced . These songs were so compelling that his concerts began to be broadcast , the first nonmilitary use of radio in his culture 's history . The acclaim did not dilute the cogence of his poetry . He accepted it as validation and , strengthened , turned his mind and his art to a fearless examination of a reshtar 's living death . He survived his own unblinking scrutiny . The poetry that resulted , written when Kitheri was only twenty - six , had what many thought would be his greatest influence on his culture . Robbed of any possibility of reproduction , empty of any future , sex for a reshtar was reduced to its most irremediable physicality , no more satisfying to the soul than a sneeze or the voiding of a bladder . In youth , Hlavin Kitheri had fallen into the trap that snared so many others of his kind , compensating for utter vacuity with numerically staggering indulgence , hoping to make up in sheer repetition of experience what was missing in depth and meaning . In maturity , he came to despise the harem of sterile courtesans and cross - species partners his brothers provided ; Hlavin saw it for what it was : a sop thrown to him to dissipate envy of his elders ' fecundity . And so he turned his aesthetic sensibilities to the experience of orgasm and found the courage to sing of that evanescent moment which , for the fertile , brings the weight of the past to bear on the future , which holds all moments in its embrace , which links ancestry and posterity in the chain of being from which he was barred and exiled . With his poetry , he severed that moment from the stream of genetic history , carried it beyond the body 's drive to reproduce and the lineal need for continuity and , focusing the mind and soul on it , discovered in climax a reservoir of piercing erotic beauty no one else in the history of his kind had suspected . In a culture walled in by tradition and heavy with stability , Hlavin Kitheri had created a new subtlety , a delicacy , a new appreciation of raw experience . What had once been merely obnoxious or ignored was now theater and song : scent 's veiled and hidden opera . What had once been dynastic duty or meaningless carnality was resolved and purified , raised to an aesthetic voluptuousness that had never before existed on Rakhat . And , scandalously , the Reshtar of Galatna lured even those who could n THE SPARROW 277 have bred productively to artistic lives of momentary and sterile but ravishing brilliance , for he had changed the world of those who heard his songs for all time . There arose a generation of poets , the children of his soul , and their songs — sometimes choral , sometimes singular , often the call - and - response of the oldest chants — propagated through space on unseen waves and reached a world they could not imagine , and changed lives there as well . It was to this man , Hlavin Kitheri , the Reshtar of Galatna Palace , that Supaari VaGayjur now sent , in a strikingly simple crystal flask , seven small kernels of extraordinary fragrance . Opening the flask , breaking its vacuum , Kitheri was met by a plume of sweetly camphoric enzyme by - products giving off notes of basil and tarragon , by chocolate aromatics , sugar carbonyl and pyrazine compounds carrying the suggestion of vanilla , by hints of nutmeg and celery seed and cumin in the products of dry distillation created during roasting . And , overlaying all , the tenuous odor of volatile short - chain carbons , the saline memorial of an alien ocean : sweat from the fingers of Emilio Sandoz . A poet with no words to describe organic beauties whose origin he could not possibly suspect , Hlavin Kitheri knew only that he must know more . And , because of this , lives were changed again . 25 NAPLES : JULY 2060 STANDING IN THE hallway , John Candotti and Edward Behr could hear half of the conversation taking place inside the Father General 's office quite clearly . It was not necessary to eavesdrop . It was only necessary not to be deaf . “
131740	131741	131726	131726	You	2959	” “
131750	131762	131743	131743	I	0	” John whispered , rubbing the bump on his broken nose . “
131771	131787	131763	131763	He	2961	” said Brother Edward placidly . Anger , he believed , was healthier than depression . “
131805	131859	131794	131794	He	2961	” Why , Sandoz had asked John at lunch , why was he being asked about things that were in the records that were sent back ? Why did n't they just read the daily reports and scientific papers ? John told him that only the Father General had access to the reports . “
131869	131932	131794	131794	He	2961	” Sandoz asked and when he got the answer , he left the table , stone - faced and seething , and headed directly for the Father General 's office . Candotti and Behr turned at the sound of Johannes Voelker 's steps . THE SPARROW 279 He joined them at the door and listened with frank interest as Sandoz said sarcastically , “
131965	131969	131970	131970	Vince	295	” Another pause . “
131978	132038	131972	131972	people	4085	” Voelker , hearing this , raised an eyebrow . Probably pisses him off to hear Sandoz call Giuliani by his first name , John thought . Voelker insisted on imbuing the office of the Father General with as much imperial glory as he could , the better to play Grand Vizier , in John 's admittedly biased opinion . “
132043	132050	131972	131972	people	4085	” Voelker asked with dry surprise . “
132055	132056	132053	132053	Christ	344	” “
132063	132126	132153	132153	you	2964	” There was a pause and they could hear the Father General 's quiet voice but could n't make out the words without actually laying an ear against the door , an extremity no one was willing to go to , with witnesses . Felipe Reyes arrived , brows up inquiringly , and came to a sudden halt as Sandoz shouted furiously , “
132189	132190	132191	132191	Your	2964	” “
132198	132205	132196	132196	Candotti	298	” Voelker said quietly , smiling . “
132227	132239	132218	132218	He	2966	” John said just as softly with as gentle a smile . “
132256	132365	132218	132218	He	2966	” It would have gotten nastier had Felipe Reyes not stopped them with a look . It is almost hormonal with these two , Reyes thought . Put Voelker and Candotti in a room together and you could practically see the metaphysical antlers growing out of their heads . They realized then that the shouting had stopped and for a long while there was no indication of what was going on inside the office . Finally , Voelker glanced at the time on his notebook and reached passed John to rap on the door . To John 's vast satisfaction , it was the Father General who yelled , “
132371	132387	132218	132218	He	2966	” INSIDE THE OFFICE , Emilio Sandoz was staring at Vincenzo Giuliani in utter disbelief . “
132402	132415	132389	132389	you	2969	” Giuliani was 280 MARY DORIA RUSSELL saying , hands spread placatingly . “
132438	132510	132389	132389	you	2969	” Sandoz stood there , rigid , almost unable to take it in . He wanted to believe that it made no difference , but it did . It made everything different , and he tried to remember every conversation they 'd had , almost faint with the fear that he 'd remember saying something , unknowing , that might have wounded her . Giuliani pulled out a chair for him . “
132523	132588	132589	132589	You	291	” A scholar himself , Giuliani was not at all happy about the suppression of scientific work , but there were larger issues here , things Sandoz could not be told . He was not proud of himself for bringing Mendes into this , but it was a useful diversion and might unearth some relevant insight if he could get Sandoz to open up . “
132594	132603	132604	132604	She	2971	” Emilio shook his head , still dazed . “
132641	132760	132638	132639	a child	799	” he whispered , horrified . How did she survive being used like that ? With all the resources of an adult , it had destroyed him . She had saved his life , her Al navigation system piloting the Stella Maris back to the solar system nearly a year after her own death on Rakhat . He was a broken man , alone , incapable even when whole of coping with the navigational tasks . Sofia 's programs had done it all : efficient , logical and competent as their creator . Sometimes he would call up the initial screen that put the Al program in motion and stare at the message she had left in Hebrew . “
132763	132767	132638	132639	a child	799	” it said , “
132771	132821	132634	132634	She	2971	” It was more than he could stand to think of , and he forced himself away from it , fighting the descent into migraine . She 's dead and I may as well be , he thought . The work does n't deserve to be entombed as well . “
132827	132841	132634	132634	She	2971	” he insisted then , and Giuliani realized the diversion had n't worked . “
132899	132900	132897	132897	Vince	295	” “
132933	132943	132944	132944	We	2974	” Giuliani said peremptorily when Sandoz opened his mouth . “
132988	132996	132986	132986	Emilio	291	” He was not above applying leverage . “
133040	133041	133033	133033	I	0	” “
133044	133048	133033	133033	I	0	” Sandoz cried . “
133059	133060	133061	133062	Father Sandoz	291	” “
133064	133082	133083	133083	you	2976	” the Father General of the Society of Jesus reminded him , hands folded on the table , “
133090	133163	133083	133083	you	2976	” There was a moment of stunned silence before Sandoz slumped in his seat and turned away , eyes closed , mouth hard , effectively checkmated . A minute or so later , one gloved hand went involuntarily to the side of his head , pressing against the temple . Giuliani got up and went to the lavatory for a glass of water and the bottle of Prograine he now kept handy . “
133168	133191	133083	133083	you	2976	” he asked when he got back . One tablet did n't quite do the job ; two flattened Sandoz for hours . “
133197	133321	133195	133195	you	2976	” Giuliani placed the tablet in the palm of the glove Sandoz held out abruptly and watched as the man tossed the pill into his mouth and took the glass between his wrists . He could manage some things quite well with Candotti 's fingerless gloves on . The gloves reminded Giuliani of those once worn by cyclists ; the athletic allusion made Sandoz seem less impaired without the braces , if you did n't watch carefully . New braces were being fabricated . Giuliani took the glass back to the lavatory and when he returned , Sandoz was resting his head on the heels of his hands , elbows on the table . Hearing Giuliani 's steps , he said almost soundlessly , “
133327	133367	133195	133195	you	2976	” Giuliani did so and then went to the windows to pull the heavy outer curtains closed as well . It was another gray day , but even dull light seemed to bother Emilio when he had a headache . “
133375	133379	133369	133369	you	2978	” he asked . “
133389	133592	133593	133593	I	0	” Giuliani walked to his desk . Rather than open the door and tell the others himself , he routed a message to the front door , asking the porter to relay it to the men waiting outside his office : the afternoon 's meeting was canceled . Brother Edward was to wait in the hall for Father Sandoz . To pass the time , Giuliani did some of what he still thought of as paperwork , reviewing several letters before signing off on transmission . In Acu . 282 MARY DORIA RUSSELL the quiet that now settled over the office , he could hear the elderly gardener , Father Crosby , whistling tunelessly outside the windows as he deadheaded the annuals and pinched back chrysanthemums . It was perhaps twenty minutes later when Emilio 's head came up and he sat back gingerly in his chair , the heel of one hand still pressing hard against the side of his forehead . Giuliani closed the file he was working on and went back to the table , sitting in the chair across from Emilio . Sandoz 's eyes remained closed but , hearing the chair move , he said almost inaudibly , “
133601	133602	133593	133593	I	0	” “
133609	133614	133605	133605	You	0	” Giuliani agreed neutrally . “
133628	133629	133621	133621	I	0	” “
133637	133638	133632	133632	You	0	” “
133666	133667	133671	133671	you	0	” “
133674	133692	133671	133671	you	0	” Sandoz , squinting into what seemed to him painfully bright light , looked directly at Giuliani . “
133715	133716	133708	133708	Vince	295	" “
133722	133734	133719	133719	you	0	” Giuliani asked simply . Sandoz looked blank , not understanding . “
133744	133750	133737	133737	you	0	” Giuliani asked again gently . "
133793	133810	133835	133835	Emilio	291	” The eyes closed and there was a long silence before his lips formed the word , "
133813	133814	133835	133835	Emilio	291	" “
133823	133834	133817	133817	I	0	” Giuliani took a deep breath and let it out . “
133928	133939	133942	133942	they	2986	” He hesitated , not knowing how far to go . “
133958	134005	134006	134006	Emilio	291	" Sandoz stood and turned to leave . Giuliani reached out and locked a hand over the man 's arm to keep him from running away but released THE SPARROW 283 OS en it instantly , startled by the strangled scream as Sandoz pulled away violently . “
134022	134058	134059	134059	Emilio	291	” He had seen before this look of sheer panic , the terror that sometimes swamped the man when you least expected it . This has to be part of it somehow , he thought . “
134072	134073	134059	134059	Emilio	291	” “
134081	134086	134079	134079	Vince	295	” Sandoz said bitterly . “
134090	134149	134088	134088	God	290	” HE KNEW IT was Edward Behr who 'd come after him . The wheezing was unmistakable . He 'd felt his way down the stone stairs , blinded by the tears and the lingering pain , and when he realized he 'd been followed , he swore viciously and told Ed to leave him the hell alone . “
134156	134162	134151	134151	you	291	” Brother Edward asked curiously . “
134168	134177	134163	134163	You	291	” Emilio laughed in spite of it all . “
134187	134222	134180	134180	I	0	” he said as dryly as a crying man could . He sat down where he stood , feeling boneless and bereft , and put his head in what was left of his hands . “
134230	134231	134232	134232	You	291	” “
134239	134263	134232	134232	You	291	” Edward said , sitting down . Emilio looked out at the Mediterranean , gunmetal blue and oily under a flat pewter sky . “
134304	134319	134320	134320	I	0	” Wiping his eyes on the backs of his gloves , Emilio said angrily , “
134345	134346	134335	134335	I	0	” “
134367	134390	134357	134357	You	291	” Edward saw rather than heard the sobbing and resisted the impulse to put a hand out ; Sandoz hated being touched . “
134500	134501	134508	134508	Ed	293	” “
134510	134552	134508	134508	Ed	293	” Sandoz asked . He 'd gotten a grip 284 MARY DORIA RUSSELL again . Brother Edward wished he 'd let himself go , but there was some overriding need to keep control , something that could n't be wept away . "
134561	134566	134553	134553	You	293	” Sandoz said then . “
134578	134579	134571	134571	I	0	” “
134605	134623	134571	134571	I	0	” Edward leaned forward , pudgy elbows on his knees , head close to Emilio 's now . "
134716	134717	134718	134718	I	0	” “
134722	134729	134718	134718	I	0	” There was a long silence . “
134736	134737	134718	134718	I	0	” “
134786	134787	134783	134783	I	0	” “

134807	134814	134797	134797	you	0	” Brother Edward said , musing . “
134880	134928	134869	134869	Laura	604	” They listened for a while to the mournful screams of the gulls wheeling overhead . The water was too far away to hear the waves , but watching the rhythmic ebb and flow was nearly as soothing and Emilio 's headache began to ebb as well . “
134939	134943	134937	134937	Ed	293	” he asked . “
134976	134981	134965	134965	they	3003	” Edward said dryly . “
135054	135055	135050	135050	you	293	” “
135059	135072	135050	135050	you	293	” Sandoz said , his voice normal again and a little hard . “

135115	135121	135113	135113	sir	4127	” Brother Edward said quietly . "
135133	135148	135122	135122	I	0	” It was some time before Sandoz answered , flat - voiced and unexpansive , “
135158	135179	135122	135122	I	0	” Brother Edward thought that might be the end of the conversation , but after a few minutes Sandoz said , “
135193	135194	135195	135195	I	0	” “
135217	135237	135241	135242	Miss Mendes	422	” Edward hesitated , then thought it might be as good a time as any to broach the subject . “
135253	135254	135249	135249	She	422	” “
135262	135285	135249	135249	She	422	” Sandoz said , the sound leached from his voice . He cleared his throat and ran an arm over his eyes . “
135301	135315	135286	135287	A man	4134	” Edward Behr said gently . Some priests were so hard on themselves . “
135321	135327	135318	135319	a fool	1873	” Sandoz agreed and added , “
135336	135354	135329	135329	I	0	” It was a puzzling thing to say and Sandoz followed it with something just as unexpected . “
135381	135693	135694	135694	Emilio	291	” Sandoz stood and , without looking back , made his way down the long stairway to the sea . He was small and foreshortened , halfway across the beach to the huge stone outcropping he often retreated to , before Edward Behr realized what he had just been told . 26 VILLAGE OF KASHAN AND GREAT SOUTHERN FOREST : EIGHT WEEKS AFTER CONTACT NE 1 WC THAT ANNE AWOKE THAT night without knowing what had disturbed her . Her first thought , accompanied by a spurt of adrenaline that snapped her eyes open in the dark , was that D.W. was sick again or that someone else had fallen prey to Runa 's Revenge . She listened , alert for any telltale sound , but heard only George snoring softly in heavy , dreamless sleep . Knowing that she would n't relax until she 'd checked on everyone , Anne sighed and thought , I have turned into a semi - mom with a very odd bunch of children . So she pulled on one of Jimmy 's giant T - shirts and worked her way out of the tent . She went first to D.W. and , reassured , moved on to Jimmy 's sleeping shape in another corner . She looked , with a pang , at the empty beds of Marc and Sofia and wished she were a praying person so their absence would not fill her with such helpless anxiety . Then she saw a third bed empty but before her heart could lurch , she began to hear the faint clicking of a keyboard . Picking her way along a stone path only a goat could appreciate , she ducked into Aycha 's place next door and saw her favorite semi - son kneeling like a scholarly geisha at a low table , typing rapidly . “
135696	135701	135694	135694	Emilio	291	” she cried softly . “
135708	135872	135706	135706	you	291	” He shook his head without looking up and continued to type . She THE SPARROW 287 sank onto a cushion next to him and listened to the night noises . It smelled like rain to her but the stones were still dry . Well , she thought , noticing the radio monitor propped next to Emilio , I 'm not the only one sweating it out . Marc and Sofia had reported that they were going to try a landing . There had been a sickening silence ever since . Jimmy thought this might be due to the severity of the storm on the other side of the mountains , but George said that would only have disrupted signals , not silenced them altogether . No one said anything aloud about a crash . Emilio typed a while longer and then closed out the file , satisfied that he 'd written enough to be able to reconstruct the logic the next morning . “

139345	139365	139337	139337	she	330	“ But if I had been dying , would it not have been your duty to save my soul ? ”
139366	139390	139391	139391	he	342	“ This is not the seventeenth century , mademoiselle . We do not go about snatching the souls of dying heathens from perdition , ”
139401	139476	139396	139396	he	342	“ If you had earlier indicated that you sincerely desired to be baptized but had not yet taken instruction in Irse 294 MARY DORIA RUSSELL the Faith , I would have baptized you , yes , out of respect for your intention . Or if you had regained consciousness and requested it , I would have complied with your wish . But without your permission ? Without a prior statement of intent ? Never . ”

142862	142897	142856	142856	Emilio	291	“ Of course . I knew that . I 'm sorry , I was n't listening closely enough . So if the Stella Maris were to hit Rakhat , it would wreck the planet . ”

142913	142955	142910	142910	George	315	“ We scrubbed off a lot of speed getting into orbit . If the ship came down in the ocean , it would n't do that much damage . Tidal wave maybe , but it would n't destroy the whole ecosystem . ”
142956	142972	142973	142973	Emilio	291	“ I do n't think it would be ethical to risk even a tidal wave , ”

142989	143015	143017	143017	Jimmy	309	" I 'm not sure we can find a new orbit that would do us much good anyhow , if we need an ocean splashdown , ”
143019	143036	143017	143017	Jimmy	309	“ Might be possible , but it would restrict us to a really narrow orbital band . ”
143037	143060	143061	143061	George	315	“ Well , boys and girls , I am really sorry but it 's about eight to one odds we 're stuck . ”
143080	143119	143071	143071	he	315	“ We can radio home , but it will take better than four years for them to get the news , another two or three years to configure a ship , and then seventeen more to get here . "
143132	143150	143151	143151	Jimmy	309	“ Still , there 's some room to maneuver , and things could be a lot worse , ”
143182	143259	143159	143159	He	309	“ We figured on a year 's worth of stuff for the food depot and brought down all the equipment we thought would be of most use . Marc had seeds on his list . We can survive on the native foods , but if we can start a garden that does n't get washed away in this endless rain , we 'll have our own plants as well . I think we 'll do okay . ”
143266	143299	143300	143300	he	315	“ You know , there 's a chance we could manufacture more fuel for the lander . We 're pretty sure the Singers asse 302 MARY DORIA RUSSELL know chemistry , right ? ”

143392	143492	143388	143388	He	315	“ It 's set up to be self - sustaining , but we 'll lose maybe twenty percent of the plants a year , rough estimate . Marc will know better . There 's only seven of us now , so there 'll be a smaller oxygen demand . If we can make enough fuel to get back up there even once , then Marc or I could go up and optimize things before the rest of you come aboard . And we might be able to use Rakhati plants as replacements , now that I think of it . ”
143505	143511	143512	143512	Jimmy	309	“ And in the meantime , ”
143519	143542	143512	143512	Jimmy	309	“ we can still use the Stella Maris as a resource . We 've got the onboard computer systems and radio relays . ”

144192	144201	144183	144183	he	315	“ The third day is always the worst . ”
144216	144228	144229	144229	He	315	“ Does today count as the second or the third day ? ”
144233	144240	144229	144229	He	315	“ You 'll find out tomorrow . ”
144292	144299	144300	144300	she	330	“ Robichaux , you look dreadful , ”
144306	144314	144300	144300	she	330	“ Thank you . So do you . ”

144460	144467	144468	144468	Emilio	291	“ This is true , Mendes , ”
144499	144512	144514	144514	he	291	“ All right . You 've got a customer , Mr. Quinn . ”
146099	146108	146109	146110	Emilio Sandoz	291	“ I have been considering my present situation , ”
146149	146169	146170	146170	he	291	“ I have decided that I am happier than I have ever been in my life . And yet , ”
146179	146200	146170	146170	he	291	“ I would crawl over your dead , burnt bodies if it meant getting to absolutely anything deep - fried . ”
146201	146205	146206	146206	Jimmy	309	“ Bacalaitos fritos , ”

146297	146303	146304	146304	D.W.	377	“ To the grocery store . ”
146323	146335	146336	146336	Anne	332	“ To the world 's most astoundingly high - tech pantry , ”
146344	146358	146359	146359	Sandoz	291	“ To the lander , D.W. ! To get ready for the party . ”

146733	146744	146745	146745	she	330	“ I do n't keep kosher , as you know , ”
146753	146788	146745	146745	she	330	“ I still found it impossible to eat pork or shellfish , and I 've never eaten game . But if you can kill the animal cleanly , I suppose it does n't matter . ”

147797	147823	147788	147788	He	291	“ Someone regrets your discomfort . Even so , harm is not permitted . If someone lets you up , will your heart be quiet ? ”
147980	147985	147977	147977	Supaari	504	“ What are you ? ”

148005	148008	148009	148009	Supaari	504	“ That , ”
148017	148026	148009	148009	Supaari	504	“ must be the understatement of all time . ”
148036	148041	148032	148033	the monster	3235	“ This is true , ”
148055	148062	148032	148033	the monster	3235	“ May someone offer you coffee ? ”
148063	148075	148076	148076	Supaari	504	“ Kafay ! The very thing one came to inquire after , ”
148758	148766	148767	148767	she	330	" Most Runa prefer only to inhale , ”
148783	148795	148796	148796	she	330	“ Perhaps you will try drinking some , as we do , ”

149133	149140	149130	149130	Jimmy	309	“ This one is the youngest . ”
149192	149199	149186	149186	Supaari	504	“ Who then is the Elder ? ”
149323	149330	149331	149331	D.W.	377	“ This one is the Elder , ”
149336	149350	149333	149333	Emilio	291	“ though not the oldest . His decisions are for all of us . ”
149393	149414	149415	149415	He	291	“ This one is called Supaari , third - born , of the Gaha'ana lineage , whose landname is VaGayjur . ”
149445	149466	149442	149442	he	291	“ The Elder is called Dee , first - born , of the Yarbrough lineage , whose landname is VaWaco . ”

149628	149649	149625	149625	she	332	“ Sipaj , Supaari ! Surely you are hungry from your journey . Will you not eat with us now ? ”
149913	149935	149904	149904	Emilio	291	“ I hope you do n't expect to walk into my office and see me without an appointment , young man . ”
149942	149962	149936	149936	John	627	“ Brother Edward said they 'd put you to work down here . Very nice . Kind of Bauhaus . ”
149963	149976	149977	149977	Emilio	291	“ Form follows function . Dirty laundry requires this sort of ambience . ”
149984	149990	149991	149991	He	627	“ Prepare to be dazzled . ”
150008	150016	150017	150017	John	627	“ So those are the new braces ! ”
150079	150088	150070	150070	Giuliani	294	“ I am dazzled . That 's wonderful . ”
150089	150106	150107	150107	Emilio	291	“ Yes . I am very flashy with towels as well , but there are limits . ”
150114	150139	150107	150107	Emilio	291	“ Socks , for example . You guys send them down inside out , they go back upstairs clean but in the same condition . ”
150140	150152	150153	150153	John	627	“ Hey , my dad had the same rule at home . ”
150181	150191	150164	150164	he	291	“ Those are really good , are n't they . "
150192	150210	150211	150211	Emilio	291	“ They 're much easier to control . Lighter . Look : the bruises are clearing up . ”
150313	150332	150333	150333	Emilio	291	“ My hands and arms ache , but I think it 's because I 'm using them more , ”
150338	150348	150333	150333	Emilio	291	“ Here 's the best part . Watch this . ”
150440	150449	150450	150450	Emilio	291	“ I can do it all by myself , ”
150469	150480	150462	150462	He	291	“ You can not imagine what a difference that makes . ”
150566	150570	150571	150571	John	627	“ Very impressive , ”
150599	150614	150591	150591	John	627	“ That 's got to be what ? Seven or eight kilos , huh ? "
150615	150619	150620	150620	Emilio	291	“ Better microgearing , ”
150652	150668	150669	150669	he	291	“ Miss Marino may need to add some friction pads on the thumb and forefinger , ”
150748	150756	150757	150757	John	627	“ This is going to sound dumb , ”
150761	150770	150757	150757	John	627	“ but those 're actually very good looking . ”
150771	150775	150776	150776	Emilio	291	“ Italian design , ”
150807	150819	150780	150780	He	291	“ ' Next year , everyone will be wearing them . ' ”
150820	150824	150825	150825	John	627	" Princess Bride ! ”
150833	150848	150850	150850	Emilio	291	“ Ah , I see you 're using Bonetti 's defense against me , ' ”
150860	150875	150876	150876	John	627	“ Never go up against a Sicilian when death is on the line ! ' ”
150916	150934	150907	150907	his	627	“ This is great , man . I never thought I 'd see you doing so well . ”
151146	151156	151157	151157	he	291	“ Here . I 'll help you with this , ”
151174	151177	151157	151157	he	291	“ No ! ”
151196	151203	151204	151204	he	291	“ Look . I 'm sorry , ”
151207	151260	151204	151204	he	291	“ I was startled , okay ? I did n't expect you to be standing so close . And I do n't want help ! People keep trying to help ! I 'm sorry , but I hate it . If you would just do me the courtesy of letting me judge — ”
151278	151310	151273	151273	he	291	“ I 'm sorry . You put up with a lot of shit from me . I get confused , John . A lot of things get mixed up in this . ”
151343	151361	151337	151337	he	291	“ Do n't just stand there gawking . Give me a hand with this , will you ? ”
151431	151448	151449	151449	John	298	“ Yes , these are a great improvement but I still ca n't play the violin ... "
151463	151466	151467	151467	John	298	“ Shit , ”
151477	151495	151496	151497	THE SPARROW	621	“ I ca n't believe I fell for that . You never played the violin , right ? ”
151500	151512	151513	151513	Emilio	291	“ Baseball , John . All I ever played was baseball . ”
151536	151558	151527	151527	he	291	“ Probably too old and beaten up to get around a diamond now anyway . But I had good hands once . ”
151559	151566	151567	151567	John	298	“ What position did you play ? ”
151570	151605	151567	151567	John	298	“ Second base , usually . Not enough arm to play outfield . I was pretty consistent at bat , mostly singles and doubles . I was n't that good but I loved it . ”
151606	151636	151527	151527	he	291	“ The Father General claims he 's still got a bruise where you took his ankle out sliding in to steal third once . He says you were savage . ”
151637	151642	151643	151643	Emilio	291	“ This is slander ! ”
151664	151684	151648	151648	he	291	“ Serious , yes . Barbaric , quite possibly . But savage ? Only if the score was close . ”
151723	151730	151731	151731	Emilio	291	“ You follow baseball , John ? ”
151747	151751	151752	151752	John	298	“ Cubs fan , ”
151769	151773	151760	151760	Sandoz	291	“ How bad ? ”
151774	151784	151737	151737	his	291	“ Anybody can have a couple of lousy centuries . ”
151785	151791	151792	151792	Sandoz	291	“ I guess . Wow . ”
151807	151818	151737	151737	his	291	“ Well , that explains why Giuliani brought you over . ”
151829	151853	151822	151824	the Father General	297	“ Voelker , I need someone to take care of a hopeless wreck coming back from Rakhat . Get me a Cubs fan ! ”
151854	151862	151737	151737	his	291	“ You 're not hopeless , Emilio . ”
151863	151882	151822	151824	the Father General	297	“ John , I could tell you things about hopeless that even a Cubs fan would n't understand . ”
151883	151887	151822	151824	the Father General	297	“ Try me . ”
151907	151918	151889	151889	Sandoz	291	“ So . How 's San Juan doing this year ? ”
151919	151934	151935	151935	John	298	“ Three games out of first . They took the Series in ' 58 , ”
151985	152062	151966	151966	John	298	“ Do you know that this is the first time you 've asked about current events ? Listen , this has been driving me crazy ! I mean , you 've been gone since before I was born ! Do n't you won- 320 MARY DORIA RUSSELL der how things turned out ? What wars are over and who won and stuff like that ? Technological revolutions , medical advances ? Are n't you even curious ? "
152127	152133	152134	152134	he	291	“ My dear Father Candotti , ”
152138	152252	152134	152134	he	291	“ allow me to explain something . In the past fifteen years or so , I must have lived in what ? Thirty different places ? Four continents , two islands . Two planets ! An asteroid ! Seven or eight ecosystems , from desert to tundra . Dormitories , huts , caves , tents , shacks , hampiys ... I have been required to function in over a dozen foreign languages , often three at a time . I have contended with thousands of strangers , in cultures involving three sentient species and perhaps twenty nationalities . I am sorry to disappoint you , but my capacity for curiosity is tapped out . ”
152274	152318	152253	152253	Emilio	291	“ John , if I had my way , nothing new or interesting would happen to me ever again as long as I live . Laundry is just about my speed . No quick movements , no sudden noises , no intellectual demands . ”
152319	152325	152326	152326	John	298	“ And no damned questions ? ”
152338	152343	152344	152344	Emilio	291	“ No damned questions , ”
152360	152384	152347	152347	He	291	“ And very little potential for death , destruction and degradation , my friend . I 've had a couple of rough years . "
152420	152435	152416	152416	him	298	“ Well , you screwed up . Everybody screws up . It 's okay . "
152475	152483	152484	152484	Sandoz	291	“ Want to tell me about it ? ”
152510	152517	152518	152518	he	291	“ I can finish this myself , ”
152648	152653	152654	152656	the Father General	754	“ Upon much reflection , ”
152660	152687	152688	152688	He	754	“ I have decided to release to you transcripts of the mission reports by Yarbrough and Robichaux , as well as certain private communications from them . ”
152699	152781	152782	152782	Giuliani	294	“ I am sure I do n't have to tell you that this information is confidential . You will find as you read that Emilio has been entirely forthcoming about the mission facts . I believe he means to cooperate fully with us in our first task . He will tell us what happened on Rakhat as long as it does not touch on his personal state of mind , past or present . Which brings us to our second task . ”
152785	152825	152782	152782	Giuliani	294	“ It has become clear to me that there is some private theological aspect to Emilio 's emotional problems . I am , personally , convinced of the sincerity of his spiritual engagement at the beginning of the mission . ”
152841	152879	152838	152839	Johannes Voelker	301	“ I do not ask you to be credulous as you read the mission reports , but I ask you to accept as a working hypothesis the accuracy of the statements of his superiors on this subject . ”
152910	152934	152900	152900	He	294	“ Something happened to him . It changed everything . Until we know what that was , we are sailing in the dark . ”
153896	153900	153901	153901	Sandoz	291	“ Quite likely , ”
153904	153951	153901	153901	Sandoz	291	“ In comparison to the Jana'ata or to our own species , the Runa are not notably creative thinkers . Or perhaps I should say , not original . Once a basic idea has been provided , they are often quite creative in elaborating on it . ”

154022	154046	154010	154011	the Runa	501	” He stopped . His body tensed , as though ready to stand , but then the 324 MARY DORIA RUSSELL Spaniard spoke . “
154065	154078	154079	154080	Anne Edwards	332	” And Dr. Sandoz resumed a moment later , turning to Giuliani . “

154124	154131	154132	154133	Dr. Edwards	332	” Sandoz turned back to Felipe . “

154457	154469	154470	154470	Parents	3363	” he pointed out . John nodded appreciatively and Emilio continued . “

154541	154563	154512	154512	children	1322	” John asked . Emilio shrugged and made a face that said , This is obvious , surely . THE SPARROW 325 “
154574	154585	154512	154512	children	1322	" And they smiled at the neatness of the thing . “
154609	154638	154595	154595	you	3369	” Johannes Voelker asked . It seemed like an abrupt change in topic and the Spaniard turned to him , clearly expecting and prepared to meet an attack . “
154641	154647	154595	154595	you	3369	” But then he admitted , “
154728	154735	154701	154702	Mr. Quinn	353	" The Austrian was surprisingly conciliatory . “
154756	154760	154742	154743	Father Robichaux	563	” Voelker said . “
154823	154844	154803	154804	the Runa	501	” Sandoz looked at him for a long time , as if deciding how to take this change in tone . “
154847	154852	154803	154804	the Runa	501	” he agreed finally . “

155123	155152	155120	155121	a male	3380	” There was a small burst of laughter and comment as the others admitted how surprised they 'd been when they 'd read this in the mission reports . “
155163	155167	155120	155121	a male	3380	” Sandoz continued , “

155245	155252	155206	155207	the Runa	501	” Sandoz said and continued blandly , “

155355	155372	155346	155346	you	3383	” Vincenzo Giuliani asked in a light , bored voice , which he hoped was convincing . “

155458	155472	155445	155445	He	504	” Sandoz shook his head , more certain as he thought it through . “
155535	155536	155518	155519	the VaKashani	501	” “
155543	155548	155539	155540	the Runa	501	” Felipe asked suddenly . “

155631	155645	155618	155618	they	3389	” Sandoz stopped , apparently struck by the problem for the first time . “
155688	155689	155700	155700	Supaari	504	” “
155702	155706	155700	155700	Supaari	504	” Giuliani asked . “

155766	155772	155758	155759	the Runa	5279	” John guessed , disgusted . “

155814	155818	155819	155819	I	0	” Felipe asked . “
155865	155877	155852	155852	They	506	” He sat quietly for quite a while and then added , “

155928	155974	155923	155924	the Runa	501	” Felipe Reyes said . He had developed a mental model of the Runa as peaceful innocents living in Eden , at odds with the reports from the Contact Consortium . This , for Felipe , was one of the overriding puzzles of the mission . “
155984	156000	155978	155979	the Runa	5279	” There was a pause ; Giuliani saw the tension , but Sandoz went on . “
156048	156057	156058	156058	Emilio	291	” This was virgin territory , Giuliani realized . “

156110	156127	156103	156104	The Runa	5279	” Sandoz stopped to drink again . He looked up , brows raised , eyes dispassionate . “
156164	156180	156162	156162	Columbus	643	” Voelker broke the silence that fell at that , returning to his earlier theme . “
156204	156205	156206	156207	Dr. Edwards	332	” “
156276	156296	156272	156272	I	0	” He stopped and looked to Giuliani , a scholar whom he expected to understand why he was uncomfortable . “

156524	156539	156515	156515	you	0	” John asked , horrified . THE SPARROW 329 Sandoz turned , face composed . “
156646	156662	156663	156663	I	0	” Sandoz paused , and again Giuliani saw the effort it took to go on . “

156771	156775	156741	156741	they	3438	” Sandoz agreed . “
156808	156819	156820	156820	Gentlemen	4231	” Sandoz walked back to the table and sat down . “
156854	156880	156889	156890	Supaari VaGayjur	504	” He expected the outcry , was prepared for it , had rehearsed his presentation of this topic , and he continued with emotionless thoroughness . “
156953	156969	156970	156970	Jana'ata	506	” They were speechless . It had seemed perfectly reasonable to Supaari , of course . “
156996	157002	157005	157006	Runa partners	3461	” Sandoz told them coolly . “
157049	157060	157005	157006	Runa partners	3461	” 330 MARY DORIA RUSSELL Felipe , shocked , asked , “
157068	157075	157062	157063	the Runa	501	” It was Mephistopheles who laughed . “
157089	157110	157082	157083	The concubines	3464	” He looked at each of them in turn as they took in the implications and then hit them again . “
157139	157263	157129	157130	The Jana'ata	506	” 29 VILLAGE OF KASHAN : YEAR TWO as SUPAARI VAGAYJUR , They found , was an ideal informant , a man who moved with knowledgeable ease between the Runa and the Jana’ata , able to see both ways of life from a point of view that few in either society shared . Irony and objectivity formed the converging lines of his perspective . Shrewd and humorous , he saw what people did and not simply what they said they did , and he was well suited to the task of interpreting his culture to the foreigners . Anne , shrewd and humorous herself , dated her affection for him from the moment he managed to tell Sofia that the scent of coffee was “
157266	157857	157129	157130	The Jana'ata	506	” even as he was almost certainly thinking that the flavor was revolting . Alien savoir faire , Anne thought admiringly , as she watched him overcome what must have been a staggering shock . Laudable aplomb . What a guy . It was Anne Edwards 's greatest delight that humans and VaRakhati of both species shared basic emotions , for though she was a woman of highly trained intelligence , she passed all experience through her heart . As an anthropologist , she had loved the fossil Neandertals she studied with a ferocity that embarrassed her , considered them maligned and misunderstood because they were ugly . For her , their browridges and heavy 332 MARY DORIA RUSSELL musa bones receded into insignificance in comparison with their care for the infirm among them and their loving burial of the many children who died around the age of four . Anne had almost wept one day , in a Belgian museum , when it came to her that these children had probably died in springtime , replaced at the breast by younger siblings while still too small to withstand the rigors of the leanest season of the year without a mother 's milk . What were physical differences , when one knew that such children were buried with flowers on boughs of evergreen ? So Anne looked beyond Supaari 's claws and teeth , hardly cared about his tail , and took only anatomical interest in his prehensile feet , revealed when he was comfortable enough to remove his boots after dinner that first afternoon . It was his ability to laugh , to be astounded , to be skeptical and embarrassed , proud and angry and kind that made her love him . He could not pronounce her name , simple as it was . She became Ha'an , and the two of them spent countless hours together in those first weeks , asking and answering as best they could thousands of questions . It was exhausting and exhilarating , a sort of whirlwind love affair that made George cranky and a little jealous . Sometimes , she and Supaari were overcome by the sheer strangeness of their situation , and they were reassured that they were both moved to laugh when this happened . Despite this goodwill , they were often at an impasse . Sometimes Ruanja had no words to convey a Jana'ata concept that Supaari was trying to describe or Anne 's vocabulary was too limited for her to follow the thought . Emilio sat at their sides , translating when his knowledge of Ruanja bettered Anne 's , expanding his grasp of that language , getting a start on Supaari 's own K’San language , which Emilio already suspected had a monstrously difficult grammar . Sofia participated as well , for her vocabulary included many trade terms and she already had some understanding of the commercial aspects of the Runa - Jana'ata relationship , although she 'd previously assumed that the differences between the groups were simply those of country folk and city folk . Marc was often called upon to sketch some object or situation in Runa life for which they had no words and which Supaari could elucidate , after he 'd gotten over the initial surprise of seeing Marc 's drawings . Once that hurdle had been jumped , Jimmy and George pulled up visuals on tablet screens for him . Supaari would sometimes be struck by parallels or would describe differences . “
157867	157874	157875	157875	We	3466	” he would tell them , or “
157884	157889	157875	157875	We	3466	” THE SPARROW 333 or “
157898	158186	157894	157894	we	3466	” When Anne judged Supaari ready to handle it , George modified a VR headset for him and began to show him the virtual realities of Earth . This was even more frightening to him than Anne had anticipated , and he tore the headset off more than once but kept going back to it with a horrified fascination . D.W. , his own self , never warmed to Supaari , but the Winchester eventually went back into storage . Yarbrough said little during the sessions with the Jana'ata but often suggested lines of inquiry for the following day after Supaari , yawning hugely , retired at second sundown . There were seven of them and only one of Supaari , so they held back , not wanting to make the encounter feel like interrogation . He , after all , was still coming to grips with the very idea that they could exist , that their planet could exist , that they had traveled an incomprehensible distance by means of propulsion he was wholly unprepared to understand , simply to learn about him and his planet . No such notion had ever entered his head . That the Jana'ata were the dominant species on Rakhat seemed probable from the beginning of their relationship with Supaari . They were used to carnivores being at the top of food chains and accustomed to killer species being in charge of a planet . And , to be honest , they 'd been vaguely disappointed by the Runa . The stateliness and deliberation and placidity of Runa life made the humans feel almost drugged ; the constant eating , the constant talk , the constant touching dragged on their energy . “
158192	158198	158187	158187	They	3467	” Anne said one night . “
158204	158229	158199	158199	They	3467	” George replied . And Anne admitted in the privacy of their tent that she was often tempted during interminable Runa discussions to shout , “
158245	158716	158717	158717	Sipaj	576	” So despite their inauspicious introduction to Supaari , they were glad to be dealing with someone who came to a decision on his own , even if that decision was to take somebody 's head off at the shoulders . They were happy to find someone on Rakhat who was quick on the uptake , who caught jokes and made them , who saw implications . He moved faster than a Runao , did more things in a given day without making such a damned production out of it . His energy levels came closer to their own . He could , in fact , exhaust them . But then he crashed at second sundown and slept like a gigantic carnivorous baby for fifteen hours . That the relationship between the Jana'ata and the Runa was asymmetrical became unquestionable when the VaKashani Runa re- 334 MARY DORIA RUSSELL turned to their village , huge baskets filled with pik , a few days after Supaari 's arrival in the village . Great deference was shown to the Jana'ata . He was , for all the world , like a Mafia don or a medieval baron , receiving Runa families , laying hands on the children . But there was also affection . His rule , if that was the proper word , was benign . He listened carefully and patiently to all comers , settled disputes with solutions that struck everyone as fair , steering participants toward a conclusion that seemed logical . The VaKashani did not fear him . There was no way for the foreigners to know how misleading all of this was , how unusual Supaari was . A self - made man , Supaari was not reticent about his early life and his present status , and since all the surviving members of the Jesuit party came from cultures on Earth that value such people and disdain hereditary privilege , they were prepared to see him in a somewhat heroic light , a plucky boy who 'd made good . Alan Pace might have been better equipped to handle the class aspects of Rakhati society , since Britain still retained some traits of a culture that takes good breeding seriously . Alan might have understood how truly marginal Supaari was , how little access he had to real sources of power and influence , and how much he might crave such access . But Alan was dead . WHEN , TOWARD THE end of Partan , it was time to see the Jana'ata off after those first extraordinary weeks , the entire population of Kashan , alien and native , accompanied Supaari to the dock or hung from terraces to call farewells and toss flowers on the water and float long scented ribbons in the wind . “
158721	158742	158717	158717	Sipaj	576	” Anne said quietly as he prepared to cast off , the chatter and press of Runa all around them . “
158759	158769	158744	158744	someone	4267	” He was touched that she should wish this . “
158775	158860	158744	158744	someone	4267	” he said in the low and slightly rumbling voice she was now familiar with . Anne motioned him to bring his head closer and he stooped low , not knowing what to expect . She rose on her toes and her arms went around his neck and he felt her tighten the pressure slightly before she let him go . When she drew back , he noticed that her blue eyes , almost normal in color , were glistening . arms THE SPARROW 335 “
158874	158878	158872	158872	Supaari	504	” she said . “

He climbed down into the powerboat cockpit and looked up at the others of her kind , each one different , each a separate and peculiar puzzle . Suddenly , because Ha'an wished it , Supaari was moved to please the others , and so at last made a decision he 'd found troublesome . He looked around and found the Elder . “
158981	158985	158971	158971	Someone	4267	” he told D.W. “
159005	159006	158995	158995	someone	4267	" “
159013	159048	158995	158995	someone	4267	” Anne announced gaily , shaking off the sadness of Supaari 's departure as his powerboat disappeared around the north bend of the river and the Runa began moving back up to their apartments , “
159064	159065	158995	158995	someone	4267	” “
159069	159081	158995	158995	someone	4267	” said Emilio , straight - faced , and Marc laughed . “
159090	159116	158995	158995	someone	4267	” Jimmy suggested helpfully . Sofia smiled and shook her head , and Jimmy 's heart rose but then went obediently back where it belonged . “
159123	159136	158995	158995	someone	4267	” George asked , shushing Askama and turning to look at Anne . “
159150	159168	158995	158995	someone	4267	” D.W. demanded . Anne grinned like the Cheshire cat as they started up the cliffside together . “
159181	159227	159176	159176	Supaari	504	” The path narrowed at that point and they strung out into a line , Askama chattering to George about some long , elaborate story they 'd been making up together until she saw Kinsa and Fayer , and the children took off to play . “
159251	159285	159286	159286	Jimmy	309	” Anne told them when they arrived at the apartment . It was filled with Runa , but endless cross talk was normal to them now and she hardly noticed the other conversations . “

159363	159373	159354	159354	dear	4138	” George said suspiciously , sinking onto a cushion . “
159382	159383	159376	159376	they	3490	” “
159440	159451	159452	159452	I	0	” Anne said when they stared at her in shock . “

159739	159774	159737	159737	dear	4138	” Anne said . Chaypas and her guests decided to go to Aycha 's to eat and suddenly the apartment emptied out . When they were alone , Anne leaned forward and continued conspiratorially . “
159801	159808	159784	159784	I	0	” she added when George pouted . “
159823	159837	159812	159812	they	3513	” George asked petulantly , his manhood under oblique attack from two quarters . “
159862	159866	159850	159850	they	3513	” Anne said . “
159952	159980	159942	159942	they	3513	” Emilio had become increasingly thoughtful and D.W. , watching him , began to chuckle . Emilio did n't laugh at first , but he came around . “
159983	159987	159942	159942	they	3513	” Anne asked . “

160061	160102	160036	160037	social father	3525	” D.W. agreed . Emilio laughed ruefully and ran his hands through his hair . Everyone was looking at him now , curiosity plain on their faces . He hesitated , probing old wounds , and found them scabbed over . “
160116	160126	160106	160114	a woman of great warmth and a lively nature	3529	” he told them , choosing his words carefully . “
160154	160175	160147	160148	My mother	1578	” He paused to let them absorb this ; it did n't take a geneticist to work out the implications . “

160226	160238	160239	160239	They	3537	” Emilio sat still then , and the room was quiet . “
160253	160273	160244	160244	He	3534	” This had never occurred to him before and he had no idea how he should feel about it . “
160288	160289	160284	160284	Anne	332	” “
160298	160323	160291	160291	you	3534	” Anne said astutely , hating the woman for letting it happen and silently berating God for giving this son to the wrong mother . “
160336	160388	160291	160291	you	3534	” Emilio looked briefly at Anne , but his eyes slid away . A mistake , he realized , to speak of this . He had tried so hard to understand , but how could a child have known ? He shrugged again and steered the talk away from Elena Sandoz . “
160422	160445	160414	160414	I	0	” He sat up and threw the hair out of his eyes with a jerk of 338 MARY DORIA RUSSELL his head . “
160458	160525	160446	160446	I	0	” he told them , savoring it , even after all the years . D.W. , who knew what was coming , grinned in spite of himself . He 'd deplored the random violence of La Perla and worked hard to find ways for kids like Emilio to settle things without knifing somebody . It was an uphill battle in a place where fathers told sons , “
160535	160555	160556	160556	Our	3544	” And this was advice given to eight - year - olds on the first day of third grade . “
160561	160572	160558	160559	Father Superior	651	” he heard Emilio tell the others with vast enjoyment , “
160646	160647	160629	160631	the larger man	3550	” “
160661	160748	160629	160631	the larger man	3550	” D.W. finished , in tones that suggested the sagacity of this was self - evident . He had , in fact , taught the kid a few little things in the gym . Emilio being small , surprise was necessarily a prerequisite to some maneuvers . The subtlety came in making the boy understand it was okay to fight in self - defense when Miguel came home mean - drunk , but it was not necessary to take on a whole neighborhood of taunting kids . "
160763	160775	160650	160651	the sumbitch	3552	” Emilio was telling them with serene respect for his mentor , "
160787	160788	160789	160789	I	0	” “
160804	160808	160799	160799	you	3543	” Jimmy said . “
160814	160917	160918	160918	You	3554	” The conversation drifted off into stories of a priest Jimmy had known in South Boston who 'd boxed in the Olympics and then D.W. started in on a few sergeants he 'd known in the Marines . Anne and Sofia started lunch and listened , heads shaking , to tales of certain illegal but remarkably effective hockey moves available to alert goalies in the Quebec league . But the talk came back to the Jana'ata Handshake , as Supaari 's attack on Sandoz was known among them , and when it veered toward Emilio 's childhood once more , he stood . “
160930	160957	160918	160918	You	3554	” he said with a certain edgy finality , moving toward the terrace . But then he THE SPARROW 339 stopped and laughed and added piously , “
160965	161296	160958	160959	The Lord	3555	" And it was impossible to tell whether he was serious or joking . THE CRUISE DOWNRIVER from Kashan seemed to Supaari to go more quickly than the trip out from Gayjur . The first day , he simply let his mind go blank , his attention absorbed by the eddies and driftwood , the sandbars and rocks . But the second day on the river was a thoughtful one , full of wonder . He had been deluged by new facts , new ideas , new possibilities , but he had always been quick to grasp opportunities and willing to take friendships where he found them . The foreigners , like the Runa , were sometimes startlingly different from his people and often incomprehensible , but he liked Ha'an very much — found her mind lively and full of challenge . The rest of them were less clear to him , only adjuncts to the sessions with Ha'an , translating , illustrating , providing food and drink at bizarre and irritating intervals . And to be honest , they nearly all smelled alike . He would buy the rented powerboat outright when he got back , Supaari decided , watching a good - sized river kivnest breach and roll nearby . The purchase price had been rendered trivial ; he had examined the foreign goods , knew now the dimensions of the trade he could broker . Wealth beyond counting was guaranteed . This trip alone had yielded a fortune in exotica . He had explained his business to the for eigners and they were happy to provide him with many small packets of aromatics , their names as marvelous as their scents . Clove , vanilla , yeast , sage , thyme , cumin , incense . Sticks of brown cinnamon , white cylinders called beeswax candles which could be set afire to give off a fragrant light that Supaari found enchanting . And they 'd given him several “
161298	162862	160918	160918	You	3554	” that one foreigner made on paper . Beautiful things ; remarkable , truly . Supaari almost hoped the Reshtar would turn them down ; Supaari rather liked these landscapes himself . It was obvious that the foreigners had no understanding of the value of their goods , but Supaari VaGayjur was an honorable man and offered the interpreter a fair price , which was one in twelve of what he 'd get from Kitheri and , at that , a substantial amount . A great deal of embarrassing confusion ensued . Ha'an had tried to insist the goods were 340 MARY DORIA RUSSELL as nev gifts : a disastrous notion that would have prevented resale . The small , dark interpreter and his sister with the mane sorted that out but thenwhat was his name ? Suhn ? Suhndos ? He 'd tried to hand the packets directly to Supaari ! What kind of parents did these people have ? If Askama had n't guided her counterpart 's hands to Chaypas 's for the transfer , the VaKashani would have been cut out of the deal entirely . Shocking manners , although the interpreter had abased himself prettily enough when he recognized the mistake . Because the VaKashani were hosts to the foreign delegation and thus entitled to a percentage of Supaari 's profit , the village would move nearly a year ahead of schedule closer to breeding rights . Supaari was pleased for them , and slightly envious . If life were as simple and straightforward for a Jana'ata third as for a Runa corporation , his own problem would have been solved . He could simply buy breeding rights and get on with it , having proven his fiscal responsibility and obedience to the government . But Jana'ata life was never simple and rarely straightforward . Deep in the Jana'ata soul there was an almost unshakable conviction that things must be controlled , thought out , done correctly , that there was very little margin for error in life . Tradition was safety ; change was danger . Even Supaari felt this , although he defied the instinct often and to his profit . The storytellers claimed that the first five Jana'ata hunters and the first five Runa herds were created by Ingwy on an island , where balance could be easily lost and annihilation was the price of poor stewardship . Five times the hunters and their mates erred : leaving things to chance , killing without thought , letting their own numbers grow uncontrolled , and all was lost . On the sixth attempt , Tikat Father of Us All learned to breed the Runa and Sa'arhi Our Mother was made his consort and they were brought to the mainland and given dominion . There were other stories about Pa’au and Tiha’ai and the first brothers , and on and on . Who knew ? Maybe there was some truth in it all , but Supaari was a skeptic . The Ingwy Cycle was too pat an explanation for duogeniture , too convenient for the firsts and seconds justifying their grip on the world . It did n't matter . Whether the legends grew from ancient seeds of truth or sprang fully formed from the self - interest of the rulers , Supaari thought , things are as they are . He was a third ; how , then , to convince the Reshtar of Galatna that Supaari VaGayjur was worthy of being created Founder ? It was a delicate business and required subtlety and cunTHE SPARROW 341 ning , for reshtari were rarely generous in granting to others the very prerogative denied themselves . Somehow , Hlavin Kitheri must come to believe it was in his interest to bestow this privilege . A pretty puzzle for Supaari VaGayjur . He let the problem go , for pursuit can drive the quarry away . Better to stroll along , alert for opportunity , wasting no effort on mad dashes and undignified chases . If one is patient , he knew , something always comes within reach . 09 AFTER SUPAARI 'S FIRST visit , the Jesuit party settled into a routine that made their second full year on Rakhat as productive and satisfying as they could have hoped for . They were given their own apartments , two of them , thanks to Supaari , who had arranged it when Anne admitted that they found it wearying to be with the Runa all the time . She also told him , privately , that D.W. was not well and sometimes found the distance to the river difficult . Supaari had no guess as to the cause or cure for the Elder 's illness but thoughtfully specified living space further down the cliffside than Manuzhai 's home . Sofia lived with Anne and George . The apartment next door became a dormitory for the unmarried men and an office for everyone . Anne 's side was home . This orderly division of use was , they found , a great improvement over the endless ad hoc arrangements made day by day when they were living with Manuzhai and Chaypas . They now knew from Supaari that they were not just tolerated by the VaKashani but welcome . They had fit into the economic structure of the community by providing Supaari with goods that benefited the village and , in their own minds , this allowed them to be more assertive about requesting small accommodations , like limits to overnight visits and periods of privacy during the day . They still did a lot of visiting and often had guests who stayed overnight , especially Manuzhai and the ubiquitous Askama , but there was now some privacy on a regular basis . The relief was startling . That year Anne , Sofia and D.W. devoted most of their time to writing up the interviews with Supaari , with an emphasis on Runa biology , social structure and economy , and on Runa - Jana'ata cooperation . Every paragraph written generated a hundred new questions , but they took it one step at a time and a stream of papers went back to Rome , week af- 342 MARY DORIA RUSSELL ter week , month after month . In recognition of the partnership she felt with Supaari , Anne suggested listing him as the second author on all their papers . Sofia , instructed by Emilio 's generosity in this , did so immediately . Eventually D.W. took up the practice as well . Emilio Sandoz , a contented spider in the center of an intellectual web , collected lexemes , semantic fields , prosody and idiom , semantics and deep structure . He answered questions , translated and aided research for all of them , while collaborating with Sofia on an instructional program for Ruanja and with Askama and Manuzhai on a Ruanja dictionary . Marc had begun sketching and painting the Runa and their lives within days of arriving , and this continued as the seasonal round was played out . To Emilio 's delight , the Runa referred to Marc 's images using the spatial declension . And now when the women left on trading expeditions , they commissioned a portrait from Marc or his apprentices , so they could be with their families even as they traveled , Chaypas explained . Absent mothers were gone but not invisible . George and Jimmy installed improvised plumbing and a pulley system for hauling things up and down the cliffside . The Runa soon added similar arrangements to the other apartments . And then there was George 's ever - elaborating waterslide complex down by the river 's edge , which the kids adored and which they all , native and alien , worked on sporadically . The Runa took everything in stride . Nothing ever seemed to surprise them , and it had begun to seem that they were incapable of astonishment . But toward the end of Supaari 's first visit , Marc had asked if the merchant knew of any objection to the foreigners starting a garden . Ruanja , Emilio found , had no word for plants grown in an artificial ecosystem , so Supaari was shown images of gardens . Familiar with the notion , Supaari brought the subject up with the Kashan elders and obtained permission for Marc to plant . And so , for no good reason that the VaKashani could conceive , Marc Robichaux and George Edwards and Jimmy Quinn set about digging in ground where no useful roots grew . They used giant spoons to lift up big bites of dirt and then simply put the dirt back where it had been , but upside down . The Runa were absolutely flabbergasted . That this mysterious activity was hard physical labor for the foreigners made the whole business funnier . George would pause to wipe his brow , and the Runa would quake with laughter . Marc would sit a while to catch his breath , and the Runa would gasp with merriment . THE SPARROW 343 Jimmy worked doggedly on , beads of sweat sparkling on the ends of his coiling red hair , and Runa observers would comment helpfully , “
162876	163052	160918	160918	You	3554	” and wheeze in a transport of amusement . The Runa were capable of sarcasm . Soon , Runa from other villages came to watch the gardeners while their children played on the waterslide , and George began to feel a retroactive sympathy for the Amish farmers of Ohio , unwilling tourist attractions subjected to stares and pointing fingers . But the initial hilarity tapered off as the garden took shape and the Runa began to perceive the geometric plan underlying the foreigners ' inexplicable work . The garden was a serious scientific experiment and careful records of germination and yield would be kept , but everything Marc Robichaux did was beautiful and he laid the garden out as a succession of interlocking diamond - shaped and circular beds , edged in herbs . George and Jimmy constructed trellises and adapted the Runa terrace parasols to shade the lettuces and peas and to control the downpours of rain . Manuzhai , intrigued now , joined them in this , and the resulting structures were lovely The "
163054	163171	163172	163172	We	3556	” season on Rakhat turned out to be reasonably well suited to the husbandry of Earth plants . As the season progressed , it could be seen that the rows and hills of vegetables were thoughtfully planned . Scarlet - stalked Swiss chard rose over beds of emerald spinach . Zucchini and corn and potatoes , tomatoes and cabbages and radishes , cucumbers and feathery carrots , red beets and purple turnips — all were incorporated into overflowing parterres , interplanted with edible flowers : pansies and sunflowers , calendula and Empress of India nasturtiums . It was glorious . Supaari came back to Kashan periodically and dutifully admired the flourishing potager on his third visit . “
163186	163203	160918	160918	You	3554	” he said tactfully , for he was greatly offended by some of the foreign odors , “
163213	163397	163398	163398	He	3558	” He took no interest in it thereafter , considering it a harmless eccentricity . Supaari , they noticed , brought his own food from the city with him and ate in privacy , in the cabin of his powerboat . Sometimes he also brought Runa with him from the city , memory specialists who were apparently like living textbooks , who could answer some of the more technical questions the foreigners asked . And there were written materials as well , in the K’San language and therefore completely incomprehensible except for the engineering drawings . George and Jimmy were particu- 344 MARY DORIA RUSSELL larly interested in radio , and they wanted to know about power generation , signal production , receiving equipment and so forth . Supaari found this understandable , since he knew in a somewhat foggy way that the foreigners had come to Rakhat because they 'd overheard the Galatna concerts somehow , but he was unable to give them much information . He knew of radio only as a listener . This ignorance was frustrating to the technophiles . “
163407	163415	163398	163398	He	3558	” Anne said in Supaari 's defense . “
163437	163466	163433	163435	Leonardo da Vinci	660	” And she invited a disgruntled George to tell Supaari how aspirin works . Supaari was , at least , able to explain why the Runa disliked music . “
163475	163513	163467	163467	We	3562	” he told Anne and Emilio , as they sat outside in a hampiy equipped with cushions , unconcerned about the light drizzle falling . He seemed to have trouble finding the correct Ruanja phrasing for this . “
163529	163530	163523	163524	The Runa	501	" “
163540	163544	163545	163545	Someone	4267	” Anne asked . “
163576	163590	163591	163591	They	3564	” He motioned to indicate that these groups would stand opposite each other . “
163620	163621	163612	163613	The Runa	501	” “
163625	163631	163612	163613	The Runa	501	" Anne exclaimed in English . “
163665	163666	163652	163652	They	501	” “
163697	163703	163704	163704	Someone	4267	” Emilio switched to Ruanja . “
163724	163739	163704	163704	Someone	4267	” he ventured and explained his logic to Supaari , to test the model . “
163744	163772	163704	163704	Someone	4267	” the Jana'ata said , thinking Emilio was merely translating . He leaned back onto an elbow comfortably and added with a tone that Anne found wry , “
163781	163810	163774	163774	Jana'ata	506	” But Supaari brought no other Jana'ata with him and stalled when George and Jimmy repeated their request to see the city and meet others of his people . “
163816	164109	163811	163811	Jana'ata	506	” he told them when pressed for a reason . It was unusual , he let them understand , that he had learned Ruanja ; ordinarily , it was the Runa who were required to learn Jana'ata THE SPARROW 345 languages . It was a lame enough excuse that they accepted it as a polite fiction , and D.W. reckoned ole Supaari was probably keeping their existence secret to preserve his monopoly on the trade . The Jesuit party was familiar with capitalism and did n't begrudge the merchant his corner on the coffee and spice market . So while Yarbrough was getting anxious to make contact with someone in authority , they tried to be patient . Cunctando regitur mundis , after all . In the meantime , Emilio stepped up his work on K’San . At last there came a day , a Rakhati year and a half after their arrival in Kashan , when Supaari told them that he had worked out a way for them to visit Gayjur . It would take some time ; there were many arrangements , and the visit would have to wait until after the next rainy season . He would not be able to come upriver to visit them during that time but he would return at the beginning of Partan and take them to the city . His plan hinged somehow on their ability to see in redlight , but he was indirect about why this should be so . In any case , they were reasonably content with the situation as it stood . They were all productively employed . Supaari had been wonderfully helpful in many ways , and they did not want to impose on his good nature . “
164114	164124	163811	163811	Jana'ata	506	” Emilio would say , and Marc would add , “
164132	164583	163811	163811	Jana'ata	506	” During this time , the health of the Jesuit party remained good , on the whole . They were free of viral illness since there was no disease reservoir here that could affect them . Jimmy broke a finger . Marc was badly bitten by something he 'd found while poking around and lifting up rocks ; it got away , so they were never sure what the culprit was , but Robichaux recovered . George confirmed Manuzhai 's fears by falling off a walkway one night , but he was n't seriously hurt . There was the usual run of cuts , bruises , blisters and muscle pulls . For a while Sofia had a lot of headaches , trying to cut back on coffee because the VaKashani now swayed with dismay whenever the foreigners actually drank the stuff instead of selling it . After a month of doling out analgesics , Anne suggested that Sofia should just do her drinking in private . Sofia adopted this solution with relief . In general , it was a tidy little practice for Anne Edwards , M.D. , flawed only by despair for one of her patients . His spirit and mind remained strong , but D. W. Yarbrough 's body was failing him and there was , as far as she could determine , nothing in this world Anne could do about it . X ICCO 346 MARY DORIA RUSSELL IT WAS PREDICTABLE , when they thought about it later , that the Runa would begin to garden . Once the Runa understood what all the ludicrous labor had produced , once they had seen how beautiful a garden could be , once they knew that food could be grown close to home , they seized upon gardening with typical enthusiasm and creativity . From Kashan , the practice moved along river courses to other villages and along the coast toward Gayjur . Anne , questioning Runa visitors and using satellite data , tracked the spread , said it was a textbook case of diffusion and wrote it up . Marc and George accompanied the first Runa gardeners on expeditions to pik and k’jip fields and helped them bring back transplants . Seeds were collected , slips taken and rooted . Some crops failed but others flourished . New plants were added . The foreigners were glad to provide potatoes , which the Runa loved , and to share beets and even popcorn , which was an enormous hit , both as entertainment and as food . When Sofia wondered if this sharing of seeds and transplants from Earth might trigger some sort of ecological disaster , Marc said , “
164617	164737	164598	164598	they	3571	” Freed from the endless marching from home to naturally growing food sources , their diet supplemented by garden produce , the VaKashani and their neighbors grew visibly opulent . Fat levels rose . Hormone pro duction kicked in at concentrations that brought on estrus , and life got a good deal more interesting in Kashan and the surrounding villages Even if Supaari had not tipped Anne off to the general outlines of Runa sexuality , she 'd have worked it out by observation alone that year : there was no real privacy in Runa life . And the Runa , she discovered , were in fact quite curious about where little foreigners came from , so to speak . “
164739	165049	165050	165050	Sofia	330	” was not the answer they were interested in . So , with sex and pregnancies and new households suddenly of universal interest , Anne explained certain aspects of human behavior , physiology and anatomy . This soon led to a new accuracy in the way Ruanja personal pronouns were applied to the foreigners . And though single - irised eyes were affectionately averted and human commentary was thoughtfully circumspect in the sexually charged atmosphere of Kashan , there was no way for the courtship of Jimmy THE SPARROW 347 Quinn and Sofia Mendes to go unnoticed . The VaKashani were delighted by the couple . They showed this by being rowdy and lewd , making bawdy remarks that frequently went beyond the suggestive into the realm of the expository . Jimmy and Sofia took it all in the good - natured spirit with which it was given . Shyness was not a luxury they were vouchsafed . And to be honest , as friendship deepened and a love was at long last permitted to flourish , there was only one person around whom they felt shy . Nothing was ever spoken among the three of them ; to speak would solidify truths that had been kept , at some cost to them all , insubstantial . Emilio did not join in the ribaldry or joke with them the way he might have with another couple . But now and then , when they returned together from a walk or looked up and saw him across the room , they would know that his eyes had been on them and they found in the still face and quiet gaze a benediction . When at last it came , fully two months after Sofia was ready for it , Jimmy 's proposal was typically comic and her response typically decisive . “
165052	165056	165050	165050	Sofia	330	” he said , “
165078	165079	165050	165050	Sofia	330	” “
165082	165756	165050	165050	Sofia	330	” she said . And so on the fifth of Stan’ja , approximately November 26 , 2041 , in the village of Kashan , Southern Province of Inbrokar , on the lavender and blue and green planet of Rakhat , James Connor Quinn and Sofia Rachel Mendes were married under a chuppah , the traditional opensided canopy of Jewish weddings , decorated at its corners with streamers of yellow and amethyst , of green and aquamarine , of carnelian and lilac , scented with something like gardenia and something like lily . The bride wore a simple dress Anne made from a silken Runa fabric that Supaari provided . Manuzhai made the circlet of ribbons and flowers Sofia wore around her head , with streamers of many colors woven into the crown , falling to the ground all around her . D.W. , not much heavier now than Sofia and very frail , gave the bride away . George was the best man . Anne was supposed to be the matron of honor , but decided to cry instead . Askama was the flower girl , of course , and the VaKashani loved this element of the ritual , so close to their own aesthetic . Marc Robichaux officiated at the ecumenical ceremony , working some rather lovely Ruanja poetry into the Nuptial Mass. Anne knew that the husband would stomp on a glass at the end of a Jewish ceremony , but the closest she could come to that tradition was to suggest that Jimmy break a Runa perfume flask . Then D.W. said that in view of Sofia 's dedication 348 MARY DORIA RUSSELL to the stuff , a coffee mug would be appropriately symbolic , so they used a pottery cup instead . And Marc ended the service with the Shehecheyanu , the Hebrew prayer for first fruits and new beginnings . Sofia stared , wide - eyed , when she recognized the French - accented words and then saw Marc concentrating on the lips of his language coach . When she turned to Emilio Sandoz , standing a little distance away , he smiled , and thus she received his wedding present . There was a feast , with plenty of twigs and popcorn . And there were games and races , which had winners and losers but did not make anyone porai because there were no prizes . It was a good - hearted amalgam of Runa and human customs and cuisine . Afterward , Anne , who had done as much work on these arrangements as any Earthside mother of the bride , made it clear that Jimmy and Sofia were to be left strictly alone on their first night . Entering into the spirit of the thing , the VaKashani constructed a doorway for the apartment given to the new couple : a trellised screen of woven vines , decorated with flowers and ribbons . Escorted home , Jimmy and Sofia thanked everyone , laughing , for their very helpful instructions , and found themselves alone at last , the sounds of communal merriment receding and merging into somewhat more private celebrations as the third sun set . Truths had been told , long before this night . In the delicious days of waiting that they gave themselves , as wedding plans went on around them , they spent hours in the shadowy filtered light of a hampiy shelter paved with cushions . There were many things to share : family legends , funny stories , simple biographical details . One afternoon Jimmy had lain next to Sofia , marveling at her small perfection and his good fortune . He had never assumed that she was coming to him an innocent and so , tracing the pure line of her profile with his finger , he looked down at her , his deep - set smiling eyes filled with erotic speculation , and asked in low tones of intimacy that left no doubt about his meaning , “
165763	165771	165761	165761	Sofia	330	” She burst into tears and said , “
165777	165803	165761	165761	Sofia	330	” for it had never occurred to her that anyone might ask such a thing . Startled , Jimmy kissed away salty tears , saying , “
165815	165936	165761	165761	Sofia	330	” But , puzzled by the strength of the reaction , he knew there was something behind this and looked at her , searching for it . She had meant to keep this one region of her past behind its old defensive walls , but the last barrier between them came down . When he heard it all , Jimmy thought his heart would break for her but he only sat THE SPARROW 349 and held her , long arms and endless legs enfolding her like a nestling , and waited for her to quiet . Then he smiled into her eyes and asked , in the dry academic tones of an astronomer discussing a theoretical point with a colleague , “
165952	166156	165940	165940	you	3577	” And he devised for her a calculus of love , which approached infinity as a limit , and made her smile again . So there were no more walls to be scaled , no more fortresses to defend by the fifth of Stan'ja , a month that marks the start of summer on Rakhat , when the nights are very short and full of stars and racing clouds and moons . But that first night was long enough for him to lead her in a private wedding dance , seeking the rhythm of her heart . And the moonlight , filtered through flowers and vines and streamers of color and fragrance , was very good for finding the way together to moments worthy of a Rakhati poet 's song . Later that summer , as rain fell , such a moment shimmered and paused on the brink , and then began the ancient dance of numbers : two , four , eight , sixteen , thirty - two , and a new life took root and began to grow . And thus the generations past were joined to the unknowable future . 30 VILLAGE OF KASHAN AND CITY OF GAYJUR : YEAR THREE “
166179	166183	166188	166188	I	0	" Anne asked D.W. “
166203	166250	166188	166188	I	0	” D.W. took a sip of the meat broth Anne had brought him and then laid his head back against the hammock chair . His gaze traveling down the long meandering ridge of his nasal bones , he fixed her with a look of judicious consideration . “
166271	166467	166470	166470	your	3578	" She smiled , and it was gratifying that he could still make people smile . He kept the mug in his hands for a while , to warm them , but then began to worry that it would slip out of his fingers , so he set it aside on the little table that Sofia and Emilio had once used as a desk out in this hampiy . The shelter was his now , had become pretty close to a permanent residence for him , barring really bad weather . He liked to be out where he could see the southern mountains or look northeast to find the line where the plains merged into sky . Manuzhai or Jimmy carried him down to the apartment if the weather looked to get ugly and then carried him back up to the hampiy when things settled down ; he could n't THE SPARROW 351 climb the cliff anymore on his own . Emilio stayed with him nights , so he would n't be alone . D.W. had worried about being a pain in the ass for everyone but felt better about it when Sofia told him , “
166499	166500	166470	166470	your	3578	" “
166505	166514	166515	166515	Doctor	4685	” said Anne , breaking into his reverie . “
166519	166520	166515	166515	Doctor	4685	” “
166533	166586	166527	166527	You	3583	” he informed her indignantly , but he picked up the cup with both thin hands and forced himself to continue working on it until he 'd drunk it all . He made a face , which was a little redundant given how he looked when he was n't making a face . “
166592	166597	166598	166598	I	0	” he told her . “
166608	166818	166527	166527	You	3583	” Anne reached out and put a hand on his wrist for a brief squeeze . She had tried everything she could think of . Half - killed him with parasiticides . Put him on an all - Earth diet from the lander stores . Boiled the rainwater he drank after passing it through all the filters and chemical treatments . Stopped the chemical treatments , thinking maybe they made it worse . Two or three times she thought they 'd gotten the damned thing on the run , whatever the hell it was . He 'd start to put on some weight , get some color and energy back , and then he 'd slip again . He was the only one affected . So , of course , they both wondered if he 'd brought something with him , was carrying something from home . But all the crew members had been put through a fine - meshed medical sieve before they left , and D. W. Yarbrough had once been abundantly healthy , strong as a lean old racehorse . Maybe something had gone subtly wrong with his physiology : he was sequestering something that was usually excreted or some enzymatic process had gone to hell . “
166827	166834	166825	166825	Annie	332	” he 'd told her once . “
166847	166848	166825	166825	Annie	332	” “
166879	166888	166889	166889	People	4085	” He knew bluster when he heard it . “
166893	166899	166900	166900	You	332	” he 'd told her . “
166913	166946	166900	166900	You	332	” Anne had turned away , blinking rapidly , but snuffled in a breath vigorously and got ahold of herself . When she spoke again , her voice was firm and irate . “
166965	166987	166900	166900	You	332	” 352 MARY DORIA RUSSELL D.W. came back to the present with a start , wondering if he 'd dozed off . “
166991	167012	166900	166900	You	332	” he said , working his way forward in the hammock chair and then resting on its edge before standing . “
167025	167026	167017	167017	I	0	” “
167029	167047	167017	167017	I	0	” Anne slapped her hands on her knees and pushed herself up , shaking off the worry . “
167060	167258	167052	167052	I	0	” They moved slowly , not saying much , walking along the gorge edge toward the southern mountains , D.W. setting the pace . Anne kept a careful eye on him , knowing that they should n't go very far because D.W. would have to walk back . Ordinarily , she could count on having someone to carry him home if he wore himself out , but they were alone in Kashan for the first time since the lander disaster . The Runa were out harvesting a flower called anukar . George , Marc and Jimmy had gone off with Supaari to see the city of Gayjur , at last . So there was no one around to help but Sofia , pregnant and nauseated , and Emilio , who was asleep . He 'd been up most of the night with D.W. , who 'd had another bad time of it . To Anne 's surprise , and to his own , D.W. did all right . They got as far as their old place on the ledge , which had a comfortable flat spot and a good view of the ravine and the western sky . “
167276	167281	167266	167266	you	3587	” D.W. asked her . “
167303	167339	167295	167295	I	0	” She let him take hold of her arm and leaned back to steady his descent before sitting down next to him . They were quiet a while , as he got his breath back . “
167344	167362	167295	167295	I	0	” he started . Anne opened her mouth , but he shut her up with a look . “
167414	167460	167474	167475	a leader	3592	” He stopped and , out of habit , scuffed his hand around in the dirt , feeling for pebbles , but he 'd long since scoured the spot of rocks , so he gave up and let his hands go loose in his lap . “
167506	167507	167498	167498	'em	3594	” “
167531	167532	167524	167524	they	3595	” “
167615	167619	167620	167620	I	0	” He paused . “
167740	167774	167724	167724	I	0	” She started to protest but , hearing it , she remembered the hours after Alan 's death and the way Jimmy came through when they realized they were marooned . She nodded . “
167832	167867	167822	167822	He	309	” Yarbrough stopped . He lifted his arm and meant to put it around Anne 's shoulders but that was more than he could manage , so he just put his hand over hers . “
167915	167916	167912	167912	him	309	” “
167926	167951	167918	167918	Jimmy	309	” she said , trying to lighten the moment a little . But it was n't a light moment , so she told him , “
167969	168096	168097	168097	My	0	” D.W. smiled and she felt his hand tighten a little around hers , but he only looked at the sky , talked out . He meant to tell her about his grandmother , who 'd lived to be ninety - four and did n't recommend it . He meant to tell her to watch that Supaari character , there was something about him , and Anne should n't let herself get blinded by sentiment . He meant to tell her how really happy he 'd been , even these last months . He thought he had a few days left . But death has its own agenda and its own logic , and it caught them both unaware , with less warning than they expected . “
168100	168104	168097	168097	My	0	” GEORGE breathed . “
168109	168110	168111	168111	Jesus	344	” “
168117	168121	168111	168111	Jesus	344	” Jimmy whispered . “
168128	168160	168111	168111	Jesus	344	” 354 MARY DORIA RUSSELL Marc Robichaux pulled himself away from the panorama and looked toward Supaari VaGayjur , serenely piloting the little powerboat through the buoyed channels toward the city . “
168171	168845	168165	168165	We	3608	” he said quietly . The Jana'ata merchant 's chin lifted slightly in acknowledgment . He had planned their arrival thoughtfully , bringing them around the headland and into Radina Bay a little before second sundown . Ringed by three mountains , white stonework and red clay masonry gleaming in the lush pearlescent light , Gayjur embraced the crescent harbor in a long sweep from southeast to northwest ; the deepening darkness hid the tangle of ships and derricks and warehouses and shops nearest the docks and their eyes were drawn upward toward Galatna Palace , set like a jewel in the deep aquamarine vegetation of the central mountain . This was the best time of day to see the city — when the sky took on colors that always reminded Supaari of marble from Gardhan . It was also the safest time to bring the foreigners into port . Marc smiled at Jimmy and George , transfixed by the sight , and was glad for them . For almost six years of subjective time , these two men had dreamed of seeing the City of the Songs , which they now knew to be Gayjur . Whenever Supaari was in Kashan , they 'd hinted , bargained , very nearly demanded and almost begged him to take them there . They wanted to see a real city , they told him . They had trouble explaining why they were so anxious to go . They had no Ruanja words for much of what interested them , which was everything . They wanted to find out what the buildings looked like , see where the food came from , where the sewage went , how the universities and government and hospitals were run , what transportation was like , how electricity was generated and stored and used . They wanted to talk to chemists , physicists , astronomers , mathematicians . See how the principles of the wheel , the lever and the inclined plane played out on this planet . Everything . They wanted to know everything . Marc himself was less frantic to get out of Kashan , but he too yearned to see the architecture and the art , to hear the music and see the sights . Were there parks ? Museums ? Zoos ! And Supaari said there were gardens . Formal or unplanned , utilitarian or purely decorative ? Were there houses of worship ? Who went ? Were there religious specialists , priests or priestesses , monks , adepts ? Did they believe in magic , in God or gods , in fate , in destiny , in the reward of good , the punishment of THE SPARROW 355 evil ? How were the milestones of life marked ? With cadenced ceremony or brief informal acknowledgments ? And the food — was it better in the city ? What did people wear ? Were they polite or pushy , punctilious or casual ? What was crime ? What was punishment ? What was virtue and what was vice ? What was fun ? Everything . Marc too wanted to know everything . Finally , after stalling them for a full Rakhati year , Supaari VaGayjur had deemed the considerations to have been fully considered , the arrangements adequately arranged and the time , at long last , ripe for their visit to his adopted city . On the three - day trip downriver from Kashan , moving past slow trade barges and small skiffs , he answered as many of their questions as he could . They were interested in the sulfuraluminum batteries that powered his craft , the material from which the hull was made , the waterproof coatings , the navigation equipment . When he finally convinced them that he simply used the boat , he did not make it , they went on to questions about the city itself , and when at last he could stand no more and told them finally , “
168855	169102	168848	168848	You	3609	” they talked among themselves in H’inglish , never resting from their curiosity . They stopped overnight at two villages along the way , the first one just above the Pon delta and the second on the Masna'a Tafa'i coast about twelve hours out of Gayjur . As in Kashan , the foreigners were accepted by the Runa without fuss . Supaari simply introduced them as traders , from far away . He was counting on this kind of reception by VaGayjuri Runa as well and was heartened to see the reality of it in these outlying villages , after so much worried anticipation . He began to hope things would go well . But once again he made the foreigners promise that they would only go out at redlight , and even then accompanied always by his Runa secretary , Awijan . It was important that they not be seen by other Jana'ata . This restriction was in direct opposition to D. W. Yarbrough ’s desire to make contact with the Jana'ata government . It was past time , he believed . If the Jesuit party hung around much longer without making itself known , the authorities might think there was something sneaky about them , wonder why they 'd kept themselves a secret such a long time . But they owed Supaari a debt of gratitude for all his assistance and in the end , D.W. decided that they should abide by his rule . “
169113	169130	168848	168848	You	3609	” Yarbrough told Marc and George and Jimmy be- 356 MARY DORIA RUSSELL fore they left . “
169149	169304	168111	168111	Jesus	344	” He knew he would n't be a part of the discussion . He knew that he was dying . They all did . Now , faced with Gayjur itself , the three humans understood that it would be a real job just to get a superficial impression of the city in the six days allotted to this visit . Marc Robichaux began to feel that this was another of the step - by - step increments they were meant to take . Coming within line of sight to his compound , Supaari radioed Awijan , announcing their arrival , and steered the little powerboat through the towering mass of shipping . He docked with insouciant skill and a yawn and pointed out his compound 's gateway with casual pride , trusting its impressive size and the obvious signs of prosperity to tell his visitors that they were dealing with a man of consequence . “
169317	170614	168111	168111	Jesus	344	” he asked them , knowing full well what they would say . When they said it , he handed them over to his secretary and told them to trust Awijan to escort them properly and to answer their questions . He , Supaari , was going to sleep now and would see them the next day , in the morning at second sunrise . ISI AND SO , WITH as much preparation as they could have hoped for , Marc Robichaux , Jimmy Quinn and George Edwards plunged into an alien city for the first time . It was all very well to expect to be surprised and confused , but it was sheer bedlam to experience . The scents and noise of Gayjur assaulted them : warehouses filled with the sweet and spicy and grassy fragrances of perfume components ; docks and shipyards smelling of wet sail , rotting sea life , sealants and paint , sailors and loaders shouting ; cookshops and street stalls and factories turning the air fragrant and stinking by turns with soups and ammonia and frying vegetables and solvents . There was a vast amount of exchange going on , of buying and selling , of business being done in temporary but wellmade booths with handsome fittings leaning against beautifully built masonry walls . Vendors hawked unidentifiable objects from pushcarts , simply designed and nicely balanced . Moving through the cramped sidestreets , they caught glimpses through half - open doors of Runa working with their ears clamped shut amid a deafening clamor of hammers and chisels , drills and electric saws . The pace was much faster than in Kashan , and there was far more variety of physical type , Marc noticed . The dockworkers were stockier , THE SPARROW 357 sturdy and drop - eared ; there were others , robed as Supaari had been when they met him , but smallish and subtly different in the face , alert and fine - boned , with a direct and disturbing gaze , and Awijan was one of these . And there were differences in coat : the colors and textures varied , some rough and curling , others silkier and longer than normal in Kashan . Regional variations , Marc thought . Immigrant populations , perhaps , natural in a port city . It was a weird feeling , walking along in plain view , undeniably strange , and yet no crowds gathered , no children screamed or pointed or hid . They were noticed and commented upon quietly as they passed through the streets , but when Awijan offered to buy them kebablike sticks of roasted vegetables , the vendor simply handed them their food with ordinary courtesy . They might have been buying pretzels in Philadelphia . As night fell , Awijan led them back to Supaari 's compound and took them through an open courtyard , past many small storage buildings , along the edge of an impressive warehouse , and then into the living quarters , spare and plain - walled but hung with brilliant tapestries and cushioned with deep carpets . After years of sleeping in the huddled company of Runa , they were astonished to be given small private rooms and found the circular bedding on raised platforms nestlike and very fine to curl up in . They slept soundly until long past first sunrise . It was midday when Supaari met them for their first and his only meal . As they reclined against the pillows and cushions along the walls , a long low table was carried in and then paved with a stream of plates and bowls and platters emerging from the kitchen . There were roasted meats , soups , extraordinary things that appeared to be seafood stuffed with pastes of something savory and then formed somehow into loaves and sliced , and fruits they had not seen before and many kinds of vegetables , plain and with sauces and carved cunningly and left whole . There were strong flavors , and delicate and bland and spiced . The service was soft - footed and discreet , and the meal took hours . Awijan sat nibbling at a little distance and observed ; Marc noted the next day that the dishes that had pleased no one were gone from the array and those that the guests had most enjoyed were prominently offered again , surrounded by other choices not seen earlier . That second evening , Awijan took the foreigners farther uptown , and it was on this tour that they began to get a feel for the strangely hy- 358 MARY DORIA RUSSELL brid layout of the city . There was , they now realized , the skeleton of rational gridwork , a rectilinear system of main streets well paved with good heavy cobbles and a system of canals , dividing the city into segments that linked incoming freight from the countryside or ocean to processing and distribution centers in the city . The city was not crowded in the way that the teeming ports of Earth were . There were no beggars , no limbless cripples , no emaciated loners picking through garbage or potbellied children tugging at weary despairing parents . There was an increasingly noticeable contrast between the rich and the poor as they moved uphill and the congestion thinned and the buildings became more imposing , but it did not disturb the humans as they might have been disturbed in Rio or Calcutta or Lima or New York . Here , one had the impression that prosperity was attainable , that people were competent and confident and either on their way up or content to be where they were . The makeshift markets and bustle seemed due to a desire to get down to business without a lot of extraneous bother over display . And there was a kind of beauty in that . They saw no schools but many small shops and little factories and minifoundries in which apprentices absorbed skills by patient accretion . For all the movement and hustle in the streets , there were gates to small yards in which families could be seen at rest , eating under wide overhanging eaves , sheltered from the rain but outside in the evening air . There was an eerie quiet sometimes , when the sounds of soft - booted feet and musical Runa voices and the plashing patter of steady rain were all that could be heard as they passed through districts where the trade , like tailoring and embroidery , involved no metal . On their third evening , Awijan took them across the bay to the glassmakers ' quarter to see the manufacture of spectacular serving pieces like those that graced Supaari 's table ; clear , heavy , polished glass with streamers of sparkling bronze - colored aventurine ribboning through the bodies of the bowls . Marc had the impression that there were two main aesthetic traditions , one encrusted and heavy with decoration , the other rather spare and clean . Made for Jana'ata and Runa , respectively , he guessed , gazing across the bay to Galatna Palace and the surrounding hillside compounds , with their mosaics and fountains , their high walls crenellated and corbeled , their facades barnacled with ornament . More money than taste , Marc thought uncharitably . Galatna had THE SPARROW 359 SO vo an overevolved look , like that of classical Chinese architecture , as though it had been worked on too long , layered and added to more than was strictly good for it . He questioned Awijan about this as they toured the next shop . “
170623	170642	170643	170643	Someone	4267	” Awijan told him , indicating the highly decorated items , and added in a low confiding voice , “
170652	170966	170643	170643	Someone	4267	” Which confirmed Marc 's admiration for Runa chic . And yet on their final day in the city , Marc was forced to modify his dismissal of Jana'ata art . George and Jimmy had finally made it clear that the one thing they must do without fail was talk to a chemist about fuel for the lander . It took a fair bit of explaining , but Supaari finally caught on to what they were trying to say and Awijan dispatched a runner to a local distiller of perfumes who brought back a thin - faced and somewhat nervous - looking chemist . With graphics of the periodic table of elements to establish some common ground and 3 - D displays of fuel components to work from , the chemist was quick to catch on to the problem . To the belly - deep relief of the foreigners , the formula did not seem at all daunting . But Marc 's eyes glazed over during the technical discussion that followed and Supaari , equally bored , asked if perhaps Robichaux would like to see something of Jana'ata art . The suggestion was so casual that Marc , who was beginning to know Supaari , suspected immediately that Supaari had planned it in advance . A two - passenger chair was summoned , and Marc was given a hooded robe that was far too large and helped into the curtained conveyance . Supaari declared that he himself would accompany the Foreigner Marc on this excursion , leaving Awijan behind to assist George and Jimmy with the chemist . It was full daylight and Marc , peeking through the spaces between the curtains as they were carried uptown , caught glimpses of new areas of the city and got an entirely different impression of the place . Here , Jana'ata were everywhere and conspicuous , “
170970	170978	170982	170982	their	3615	” Supaari murmured , a little sarcastically , “
170992	171183	171184	171184	You	3616	” The faces were very like the Runa faces Marc was familiar with , but there was a hollow - cheeked and wolfish look to them that left him uneasy . Unlike Supaari , they seemed not lively but frighteningly intent , not friendly but coldly courteous , not humorous but keenly observant , and above all : unapproachable . Everywhere , ak 360 MARY DORIA RUSSELL son e a musen IICO Runa stepped back , bowed or nodded or turned aside . Marc shrank back into his enclosure , now feeling in his gut some of the reasons behind Supaari 's repeated warnings about other Jana'ata , and gave thanks to God that they 'd encountered the Runa first . The commotion of the city receded as they continued uphill and turned toward the mountain south of Gayjur . At length they arrived at a solitary stone building , low - lying and horizontal in plan , galleried and deeply eaved . Supaari told Marc to wait out of sight , and then disappeared for some time . When he returned Supaari leaned in through the curtains and whispered , “
171211	171238	171239	171239	Someone	4267	” Marc lifted his chin and understood very well . Jana'ata were capable of lying , he observed with some amusement . Supaari continued very quietly , “
171272	171441	171442	171442	You	3621	" When they were alone except for the Runa chaircarriers , Supaari assisted Marc out of the chair and led him , head down under his hood and dripping oversized Jana'ata draperies like a child playing dress - up , into the building and across a central open area with scented fountains . Holding up his robes , keeping his hands concealed under the long oversleeves , Marc found himself ascending a ramp to a secondlevel gallery . He was so intent on not tripping over his garment and keeping his alien anatomy under wraps that he hardly glanced at anything around him until they reached a small curtained room , like a box at the opera . Supaari stepped in first and found his position before drawing the front curtains close together . Then he motioned Marc in and closed off the back curtain , leaving the box in semidarkness , indicating with a gesture that it was safe for the foreigner to throw back his hood . “
171453	171457	171442	171442	You	3621	” Supaari whispered . “

173780	173806	173807	173807	Supaari	504	“ This was not an animal . Djanada are Jana’ata , do you understand ? But these are dishonorable men . The killer was VaHaptaa , ”
173815	173832	173807	173807	Supaari	504	“ Do you understand this word ? Haptaa ? In Ruanja , it is brai noa . ”
173855	173874	173875	173875	Sandoz	291	“ Brai noa . Without a home . VaHaptaa is ‘ from nowhere . ' Landless , perhaps . "

174020	174042	174009	174009	Sandoz	291	“ VaHaptaa take without permission . Khukurik is not permitted . You should kill that one if you see him again , ”
174047	174077	174043	174043	Supaari	504	“ Someone would thank you for this service . And the VaKashani will also be grateful . Va Haptaa are dangerous to them : djanada , do you understand ? "
174151	174163	174164	174164	he	504	“ Sipaj , Sandoz . Someone is sorry for your loss , ”
174216	174221	174222	174222	Sandoz	291	“ You are kind , ”
174227	174237	174222	174222	Sandoz	291	“ Someone will return before the end of Partan . ”
174238	174247	174248	174248	Supaari	504	“ Our hearts will be glad of it . "
174415	174429	174409	174409	she	330	“ You are this baby 's grandfather . You will live with us . ”
174460	174466	174467	174467	Sofia	330	“ I 'm all right , ”
174473	174493	174467	174467	Sofia	330	“ See about Emilio . It was bad , Jimmy . You ca n't imagine . It was terrible . ”
174533	174545	174546	174546	Jimmy	309	“ D.W. would tell you to write up the damn report , ”
174563	174580	174546	174546	Jimmy	309	“ It can probably wait until tomorrow , if you do n't feel up to it . ”
174666	174687	174688	174688	Marc	342	“ Thank you . I shall write the report tonight . It will be good to have something to do . ”
174769	174778	174764	174764	Marc	342	“ I shall be in Aycha 's apartment . ”
174814	174827	174808	174808	Emilio	291	“ It 's okay . I 'll see what I can do . ”
174942	174950	174951	174951	he	309	" ¿ Quieres compañeros o estar solo ? ”
174964	174968	174951	174951	he	309	“ Soy solo . ”
174988	174998	174999	174999	he	309	“ Mírame , ' mano . Look at me ! ”
175036	175081	175029	175029	Emilio	291	“ You are not alone , Emilio . Sofia loved them and I loved them , too . Do you hear me ? Maybe not for so long , maybe not so deeply , but truly and well . We loved them , too . ”
175131	175180	175181	175181	he	291	“ Oh , Jesus . You 're not alone , Emilio . I love you . Sofia loves you . And our kid 's gon na need an uncle , man . You 're not alone . You 've still got us , right ? Oh , Jesus , ”
175191	175203	175181	175181	he	291	“ That 's better . Thank God ! That 's better ... "
175250	175266	175267	175267	He	309	“ Come on . No one sleeps alone tonight . You 're coming with me . ”
175285	175304	175267	175267	He	309	“ Marc , you come on up to our place , too . No one sleeps alone tonight ! ”
175605	175616	175617	175617	Jimmy	309	“ And you , Sofia ? You look so tired , ”
175704	175719	175701	175701	he	309	“ Do you want to tell me about it tonight or wait until later ? ”
175764	175770	175748	175748	she	330	“ SANDOZ ? I'M SORRY . ”
175783	175788	175789	175789	she	330	“ I 'm sorry , ”
175817	175820	175813	175813	he	291	“ D.W. ? ”
175828	175866	175823	175823	her	330	“ It 's only that I heard something a while ago . I 'm probably being an alarmist , but Anne and D.W. have been gone a long time . I think we should go find them . ”
175931	175937	175928	175928	Sofia	330	“ I 'll wait outside . ”
175948	175956	175957	175957	she	330	“ I should have gone out myself , ”
175960	175969	175957	175957	she	330	“ I should n't have gotten you up . ”
176035	176048	176053	176053	Sandoz	291	“ No . It 's okay . You did the right thing . ”
176097	176104	176105	176105	he	291	“ It 's quiet out there , ”
176120	176124	176125	176125	He	291	“ Too quiet . ”
176146	176154	176155	176155	He	291	“ They usually walk off that way . ”
176162	176171	176155	176155	He	291	“ You stay here . I can manage . ”
176200	176203	176204	176204	Sofia	330	“ No , ”
176215	176229	176230	176230	He	291	“ I 'll only sit and worry . I may as well come . ”
176239	176251	176236	176236	she	330	“ It 's all right . I feel fine . Really . ”
176316	176327	176328	176328	he	291	“ Get inside , lock the door and stay there , ”
176449	176453	176454	176454	he	291	“ Stay here , ”
176624	176635	176616	176616	he	291	“ There are tarps and a shovel in the lander . ”
177206	177209	177210	177210	she	330	“ Emilio , ”
177214	177224	177210	177210	she	330	“ I am your sister and we are orphaned . ”
177380	177387	177388	177388	she	330	" It 's a Jewish law , ”
177392	177402	177388	177388	she	330	“ You have to eat . Life goes on . ”
177544	177553	177554	177554	she	330	“ I did not mean to be cruel , ”
177569	177582	177554	177554	she	330	“ I only wanted him to feel a part of life again . ”
177699	177702	177705	177705	him	291	“ God , ”
177711	177714	177705	177705	him	291	“ God . ”
177804	177810	177811	177811	Sandoz	291	“ The VaKashani were kind , ”
177815	177908	177811	177811	Sandoz	291	“ When they returned and found out what had happened , they made certain no one was left alone . It was , I believe , in part a desire to comfort us but I think they were concerned that the VaHaptaa hunter who had taken Anne and D.W. was still in the region , looking for more easy prey . They were afraid for their children , naturally , but also for us because we obviously did not know how to take care of ourselves . And we had attracted trouble . ”
178004	178007	178008	178008	she	502	“ Meelo , ”
178019	178035	178008	178008	she	502	“ can you not be glad again ? I am very worried you might die . ”
178065	178080	178081	178081	John	298	“ Father Robichaux reported that there were a lot of babies at that time , ”
178116	178144	178113	178113	he	563	“ what a joy a new child can be , what a simple pleasure it is to have a baby 's damp head on one 's shoulder . ”
178226	178236	178237	178237	He	291	“ Yes . There were a lot of babies . ”
178248	178254	178245	178246	Johannes Voelker	301	“ It was the gardens . ”
178276	178286	178273	178273	his	301	“ I 'm sorry . I do n't follow . ”
178287	178302	178303	178303	Voelker	301	“ The mistake . What you 've been waiting for . The fatal error . ”
178323	178331	178332	178332	Sandoz	291	“ I deserved that , I suppose . ”
178335	178340	178341	178341	Voelker	301	“ I deserved that , ”
178347	178356	178357	178357	Emilio	291	“ We had all the information , really , ”
178360	178390	178357	178357	Emilio	291	“ It was all there . We just did n't understand . I think perhaps that even if we had been told directly , we would not have understood . ”
178649	178659	178660	178660	Sandoz	291	“ They breed to their feed , you see , ”
178665	178740	178741	178741	He	291	“ I realized this later , and Supaari confirmed it . The system is balanced so that the Runa are ordinarily untroubled by sexual desire . They have a family life , but they do n't breed unless the Jana'ata want them to . Normally , their fat levels stay low . They travel out to naturally growing resources . It costs energy to do this , yes ? The gardens upset the balance . ”
178754	178835	178741	178741	He	291	“ It 's difficult to take it in , is n't it . You see , the Jana'ata do n't keep Runa in stockyards or enslave them . The Runa work within the Jana'ata culture because they want to . They are bred to it , and it is normal for them . When a village corporate account reaches a certain level , they are provided with extra food , extra calories , and this brings the females into estrus . ”
178848	178852	178853	178853	he	294	“ Passive voice , ”
178856	178883	178853	178853	he	294	“ I wondered about it when I read it . Dr. Edwards said their mates were chosen using criteria other than those used for choosing spouses . ”
178884	178924	178925	178925	He	294	“ Yes . Subtle , is n't it . Their mates were chosen for them : by Jana'ata geneticists . The Runa select anyone they like to marry but they are bred according to the standards of the Jana'ata . ”
178936	178960	178925	178925	He	294	“ It is , when you think about it , quite a humane system , compared to the way we breed meat animals . ”
178967	178973	178961	178962	Felipe Reyes	379	“ Oh , my God . ”
178974	178986	178987	178987	Sandoz	291	“ Yes . You see it now , do n't you ? ”
179004	179010	179011	179011	Sandoz	291	“ You see it now , ”
179018	179074	179011	179011	Sandoz	291	“ The standards in the city , for specialists , are very high . But nothing is wasted . If the result of a mating is not up to standard , the offspring is removed as soon as possible , before an attachment can be formed . A sort of veal , one might say . "
179085	179208	179080	179080	he	301	“ The village Runa THE SPARROW 377 are in some ways the most fortunate . They gather food and fibers and other plant products , very much as they might have without Jana'ata interference in their lives . Their breeding is strictly controlled , but they are not preyed on as they were in prehistory , except for the occasional VaHaptaa poacher , who still exploits the Runa in the old way , as free - range food . Supaari told us that . When was it ? About two days after Anne and D.W. were killed . I myself used the word , poacher . I simply did n't realize that it implied the existence of legal use of the meat . ”
179209	179220	179221	179221	John	298	“ It would n't have made any difference , Emilio , ”
179232	179289	179290	179290	He	3822	“ No . It would n't have . I understand that , John . It was already too late . The gardens had been planted . The babies had been conceived . Everywhere . All over Inbrokar . Even if I had understood the day Supaari told us , it would n't have made any difference . ”
179299	179326	179327	179327	He	3822	“ We asked permission . We considered the ecological impact . We simply wanted to feed ourselves , not to be a burden on the village . ”
179337	179382	179327	179327	He	3822	“ And we wanted something familiar to eat . No one saw any harm in it . Not even Supaari . But he was a carnivore ! He thought the garden was ornamental . It never occurred to him that we would grow food . ”
179392	179398	179389	179389	his	754	“ Tell us what happened . ”
179508	179531	179532	179532	Sandoz	291	“ We had no idea what was going to happen . We just went up to the plain because everyone else did , ”
179535	179658	179532	179532	Sandoz	291	“ Marc was the only one of us who 'd seen any Jana'ata besides Supaari , and he was very uneasy about this patrol . The VaKashani asked us to stay in the center and keep quiet , and Marc thought this was correct . He was very agitated , yes ? He told me he 'd seen something in the city but he could n't be sure he 'd understood it . Manuzhai told us to be quiet , so I never found out what he 378 MARY DORIA RUSSELL meant . All I knew was that Marc was frightened , but the Runa seemed to be taking the situation fairly calmly . Then the patrol began to kill the babies . ”
179706	179714	179715	179715	he	291	“ There is a phrase in Hebrew , ”
179720	179739	179715	179715	he	291	“ Eshet chayil : woman of valor . Sofia realized what was happening before the rest of us . ”
179740	179745	179746	179746	Giuliani	294	“ And she resisted , ”
179761	179806	179746	179746	Giuliani	294	“ Yes . I heard her say it first , but then it was picked up by the VaKashani and became a sort of chant : ' We are many . They are few . ' She said this and then she walked forward . ”
179824	179881	179882	179882	He	291	“ She lifted one of the babies from the ground . I think the Jana'ata commander was so astonished by her existence that he simply could n't move at first . But then the whole village surged forward to retrieve the children , and when the Runa moved , the patrol began to react very quickly . ”
179896	179902	179903	179903	he	291	“ It was a bloodbath , ”
179911	179920	179907	179907	Voelker	301	“ Perhaps you would like to stop now ? ”
179921	179932	179933	179933	Emilio	291	“ No . No . I need to finish this . ”
179951	180072	179938	179938	he	291	“ The patrol , I think , was out of control for a time . I believe it was the combination of shock over our presence and outrage that the Runa had moved against them . And what Sofia said was terrifying to them , yes ? You must understand that the Jana'ata also strictly limit their numbers to those that can be sustained by this system of breeding . Their population structure is almost exactly that of a predator species in the wild , about four percent of the prey population . Supaari explained this to me . So to hear the Runa chanting , ' We are many . They are few'--this must have been nightmarish for them . ”
180073	180083	180084	180084	Felipe	379	“ I ca n't believe you 're defending them , ”
180140	180154	180115	180115	he	291	“ If you keep up this noise , I will have to quit . ”
180172	180209	180210	180210	He	291	“ I am not defending them . I am trying to explain to you what happened and why . But it is their society , and they pay their own price for their way of life . ”
180222	180238	180210	180210	He	291	“ What is the population of Earth now , Felipe ? Fourteen , fifteen billion ? ”
180239	180243	180244	180244	Felipe	379	“ Almost sixteen , ”
180248	180351	180244	180244	Felipe	379	“ There are no beggars on Rakhat . There is no unemployment . There is no overcrowding . No starvation . No environmental degradation . There is no genetic disease . The elderly do not suffer decline . Those with terminal illness do not linger . They pay a terrible price for this system , but we too pay , Felipe , and the coin we use is the suffering of children . How many kids starved to death this afternoon , while we sat here ? Just because their corpses are n't eaten does n't make our species any more moral ! ”
180373	180379	180368	180370	the Father General	754	“ Tell us what happened . ”
180399	180461	180393	180393	he	754	“ I believe the patrol meant only to kill the infants , originally . Supaari told me later that if the villagers bred a second time without permission , it would have been a capital offense for the females who 'd given birth . But because the Runa resisted , the patrol overreacted . They clearly meant to crush the riot . ”
180462	180468	180469	180469	Giuliani	294	“ How many were killed ? ”
180473	180489	180490	180490	He	754	“ I do n't know . Perhaps a third of the VaKashani . Maybe more . "
180494	180504	180490	180490	He	754	“ And Sofia . And Jimmy . And George . ”
180546	180552	180553	180553	Giuliani	294	“ And where were you ? ”
180556	180593	180553	180553	Giuliani	294	“ Toward the center of the crowd . Askama was very frightened . When the killing started , Manuzhai and I were trying to shield her with our bodies . Chaypas was killed , defending us . ”
180594	180599	180605	180605	Sandoz	291	“ And Father Robichaux ? ”
180600	180604	180605	180605	Sandoz	291	“ He ran . ”
180613	180660	180661	180661	He	291	“ I 'm not defending him either , but there was n't anything he could have done . We were the size of half - grown children and it was utter chaos . There was no chivalry . Anyone who came within reach was cut down . ”
180670	180696	180661	180661	He	291	“ We were completely un- 380 MARY DORIA RUSSELL prepared for this ! Supaari was so different . Try to imagine what it was like ! ”
180697	180711	180712	180712	Voelker	301	“ The Jana'ata military is the martial arm of a sentient predatory species , ”
180716	180733	180712	180712	Voelker	301	“ And they were defending civilization as they know it . It must have been terrifying . ”
180734	180737	180768	180770	the Father General	754	“ Yes . ”
180743	180753	180754	180754	Voelker	301	“ I 've got to have the lights out . ”
180775	180779	180768	180770	the Father General	754	“ Tell us . ”
180780	180787	180768	180770	the Father General	754	“ I was taken prisoner immediately . ”
180797	180900	180791	180791	Askama	502	“ Marc was hunted down without difficulty . We were taken with the Jana'ata patrol . From village to village . I do n't think they necessarily understood that we were responsible for the gardens . They did n't know what to make of us . They had a job to do , and they took us along . I believe they meant eventually to bring us to the city of Inbrokar , to the capital . In every village along the route , the gardens were burned and there was a slaughter of innocents . I 've got to finish this . ”
180911	180929	180901	180901	He	3841	“ Marc — you understand that the gardens were Marc 's , yes ? To witness this slaughter- ”
180935	180983	180901	180901	He	3841	“ The Jana’ata eat only once a day . We were offered food each morning and then force - marched for many hours . Marc refused to eat . I tried to persuade him , but he would only say something in French . A few words . ”
180999	181007	181008	181008	he	3841	“ I am illiterate in many languages , ”
181012	181053	181008	181008	he	3841	“ I have learned to speak Arabic and Amharic and K’San , but not to read them . French is the only language I read but do not speak . It is very different in its spoken form , yes ? ”
181066	181098	181060	181060	He	3841	“ When I tried to make Marc eat , he would say , ' Ill son , less and sawn . ' Something like that . I should have recognized it ... "
181099	181105	181108	181108	Giuliani	294	“ Ils sont les innocents . ”
181112	181131	181108	181108	Giuliani	294	“ It is hard to think the unthinkable . They were offering you the meat of the innocents . ”
181138	181152	181153	181153	He	3841	" Yes . Later , I myself saw whatNothing was wasted . Ed ? ”
181202	181209	181199	181199	he	3841	“ I dream of it sometimes . "
181230	181235	181236	181236	he	3841	" I am sorry , ”
181253	181272	181273	181273	Giuliani	294	“ You told us that you believed you were being brought by the military to the capital city , ”
181276	181285	181286	181286	He	294	“ I take it you did not reach — ”
181291	181294	181286	181286	He	294	“ Inbrokar . ”
181295	181395	181273	181273	Giuliani	294	“ No . Supaari told me later that he arrived at Kashan about two days after the massacre . He attended to matters there and then came after Marc and me . He had to guess at the route , I suppose . I think we were on the march for perhaps two weeks before he caught up with us . This period of time was very confused . And we were not functioning well . I tried to get Marc to eat . I- He was not able to do this . After a while I gave up . ”
181396	181403	181404	181404	John	298	“ But you ate the meat , ”
181407	181412	181404	181404	John	298	“ After you knew . ”
181413	181416	181417	181417	Emilio	291	“ Yes . ”
181427	181522	181523	181523	He	291	“ There was a time in the British military when it was possible to punish a man with as many as eight hundred lashes . Have you read of such things ? Some men actually survived this , and they reported that after a time , they no longer felt any pain . They felt only a sort of hammering . It was like that , in my soul . Do you understand ? To watch the children killed , to eat the meat . After a time , it felt only like hammering . ”
181539	181577	181533	181533	they	3846	“ Anyway , Supaari caught up to the patrol . By the time he found us , Marc was very weak . I think the commander would have killed him soon . He was slowing them up . ”
181636	181660	181617	181617	he	291	“ I think Supaari bribed the commander . There was a long discussion . It was in a language I did n't know . ”
181661	181670	181671	181671	John	298	“ So Supaari took you back to Kashan ? ”
181686	181718	181684	181684	himself	291	“ No . I do n't know that we 'd have been welcome there . He took us to Gayjur . To his own compound . I never saw Kashan again . "
181719	181750	181751	181753	the Father General	754	“ Based on Father Robichaux 's descriptions of his time in that city , you would have been relatively safe there , as long as you kept out of sight , ”
181756	181763	181751	181753	the Father General	754	“ Or perhaps I am wrong ? ”
181764	181850	181851	181852	Vincenzo Giuliani	294	“ I believe Supaari originally meant it to be safe for us . He may not 382 MARY DORIA RUSSELL have been clear about his own motives . He felt some duty toward us , perhaps . He was fond of Anne , genuinely , I believe . And we had made him a very wealthy man . He was quite empathetic for a Jana'ata . I think he could imagine to some extent what it might be like , to be alone and unsupported . ”
181883	181888	181889	181889	Sandoz	291	“ In any case , ”
181893	181920	181889	181889	Sandoz	291	“ he evidently decided to ransom us and brought us to his home and took responsibility for us . He made us part of his household . ”
181921	181936	181937	181937	John	298	“ That was when he took you to see the ivy , the staʼaka ? ”
181940	181943	181937	181937	John	298	“ Yes . ”
182005	182013	182014	182014	he	298	“ What if Marc was developing scurvy ? ”
182019	182030	182014	182014	he	298	“ Was there something you ate that Marc did n't ? ”
182458	182465	182466	182466	he	291	“ That one is not strong , ”
182573	182586	182587	182587	he	3852	“ Someone 's heart will sicken if he does not see Marc , ”
182669	182675	182676	182676	Awijan	570	“ That one is sleeping , ”
182680	182691	182676	182676	Awijan	570	“ Someone will bring you to him when he wakes . ”
182714	182727	182728	182728	he	291	“ Someone 's heart will stop if he does not see Marc , ”
182911	182915	182908	182908	someone	4267	“ Deus vult . ”
183014	183028	183029	183029	John	298	“ FATHER ROBICHAUX was in poor physical condition when this procedure took place , ”
183033	183040	183029	183029	John	298	“ and did not survive it . ”
183061	183069	183070	183072	the Father General	754	“ It must have been very difficult , ”
183075	183078	183070	183072	the Father General	754	“ Yes . "
183079	183086	183111	183111	He	291	“ And then you were alone . ”
183087	183092	183093	183093	Emilio	291	“ Oh , no , ”
183097	183110	183093	183093	Emilio	291	“ Oh , no . I believed that God was with me . ”
183147	183158	183137	183137	He	291	“ Do you believe that ? Was God with me ? ”
183215	183222	183207	183207	he	291	“ Not comedy . Not tragedy . ”
183235	183239	183240	183240	he	291	“ Perhaps farce ? ”
183253	183265	183266	183266	Sandoz	291	“ I THINK PERHAPS that I was a disappointment to Supaari , ”
183273	183299	183266	183266	Sandoz	291	“ Anne was a delight to work with , and they had enjoyed each other a great deal . I was not nearly so amusing . ”
183300	183311	183312	183312	Voelker	301	“ You were grieving and terrified and half - dead , ”
183332	183340	183327	183328	Johannes Voelker	301	“ Yes ! A poor dinner companion . ”
183367	183412	183413	183413	Sandoz	291	“ I 'm not sure Supaari really thought through the idea of formally accepting me as a dependent . It might have been a sort of spontaneous gesture of interplanetary goodwill . Maybe he wished he 'd let the government have me after all . ”
183416	183525	183413	183413	Sandoz	291	“ In any case , he seemed primarily interested in the trade aspects of the situation , and I was not much good to him as an economic adviser . He asked me if I thought that there might be other parties coming from Earth . I told him that we had radioed news of our situation back to our home planet and that it was possible others might come . We had no way of knowing when . He decided to learn English from me be- 386 MARY DORIA RUSSELL cause it is our lingua franca . He had already started to pick it up from Anne . ”
183526	183536	183537	183537	Giuliani	294	“ So . You had work as a linguist , ”
183541	183549	183537	183537	Giuliani	294	“ For a time , at least . ”
183550	183626	183537	183537	Giuliani	294	“ Yes . Supaari was making the best of things , I think . We had many conversations , once I was well enough to sort out which language I was supposed to use . It was good English practice for him , and he explained many things to me . You should be grateful to him . Most of what I un derstand about what happened came from him . He was very helpful . ”
183627	183635	183636	183636	Giuliani	294	“ How long were you with him ? ”
183639	183678	183679	183679	he	3870	“ I 'm not really sure . Six to eight months , perhaps ? I learned K’San during that time . Appalling language . The hardest I 've ever learned . Part of the joke , I suppose , ”
183699	183713	183714	183714	Giuliani	294	“ Did you hear anything of the violence that Wu and Isley reported ? ”
183725	183767	183714	183714	Giuliani	294	“ No . I was quite isolated , I assure you . I imagine , however , that with characteristic creativity , the Runa were beginning to expand on Sofia 's suggestion that they were many and the Jana’ata were few . ”
183768	183786	183787	183787	Giuliani	294	“ Wu and Isley asked after you as soon as Askama brought them to Supaari 's compound , ”
183797	183841	183794	183794	Sandoz	291	“ Supaari told them that he had made other arrangements for you . What was the phrase he used ? Ah . Here : ‘ more suited to his nature . ' Can you tell us why you were removed from the household ? ”
183848	183866	183867	183867	He	294	“ Do you know what I said to Anne Edwards once ? God is in the why . ”
183917	183943	183914	183914	him	294	“ No . I do n't know what he meant by that , except that somehow he believed he was justified in what he did . ”
183944	183950	183951	183951	Giuliani	294	“ In what he did , ”
183955	183964	183951	183951	Giuliani	294	“ You did nothing to cause your removal ? ”
183965	183970	183971	183971	Sandoz	291	" Oh , Christ ! ”
183977	183985	183986	183986	He	294	“ Even now ? After all this ? ”
184032	184106	184107	184107	He	294	“ My position in the household of Supaari VaGayjur was that of a crippled deTHE SPARROW 387 pendent . Supaari was not a flighty person , but I believe he must have tired of me . Or perhaps he simply felt that I had fulfilled my role as a language tutor when he became competent in English and that it was time for me to take up another position , so to speak . ”
184114	184136	184107	184107	He	294	“ My residential and occupational preferences were not inquired into at any time . How explicit am I required to be ? ”
185380	185384	185387	185389	the Father General	754	“ TELL US , ”
185392	185405	185387	185389	the Father General	754	“ I thought that I had been sold as a zoological specimen , ”
185430	185493	185406	185407	Emilio Sandoz	291	“ I believed , for a while , that I was in a menagerie owned by the Reshtar of Galatna . An aristocrat . A great poet . The author of many songs , yes ? A gentleman of catholic tastes . It was , in fact , a kind of harem . Like Clytemnestra , I was compelled to master submission . ”
186488	186499	186500	186501	the Reshtar	3948	“ ... BUT A PLEASING proportion , an elegant muscularity , "
186689	186692	186693	186693	It	3956	“ Lord ? ”
186698	186707	186695	186696	the merchant	6636	“ It is acceptable ? You are pleased ? ”
186708	186711	186712	186713	the Reshtar	598	“ Yes , ”
186728	186761	186718	186718	He	0	“ Yes . My secretary has the legal work in hand . You may contract the binding with my sister on whatever date seems propitious . Brother : may you have children . "
186769	186774	186775	186775	he	0	“ Leave me now , ”
187183	187197	187179	187180	Johannes Voelker	301	“ I do n't understand . What did the Reshtar want with you ? ”
187240	187270	187228	187228	Emilio	291	“ What did he want with me ? Why , the same thing a pederast wants with a little boy , I imagine . A nice , tight fit . ”
187299	187312	187313	187315	the Father General	754	“ You are many things , but you are not a coward , ”
187321	187328	187313	187315	the Father General	754	“ Face it . Tell us . "
187329	187335	187313	187315	the Father General	754	“ I have told you . "
187336	187341	187313	187315	the Father General	754	“ Make us understand . ”
187342	187362	187363	187363	Giuliani	294	“ I do n't care what you understand . It wo n't change anything . Believe what you like . ”
187399	187408	187313	187315	the Father General	754	“ For your own soul , say it . ”
187409	187416	187417	187417	Sandoz	291	“ I did not sell myself , ”
187429	187434	187417	187417	Sandoz	291	“ I was sold . ”
187435	187443	187444	187444	Sandoz	291	“ Not good enough . Say it ! ”
187565	187571	187545	187554	the man standing alone in the center of the room	3982	“ I gave no consent . ”
187572	187576	187577	187577	Giuliani	294	“ Say it , ”
187582	187588	187577	187577	Giuliani	294	“ Make us hear it . "
187589	187596	187577	187577	Giuliani	294	“ I was not a prostitute . ”
187597	187614	187577	187577	Giuliani	294	“ No . You were n't . What were you then ? Say it , Emilio . ”
187627	187632	187633	187633	They	3983	“ I was raped . ”
187671	187675	187667	187668	John Candotti	298	“ My God , ”
187707	187720	187721	187721	he	291	“ Do you think so , John ? Was it your God ? ”
187727	187842	187843	187843	he	291	“ You see , that is my dilemma . Because if I was led by God to love God , step by step , as it seemed , if I accept that the beauty and the rapture were real and true , then the rest of it was God 's will too , and that , gentlemen , is cause for bitterness . But if I am simply a deluded ape who took a lot of old folktales far too seriously , then I brought all this on myself and my companions and the whole business becomes farcical , does n't it . The problem with atheism , I find , under these circumstances , ”
187858	187894	187843	187843	he	291	“ is that I have no one to despise but myself . If , however , I choose to believe that God is vicious , then at least I have the solace of hating God . ”
187922	187938	187939	187939	he	291	“ Can you guess what I thought just before I was used the first time ? ”
187948	188048	187939	187939	he	291	“ This is rich . This is very funny ! You see , I was scared but I did n't understand what was going on . I never imagined — who could have imagined such a thing ? I am in God 's hands , I thought . I loved God and I trusted in His love . Amusing , is n't it ? I laid down all my defenses . I had nothing between me and what happened but the love of God . And I was raped . I was naked before God and I was raped . ”
188127	188131	188110	188111	Vincenzo Giuliani	294	“ Tell us . ”
188150	188155	188156	188156	Sandoz	291	“ You want more ? ”
188177	188184	188185	188185	he	3986	“ I can provide endless detail , ”
188194	188248	188249	188249	he	3986	" It went on for — I do n't know how long . Months . It seemed like eternity . He shared me with his friends . I became rather fashionable . A number of exquisite individuals came to use me . It was a form of connoisseurship , I think . Sometimes , ”
188266	188274	188249	188249	he	3986	“ sometimes , there was an audience . ”
188292	188303	188304	188304	he	3986	“ Distressing , is n't it . It gets worse , ”
188314	188364	188304	188304	he	3986	“ Extemporaneous poetry was recited . Songs were written , describing the experience . And the concerts were broadcast , of course , just like the songs we heard — is Arecibo still collecting the songs ? You must have heard some of the ones about me by now . ”
188375	188381	188382	188382	he	3986	“ They were very beautiful , ”
188388	188405	188406	188406	He	3986	“ I was required to listen , although I was perhaps inadequately appreciative of the artistry . ”
188421	188463	188464	188464	he	3986	“ Have you heard enough ? How about this : the smell of my fear and my blood excited them . Do you want more ? Would you like to know precisely how dark the night of the soul can get ? ”
188471	188502	188464	188464	he	3986	“ There was a moment when it occurred to me to wonder if bestiality is a sin for the beast , for that was certainly my role in the festivities . ”
188510	188519	188503	188503	Voelker	301	“ Does it make you want to vomit ? ”
188533	188539	188540	188540	he	291	“ Do n't be ashamed , ”
188543	188552	188540	188540	he	291	“ It happens to me all the time . ”
188563	188573	188574	188574	he	291	“ He wanted it to be my fault somehow , ”
188590	188691	188692	188692	He	291	“ He 's not a bad guy , John . It 's human nature . He wanted it to be some mistake I made that he would n't have made , some flaw in me he did n't share , so he could believe it would n't have happened to him . But it was n't my fault . It was either blind , dumb , stupid luck 396 MARY DORIA RUSSELL from start to finish , in which case , we are all in the wrong business , gentlemen , or it was a God I can not worship . ”
188702	188715	188716	188716	he	291	“ No questions ? No argument ? No comfort for the afflicted ? ”
188722	188764	188765	188765	he	291	“ I warned you . I told you that you did n't want to know . Now it 's in your minds . Now you have to live with knowing . But it was my body . It was my blood , ”
188772	188779	188765	188765	he	291	“ And it was my love . "
188813	188817	188818	188818	he	291	“ John stays , ”
188822	188829	188818	188818	he	291	“ Everyone else : get out . ”
188955	189032	189033	189033	He	291	“ After a while , the novelty wore off and it was mostly the guards who came . By that time they were keeping me in a little stone - walled room without lights . I was alone and it was very quiet , and all I could hear was my own breathing and the blood ringing in my ears . Then the door would open and I would see a flare of light beyond it . ”
189057	189141	189142	189142	He	291	“ I never knew if they were bringing food or if - if ... They kept me isolated because the screaming disturbed the others . My colleagues . The ones in the drawing you saw , back in Rome , do you remember ? Someone from the harem must have drawn it . I found it in with my food one day . You ca n't imagine what that meant to me . God left me , but someone remembered where I was . ”
189165	189190	189193	189193	he	291	“ I decided finally that I would kill the next person to come through the door , the next one who ... touched me . ”
189217	189301	189302	189302	He	693	“ I — There was nowhere to escape to . But I thought , If I 'm too dangerous , they 'll leave me alone . They 'll kill me . I thought , The next time someone comes in here , one of us is going to die , I do n't care which . But that was a lie . Because I did care . They used me hard , John . They used me hard . I wanted to die . ”
189311	189327	189302	189302	He	693	“ I wanted to die , but God took her instead . Why , John ? ”
189359	189380	189353	189353	he	298	“ Because , I suppose , souls are not interchangeable . You ca n't tell God : Take me instead . ”
189386	189417	189418	189418	He	298	“ I did n't sleep , for a long time . I waited for the door to open and I thought about how I could kill someone without my hands ... "
189432	189556	189557	189557	HE	298	“ So I waited . And sometimes I would fall asleep for a few minutes , I think . But it was so dark . It was hard to tell when my eyes were open . And then I could hear footsteps outside my cell , and I got up and stood in the far corner , so I could use the momentum , and the door opened , and I saw a silhouette , and it was so strange . My eyes already knew but my body was so primed . It was like — the nerves fired withou my telling them to . I crashed into her so hard ... I could hear the bones in her chest snap , John . ”
189655	189673	189636	189636	She	502	“ You see , Meelo ? Your family came for you . I found you for them . ”
189748	189756	189757	189759	the older man	1186	“ My God , you killed her , "
189795	189799	189800	189800	he	1186	“ My God , ”
189827	189851	189852	189852	he	1186	“ I am Wu Xing - Ren , and this is my colleague , Trevor Isley . United Nations , External Affairs Committee , ”
189876	189883	189873	189873	he	1186	“ You must be Father Sandoz . ”
189938	189963	189964	189964	His	749	“ WHY , JOHN ? Why did it all happen like that , unless God wanted it that way ? I thought I understood ... "
189981	189992	189993	189993	John	298	“ How long has it been for you , John ? ”
190025	190062	190008	190008	his	298	“ I figured it out once . Twenty - nine years . I get confused about the time , but I was fifteen and I 'm supposed to be forty - five now , I think . ”
190102	190188	190093	190093	he	291	“ See , I know a lot of men make accommodations . They find someone — someone ... to help them . But , the thing about this is : I did n't . And I — I thought I understood . It was a path to God , and I thought I understood . There are moments , John , when your soul is like a ball of fire , and it reaches out to everything and everyone equally . I thought I understood . ”
190232	190264	190209	190209	his	291	“ So , anyway , I was about forty - four , I guess , when itwhen ... it happened , so it must have been about twenty - nine years . ”
190288	190323	190324	190324	He	621	“ John , if God did this , it is a hell of a trick to pull on a celibate . And if God did n't do it , what does that make me ? "
190328	190340	190324	190324	He	621	“ An unemployed linguist , with a lot of dead friends . ”
190352	190376	190377	190377	he	621	“ So many dead , because I believed . John , they 're all dead . I 've tried so hard to understand , ”
190380	190390	190377	190377	he	621	“ Who can forgive me ? So many dead ... "
190423	190428	190420	190420	John	298	“ I forgive you , ”
190435	190442	190420	190420	John	298	“ Absolvo te - absolvo te ... ”
190458	190466	190467	190468	Felipe Reyes	379	“ THAT WAS AN abuse of power , ”
190471	190488	190467	190468	Felipe Reyes	379	“ You had no right — My God , how could you do that to him ? "
190489	190494	190495	190497	The Father General	754	“ It was necessary . ”
190560	190569	190570	190570	Reyes	379	“ How could you do that to him ? ”
190575	190587	190570	190570	Reyes	379	“ Did you get some kind of perverse pleasure from listening to~ "
190608	190671	190588	190588	Giuliani	294	“ It was necessary . If he were an artist , I 'd have ordered him to paint it . If he were a poet , I 'd have ordered him to write it . Because he is who he is , I made him speak of it . It was necessary . And it was necessary for us to hear it . ”
190769	190779	190780	190780	Felipe	379	“ Have you ever been to Florence , Reyes ? ”
190791	190794	190795	190795	he	379	“ No , ”
190799	190810	190795	190795	he	379	“ I have n't felt much like touring . Sir . ”
190811	190921	190780	190780	Felipe	379	“ You should go . There 's a series of sculptures there by Michelangelo that you should see . They are called The Captives . Out of a great formless mass of stone , the figures of slaves emerge : heads , shoulders , torsos , straining toward freedom but still held fast in the stone . There are souls like that , Reyes . There are souls that try to carve themselves from their own formlessness . Broken and damaged as he is , Emilio Sandoz is still trying to find meaning in what happened to him . He is still trying to find God in it all . ”
190967	190976	190964	190964	he	379	“ And by listening , we help him . ”
190977	191010	191027	191028	Vincenzo Giuliani	294	“ Yes . We help him . He will have to tell it again and again , and we will have to hear more and more , until he finds the meaning . ”
191037	191091	191027	191028	Vincenzo Giuliani	294	“ He 's the genuine article , Reyes . He has been all along . He is still held fast in the formless stone , but he 's closer to God right now than I have ever been in my life . And I do n't even have the courage to envy him . ”
191163	191168	191169	191171	the Father General	754	“ It was hard , ”
191174	191181	191169	191171	the Father General	754	“ Yes . It was hard . ”
191182	191186	191169	191171	the Father General	754	“ The child ? ”
191187	191197	191169	191171	the Father General	754	“ The closest legal term might be involuntary manslaughter . ”
191214	191217	191218	191218	he	298	“ No , ”
191224	191255	191218	191218	he	298	“ It was n't an accident . He meant to kill , but in self - defense . That Askama was the one who died — that was an accident . "
191256	191262	191169	191171	the Father General	754	“ Where is he now ? ”
191273	191305	191264	191264	Candotti	298	“ I carried him up to his THE SPARROW 401 room , sleeping like the dead . That 's an awful phrase . Anyway , asleep . Ed 's with him . ”
191311	191342	191343	191343	John	298	“ I think it did him good . It sure as hell did n't do me any good to hear it , but I really think he 's better now . ”
191351	191366	191343	191343	John	298	“ To dream of all that . And the children ... Now we know . ”
191367	191372	191373	191373	Giuliani	294	“ Now we know , ”
191376	191403	191404	191404	He	298	“ I 'm sitting here trying to understand why it seemed less awful when I thought it was prostitution . It 's the same physical act . ”
191440	191465	191431	191432	Sofia Mendes	330	“ I suppose a prostitute has at least an illusion of control . It 's a transaction . There is some element of consent . ”
191466	191470	191471	191472	Felipe Reyes	379	“ There is , ”
191476	191490	191471	191472	Felipe Reyes	379	“ more dignity in prostitution than in gang rape . Even by poets . ”
191500	191516	191494	191494	his	294	“ What a wilderness , to believe you have been seduced and raped by God . ”
191544	191563	191564	191564	Surprisingly	697	“ I 'll tell you something . If it 's a choice between despising Emilio or hating God — ”
191580	191603	191604	191604	He	379	“ Emilio is not despicable . But God did n't rape him , even if that 's how Emilio understands it now . ”
191624	191686	191604	191604	He	379	“ There 's an old Jewish story that says in the beginning God was everywhere and everything , a totality . But to make creation , God had to remove Himself from some part of the universe , so something besides Himself could exist . So He breathed in , and in the places where God withdrew , there creation exists . ”
191687	191693	191694	191694	John	298	“ So God just leaves ? ”
191704	191719	191694	191694	John	298	“ Abandons creation ? You 're on your own , apes . Good luck ! ”
191720	191754	191604	191604	He	379	“ No . He watches . He rejoices . He weeps . He observes the moral drama of human life and gives meaning to it by caring passionately about us , and remembering . ”
191755	191764	191765	191766	Vincenzo Giuliani	294	“ Matthew ten , verse twenty - nine , ”
191770	191786	191765	191766	Vincenzo Giuliani	294	“ ‘ Not one sparrow can fall to the ground without your Father knowing it . ”
191788	191795	191796	191796	Felipe	379	“ But the sparrow still falls , ”
191811	191822	191823	191823	Felipe	379	“ You know , he was always a good priest , ”
191834	191871	191872	191872	Felipe	379	“ but it must have been about the time that they were planning the mission , something changed in him . It was like , I do n't know , sometimes he would just - ignite . ”
191883	191920	191872	191872	Felipe	379	“ There was something in his face , so beautiful . And I thought , if that 's what it 's like to be a priest ... It was like he fell in love with God . ”
191921	191924	191926	191928	the Father General	754	“ Offhand , ”
191939	191948	191926	191928	the Father General	754	“ I 'd say the honeymoon is over . ”
192019	192025	192026	192026	Ed	293	“ What time is it ? ”
192033	192039	192040	192040	Sandoz	291	" A little after eight , ”
192079	192088	192066	192067	Brother Edward	293	“ Thank you . For staying with me . ”
192099	192105	192089	192090	Brother Edward	293	“ How do you feel ? ”
192106	192109	192110	192110	Emilio	291	“ Okay , ”
192114	192119	192110	192110	Emilio	291	“ I feel okay . ”
192150	192163	192164	192164	he	291	“ I used to be a pretty fair middle - distance runner , ”
192168	192185	192186	192186	He	291	“ I did about half a kilometer this morning . Had to walk most of it . ”
192189	192195	192186	192186	He	291	“ It 's a start . ”
192196	192202	192203	192204	Edward Behr	293	“ It 's a start , ”
192207	192217	192203	192204	Edward Behr	293	“ You did well with the coffee , too . ”
192218	192232	192233	192233	He	291	“ Yeah . Did n't crush the cup . Only spilled a little . ”
192239	192249	192233	192233	He	291	“ I 'm going to go get cleaned up . ”
192250	192255	192203	192204	Edward Behr	293	“ Need any help ? ”
192256	192265	192233	192233	He	291	“ No . Thanks . I can manage . ”
192307	192319	192320	192320	he	293	“ It 's not THE SPARROW 403 over , you know , ”
192323	192336	192320	192320	he	293	“ You do n't get over something like that all at once . ”
192350	192356	192357	192357	He	291	“ Yes . I know . ”
192367	192380	192357	192357	He	291	“ What were you , before ? A nurse ? A therapist ? ”
192390	192406	192407	192407	He	293	“ Not even close . I was a stockbroker . I specialized in undervalued companies . ”
192430	192451	192407	192407	He	293	“ It involved recognizing the worth of things that other people discounted . ' Sandoz did n't see the connection . “
192458	192459	192453	192453	you	293	” "
192471	192481	192464	192464	I	0	” Brother Edward held up his cup and said , “
192487	192530	192464	192464	I	0	” He watched Sandoz go and then , sitting very still , in silence , Edward Behr began his morning prayers . AT TEN , THERE was a metallic rap at the Father General 's door , and when he called out , “
192534	192569	192464	192464	I	0	” he was not surprised to see Emilio Sandoz enter the office , managing the lever without any hesitation and shutting the door behind him . Giuliani started to stand , but Emilio said , “
192598	192599	192581	192581	I	0	” “
192604	192609	192581	192581	I	0	” Vince Giuliani admitted . “
192619	192620	192612	192612	I	0	” “
192629	192687	192623	192623	You	0	” Sandoz looked around the office , which seemed oddly empty . Unexpectedly , he gave a short laugh and his hands went to his hair , as if to run his fingers through it , an old nervous habit , now likely to tangle the joint mechanisms of the braces . He let his hands fall . “
192697	192698	192758	192758	you	0	” “
192701	192702	192758	192758	you	0	” “

192710	192718	192758	192758	you	0	” Giuliani sat back in his chair . “
192725	192726	192721	192721	You	0	” “
192746	192752	192753	192753	John	298	” Emilio smiled but added , “
192777	192792	192773	192773	I	0	” He grimaced and turned away for a moment but came back almost immediately . “
192808	192823	192805	192805	I	0	” Giuliani said nothing , and Emilio continued , with only a little irony , “
192838	192847	192827	192827	I	0	” The corners of Giuliani 's mouth twitched . “
192861	192885	192827	192827	I	0	” Emilio went to the windows . The view was better from this office than from his room . Rank hath its privileges . “
192893	192898	192886	192886	I	0	” he said quietly . “
192942	193000	192938	192938	anyone	773	” He did n't turn from the windows . Without answering , Giuliani got up and went to a bookcase . Selecting a small volume with a cracked leather binding , he paged through it until he found what he wanted and held it out . Sandoz turned and accepted the book , looking at the spine . "
193003	193032	193001	193001	Aeschylus	699	” Wordlessly , Giuliani pointed out the passage , and Emilio studied it a while , slowly translating the Greek in his mind . Finally , he said , “
193071	193072	193069	193069	God	621	” ”
193073	193078	193079	193079	Sandoz	291	" Show - off . ”
193112	193125	193126	193126	Emilio	291	“ I was wondering if I could stay here a while longer , ”
193146	193160	193140	193140	He	291	“ You 've been very patient . I do n't mean to impose . ”
193161	193166	193167	193167	Sandoz	291	“ Not at all . ”
193186	193226	193182	193182	his	754	“ I do n't know if I 'm a priest . I do n't know if- I do n't know ... anything at all with certainty . I do n't even know if certainty is what I should want . ”
193227	193235	193182	193182	his	754	“ Stay as long as you like . ”
193236	193246	193247	193247	Emilio	291	“ Thank you . You 've been very patient , ”
193265	193268	193250	193250	He	291	“ Emilio , ”
193288	193320	193269	193271	the Father General	754	“ I 'm sending another group out . To THE SPARROW 405 Rakhat . I thought you ought to know that . We could use your help . With the languages . ”
193325	193345	193321	193321	Sandoz	291	“ It 's too soon , Vince . I ca n't think about that . It 's too soon . ”
193346	193357	193358	193358	He	291	“ Of course . I just thought you should know . ”
193610	193614	193602	193603	my mother	1578	“ Just do it ”
