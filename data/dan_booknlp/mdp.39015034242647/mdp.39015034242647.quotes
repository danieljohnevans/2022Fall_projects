And when he met that - woman - and got involved with her , he never suspected she was anything different than what she seemed .

1624	1832	1612	1613	Movie star	341	' Maybe Paul should have guessed something , or at least been a little more careful . Because he did get a warning . When he first got the job he went to a Speaker for a divination . He went to a Bead Woman actually , one of those women who use coloured beads to make their predictions . He took me along . Paul and I were really close , despite his being ten years older than me . We were each an only child and we kind of thought of each other as brother and sister , especially after Paul 's folks died in a car crash during his last year of college . So we went to this Bead Woman who said her blessings and threw out her beads on a silk scarf . Right in the centre lay a red bead with yellow bands , and all around Temporary Agency 7 it lay a circle of little black ones . And all the others had scattered to the edges of the cloth . Danger , the Speaker said . Danger and isolation . Paul asked what kind of danger , but she said she could n't tell because all the other beads had '
1834	2044	2045	2047	co - worker	343	' . They talked about it and then Paul decided that since he 'd asked about work it had to mean danger at his new job . So Paul decided to do an environmental enactment for his workplace . I helped him . It was fun . We went down to the big spiritual supply centre on 34th Street and got some sacred paper ( made from old clothes worn by the major New York storytellers ) , and some sanctified chalk and some great miniature office furniture ( I loved the little fax machine ; it was so cute ) , and some little plastic dolls to signify Paul and his co - workers , and finally a package of official SDA flash powder . Then we went downtown to Paul 's studio in the Village where he had what has got to be the smallest sanctuary you 've ever seen ( growing up in the suburbs can be pretty boring , but at least the houses all have decent - sized sanctuaries ) . We drew a circle on the floor for sacred ground and set up the office inside it . Then we labelled one of the dolls with Paul 's boss 's name and just wrote '
2048	2126	2268	2268	they	344	' on the others , and set them out . Next we took the biggest doll and wrote Paul 's name on it , including his official enactment name . While Paul marched the doll into the circle I moved the other dolls back and forth , as if they were all happy and excited about Paul 's joining the company . After that , we sang songs of harmony and success while Paul wrote out a few '
2129	2266	2268	2268	they	344	' on the sacred paper . Paul burned the paper on a silver enactment tray and then scattered the ashes on the dolls at their miniature computer desks . Finally , we sang a couple more songs , general all - purpose praise stuff , while we set off the flash powder in the silver bowl that went with the tray . And then Paul took me down to Chinatown for dim sum . Well , we certainly had fun . And maybe it would have 8 Rachel Pollack worked - if the danger had been coming from his office . But in fact it came from another office entirely , one down the hall near the restrooms . Later on , the SDA questioned Paul pretty heavily about his early encounters with the Being . I 'm

3731	4073	4782	4782	they	393	're wearing is globs of dried dirt . People dance , sometimes on one leg , people fly the most amazing kites ( some nine levels high , each with its own guardian spirit ) , people throw sanctified Frisbees painted over with patterns of perfection , groups of three hundred people or more go deep travelling in meditation together , people lie on the grass and hum for hours . . . And then there are the drums , as many as seven thousand of them . The first time Paul took me I thought we 'd all bounce up into the sky when the drums started . Paul and I considered the Central Park Drum something special between the two of us ( maybe because we had to fight so hard the first time to get my parents to let me go ) . When the second Thursday in June approached and Paul just talked about Lisa , Lisa , Lisa , I really felt like he just wanted to get rid of me . So it relieved me when he called to make a date to meet him and Lisa at Founder 's Circle on 59th Street before the start of the ceremony . The thing is , I never made it . My mom drove me to the train station and I waited there , holding my little travelling enactment bag so I could join in with the collective part of the ceremony . And I waited . I waited ten minutes , twenty minutes , half an hour , with all the commuters muttering about last straws , and robber baron prices , 12 Rachel Pollack and the other drum followers checking their watches and saying blessings , until finally a garbled loudspeaker voice told us the train was cancelled . Fire on the tracks . Next train in two hours . Maybe . I called my mom and she offered to drive me into the city . I thanked her about twenty times , calling her '
4080	4598	4782	4782	they	393	' . She laughed and said she 'd be right there . Forty minutes later , she pulled into the train station . Roadblocks all up and down the highway , she said . Industrial action by the State Police who did n't like the state budget crunch taking away their paid personal enactment days . So finally we set out , and in five minutes we had a flat tyre . No problem , I assured my mother , I 'd done tyre changing in preparation - for - driving class . With Mom worrying about me getting my good enactment dress dirty I did the tyre a little more slowly than I would have liked , but then it was finished . Off again . Mom said she 'd get the tyre fixed after she dropped me off . We got onto the highway . Clunk , clunk - another flat tyre . So that was it for my trip to meet Lisa Blackwell . By the time the AAA towed us to a gas station and did a purification ceremony on the car , I knew Paul and Lisa would be lost among the hundred thousand . That night , when I called Paul , he sounded relieved . He denied it when I told him , but I was sure I was right . He began to look different . His weight went up and down . Sometimes he 'd look as skinny as the star of a hunger enactment . Other times he looked all puffed up , like he 'd eaten nothing but doughnuts for a month . I even asked him if he was bulimic . He claimed his weight had n't changed in two years . One time he came to my house for dinner and I got the strangest feeling , like he was fading away , like I could almost see the wall right through him . His behaviour changed too . Nothing really wild . But he talked a lot . Paul always used to keep silent , especially at family parties . Now he made himself the centre of Temporary Agency 13 attention , telling jokes , spouting political theories , giving advice on the economy . And he bragged . Paul never bragged about himself , but now he was telling us all about his two promotions in two months , his special commendation from the CEO , even how much he spent for a new suit . I wanted to scream at him . Or kick him . My folks did n't notice anything . They just said was n't it great Paul was coming out of his shell ? Was n't it wonderful he was doing so well ? And in such a short time . And did n't Lisa sound sweet ? How could we have been so damn stupid ? He even told us how Lisa - wonderful sweet Lisa - had received a vision of Paul going all the way to the top . As if she 'd done a '
4601	4753	4782	4782	they	393	' and the Powers had granted her a psychic vision . Damn . If only we 'd gotten the fog out of our heads maybe we could have intervened . But it was up to Paul to recognize that something was wrong . He started getting strange dreams . There were lots of lights , he told me later , glowing on the sides of buildings , swooping down out of the skies , flaring up in front of his face . And when he 'd put his hands up or made a noise he 'd hear laughter . Except he would n't see anybody . Other dreams , instead of lights he 'd see holes . Holes in walls , in the street , in stores and lobbies of buildings . And nobody would see them but him . In the dream Paul would point out the holes to people . '
4757	4766	4767	4767	you	392	' he 'd say to an old woman , '
4768	4776	4782	4782	they	393	're going to step in that hole . '
5033	5041	5042	5042	he	133	' She can go on and on , '

5572	5718	5545	5546	the others	358	' retreats , Paul knew his problem came from another level . He kept thinking he should do something , maybe a freedom enactment . But he could never seem to do it . He would plan one , set up his sanctuary with strings of flowers and twenty - four - hour candles , spray the air with purifier , and go off to work , determined to go home right away and fulfil the inner path , as people say . Instead , he 'd let Lisa take him off to a disco and then her apartment , and by the time he 'd get home , the candles would have burned out and flower petals would lie all over the floor . One time he tied his childhood spirit string around his wrist when he went to work . Since Paul 's parents '

8240	8376	8377	8378	Silly Paul	155	' I almost blushed , knowing how dumb that sounded . When Paul got inside , he said , he ran all around , checking the bathroom , the closets , even the small cabinets under the bathroom sink . He did n't know what he was looking for , he just had to look . What could he do , he thought , what could he do ? I imagined him standing there , outside that tiny sanctuary of his , maybe hitting his hand against his forehead . While he was trying to figure out what to do next , the phone rang . Paul reached out , then stopped . When the answering machine came on , he waited through his announcement . And then she was there , telling him cheerfully , '
8409	8415	8416	8416	Paul	155	' Then her voice sharpened . '
8423	8494	8416	8416	Paul	155	' Paul told me later that he had no idea how he managed to resist . His hand moved out to the phone , he stood there almost touching it , his hand shaking . He probably would have picked it up if the doorbell had n't rung . He jerked his hand back and ran to the door . The super stood there , 22 Rachel Pollack looking confused . '
8500	8513	8416	8416	Paul	155	' he told Paul , trying to look over Paul 's shoulder . '
8518	8746	8747	8747	Ellen	158	' The answering machine , Paul told me later , had screeched , as if someone had run a fingernail along the tape . Paul thanked the super , told him everything was okay , said goodbye - and then asked him please to stay there . While the poor confused man stood in the doorway , Paul got out his carryon bag and threw in some clothes , his shaving stuff , and the cat 's claw he 'd gotten during his first winternight initiation . I 've wondered since if the super was really a Devoted One . Is n't that what they do , help you at some crucial moment ? No way to know . People always say the Benign Ones lift you gently , the Malignant Ones knock you down with a club . But Paul was n't thinking about anything like that . He just pulled his stuff together as fast as he could . And called me . I still feel good about that . He called me , his fourteenyear - old kid cousin . I know I did n't protect him , not in the long run . And I guess he did n't expect me to save him or anything . But he needed help and he called me . I 'll always love him for that . '
8749	8760	8761	8761	Ellen	158	' he said when he got me on the phone . '

9394	9436	9439	9439	Ellen	158	' It took Paul at least five minutes , during which I could hardly breathe I was so scared I 'd hear him scream or something . Finally I heard the hiss of flash powder and then , from a distance , '

9480	9792	9478	9478	Paul	133	' 1 went downstairs , acting calm so my folks would n't find out anything and panic . I figured the last thing we needed was my folks getting hysterical . They 'd call the police or something , or just start screaming and no one would do anything . I got a piece of sanctified chalk and some of my own flash powder and matches from my altar and stuck them in my skirt pocket . Then I went to the kitchen for a glass of milk and cookies . Wholesome . A kid getting a snack . I strolled outside and as soon as I was out of sight of my folks I got to work . I walked three times around the house , flicking drops of milk from the glass onto the ground as I prayed to the Hidden Mother for blessings and protection on the house and all our family . Next I crushed the cookies and scattered the crumbs along the flagstones and the driveway and out to the road , calling for Devoted Ones to flock to Paul 's aid and lead him safely out of danger to my house . In the street I drew a box for the house and then two stick figures for Paul . One showed him inside the house , holding hands with a smaller stick figure ( me ) . The other showed him outside with a circle around him , protection against a pair of bat - like wings above his head . Lisa . Then I drew dots from the Paul out in the danger place to the one safe in the house .

Outside , Lisa was waiting . I did n't need Paul to introduce us , I knew her immediately . She wore a strange triangular - shaped dress , with wide sharp shoulders and hard narrow hips . Her face shone and her golden hair lifted softly in the breeze . She stood back against a black convertible with its top down . She smiled , and for a moment I walked towards that smile , until I realized what I was doing and stopped myself . Next to me , Paul was shaking . '

I just prayed that the Guardian of Inappropriate Speech would stop Paul from saying something dumb , like how he did n't want to make any trouble and maybe he should go home .

12529	12667	12335	12335	He	133	' he said , but he just likes to take charge . So we went through the routine , mostly Daddy and I , while Mom followed along behind us . When we got back inside , my father called his lawyer . I was afraid he might not push it hard enough , but he was great . He shouted at the man , told him he had to get the best person and he had to get him right now . After my father put down the phone , we all said nothing for a while . No one looked at anybody . I do n't know how long we would have stood there like that if we did n't hear a knock at the door . My mother half shrieked , my father said , '
12671	12734	12335	12335	He	133	' Paul whimpered , and I do n't remember what I did . Because we all knew who it was . None of us moved , and then the knock came again , and then Paul started to get up . Now , Malignant Ones ca n't force their way into a house , at least for the first time , unless they 're

She did n't talk down to me , or treat me like a child or anything . She just listened and asked a lot of questions , and afterwards she said , '

The depossession team arrived half an hour later , two men and a woman , all carrying old - fashioned black doctor bags . They wore one - piece protective suits , heavytread boots , insulated gloves and animal head masks . The woman was small , about my height . She wore a crocodile mask and on the groin of her protective suit she 'd handpainted a silver circle over two wavy blue lines - the moon of power over the river of continuous birth . I could n't take my eyes off her . While they unpacked their equipment , my mother asked , '

They gave each of us a smaller pump and told us to spray ourselves every time we left the house . Before they left , the elephant warned us not to allow any strangers into our house . '

For quite a while I sat there , holding it in my hands , looking at the way she just stood there , as firm as a tree on the stone steps of the court . We saw Ms Birkett thirteen days later . Those two weeks were really hard for me . They were hard for everyone , of course , and I guess I was as scared as the others , but I also had to speak to my friends and everyone , and not tell them what had happened . I stayed in the house as much as possible , telling my friends I was sick , but of course they still called . Like my best friend , Barb , who wanted to tell me about trips to the beach and the club . I could n't tell her how I 'd faced a Malignant One , or that I 'd spoken with Alison Birkett . My parents asked me to keep it secret , but I would have anyway . I did n't want to push my luck . I could talk to Paul , of course . And I did , except sometimes that just made it worse . Maybe I should n't say this , but he got so depressed , he kept saying how he was putting everybody in danger , how Lisa had '

On the way , I could hear Paul , crying or something , but I could n't pay any attention . When I got back to the bathroom my folks were stuffing things down the toilet bowl . Fighting not to vomit , I sprayed the toilet , the floor and the air , my parents , myself , all the while repeating the Standard Formula , as well as our own enactment spells and the ones the team had taught us . The flooding stopped . We all leaned against the walls , gasping . '

16585	16867	16868	16868	I	0	' Then I ran to tell my folks the news . The office was a little smaller than I 'd expected . There was a desk - some kind of dark red wood - and some leather - chairs , and walls of books , most of them in sets of twenty or so volumes . I wondered how many years you had to go to school to learn all that stuff . Alison Birkett was a little fatter than she 'd looked on the cover of Time . A little shorter , too , but otherwise she looked just like I 'd imagined her as I lay awake half the night . Wavy red hair which she pushed back from her face . Narrow nose and wide mouth , which gave her face a lot of movement , a lot of expression . When she frowned , you really could see it . When she smiled , she let it take over her face . She wore a grey silk blouse open at the neck and with the sleeves rolled up slightly , and a straight dark purple skirt . Round her neck , on a silver chain , she wore the three peaked medallion of the Winged Lady of the Mountains . Just above her left wrist I could see a small crescent - shaped scar , a mark of initiation . She noticed my looking at it . Her eyes dropped to her arm and then back at me , and she smiled . She shook all our hands and said our names without our telling her . When she came to me she nodded once and said , '
16869	16879	16911	16911	her	0	'm very pleased to meet you , Ms Pierson . '

16963	17009	16959	16960	Ms Birkett	174	' I know . Just hearing about it sickened me . I am very sorry you had to suffer such an outrage . As I told your daughter , however , it will not happen again . And the SDA will pay for the damage . '

17019	17060	17015	17016	my father	323	' Let me explain what I 've found out . To begin with , the F.I. request turned out to be quite a battle . Our government agencies do not like giving up their secrets . Especially the embarrassing ones . '

17252	17384	17385	17385	I	0	' That 's right . Various agencies , investigatory arms and , I suspect , the White House , though sections of the report came blacked out . " National Security Sanctification . " One part that was not censored , however , described the involvement of one particular client of Black Dust 7 . The Spiritual Development Agency hires her services on a very steady basis . When Mr Cabot and Ms Pierson came for Temporary Agency 43 help they spoke first to an underling . Someone " not in the loop " as the expression goes . When Mr Sebbick came on the case , however , the situation changed dramatically . For Mr Sebbick knew Lisa Black Dust 7 's cover name and the location of her operation . '
17388	17404	17385	17385	I	0	' So the noble SDA tried to shut us up in order to protect themselves . '

17562	17581	17558	17559	Ms Birkett	174	' Spying , sabotage , manoeuvering decisions by other agencies , or even other governments . Possibly assassinations . '

17910	17961	17907	17907	she	0	' is a cease and desist order , issued this morning by Judge Malcom Bennett . Judge Bennett is a very useful man . A number of times , when the government and I have come to an agreement , Judge Bennett has given it the appearance of judicial compulsion . '
17965	17975	17962	17962	Daddy	144	' What exactly do they cease and desist doing ? '
17976	18020	18021	18021	Mom	150	' The order , in fact , does not restrain them so much as compel them . It requires the SDA to cease protecting Black Dust 7 and to begin protecting you and your family . In short , to do its duty . '
18024	18038	18021	18021	Mom	150	' But that horrible . . . that disgusting . . . yesterday — '

18185	18224	18180	18180	She	699	' No . It does require the government to cease all dealings specifically with Black Dust 7 and her agency . It does not , however , require anything further from them . The language is very careful . '

Finally we had to leave . My folks shook her hand and hurried out of the office . Paul shook her hand , too , but he did n't look at her . I think he was crying . The escort team , two women without any masks but carrying government sanctified electronic spirit dispersers , waited in the doorway . They looked bored . I got up last and shook her hand , trying to do it as strong as she did . I Temporary Agency 47 was halfway to the door when she called to me . '

18987	19061	18983	18983	you	158	' And then I left . The depossession took five days . To be honest , it was mostly kind of dull . We had to go to an SDA safe house upstate , along the Hudson . It was very pretty , with views of the cliffs and lots of woods . Except we did n't get to look around much . We chanted and sweated and wrote things on paper and made '
19063	19376	18938	18938	I	0	' ( dolls , that is ; you should have seen my father 's ! ) . At least we got to do some stuff down by the river , at night . Most of the time , however , I had to sit in my room , or else lie down on a surgical table while people in lab coats and sanctified masks ( I kept looking for the crocodile woman but she never showed ) smeared creams and smelly oils on me and wiped them off , or painted pictures and wrote words on my belly , or else ran tests with electrodes attached to my head , lights shining in my face , and so on . I do n't know what I was expecting , maybe the building shaking , slime pouring out of the walls , shrieks and wild laughter - you know , the kind of thing you see on TV shows . Only once did something really weird happen , and it was n't the kind of thing you expect . It was night time and they 'd taken me down to the river again , a small cove with a ring of metal poles near the edge of the water . My caseworker tied a black silk blindfold around my eyes and then directed me to sit down in the centre of the ring . The poles gave off a low rhythmic hum . For a while I just thought about school or something . Slowly , the hum got louder and my head started to hurt . Suddenly , I heard giggles behind me . I turned my head , frightened . Why were the techs giggling ? But the sound 48 Rachel Pollack came from somewhere further back , somewhere in the woods . I reached up to pull off the blindfold . '

19535	19570	19461	19461	Ellen	158	' my caseworker told me . I could hardly hear her , the roaring in the poles had gotten so loud . It ran from pole to pole , round and round the ring . '
19576	19651	19573	19573	you	158	' the caseworker asked . I shook my head . Alison Birkett 's voice called my name again . When I looked again , she and Black Dust 7 were kissing each other and doing things with their hands I do n't want to describe . And suddenly I could feel them touching me , sliding invisible hands all over my body . I thrashed around like someone slapping away a swarm of bugs . '
19656	19669	19461	19461	Ellen	158	' my caseworker said again , but I just shouted at her , '

Trying to ignore the laughter and those horrible hands all over me , I closed my eyes , took a breath - and said all the formulas and prayers the techs had been teaching me over the past few days . The laughter died away , the hands became feathers . And I wanted them back . I wanted to stop the chants and the formulas , I wanted to bring back the voices , the hands . I felt so lonely , so ashamed . Alison Birkett would hate me , no one would ever love me . No one ever had loved me . But now these two wonderful beings had come Temporary Agency 49 to rescue me . Why was I driving them away ? Did n't I know they only played a game , pretending to be enemies so they could trick the idiots , like my parents and the SDA ? They could n't fool me , they knew that . I was much too smart for any of that . Why was I driving them away ? If I joined them the three of us could do anything . They needed me , Alison Birkett needed me . If I turned her down now , she 'd never speak to me again . Thank mine and everyone else 's guardians that the caseworker did n't say or do anything . I 'm

Behind me the laughter stopped . I said the protection again , louder this time . The boy 's face spasmed and he dropped his spray can . Wow . I grinned . You bastards , I thought , I 've got something that can make you hurt . I was tempted to go after them , but instead I just got myself out of there . I backed out of the door , and when I got to my bike I held on tight to my medallion and kept saying the words while I fumbled open the lock . Finally I got it free and rode off as fast as I could .

At the last moment , Paul said his protection and the taxi suddenly blew out all four tyres so that it grated to a stop halfway up the sidewalk . In the middle of all the screaming people Paul escaped the car and ran up to his office , where he locked the door and called Ms Birkett . While she told me the news , she kept her fist clenched . I kept expecting her to bang it on the desktop . She also Temporary Agency 53 told me how Paul had encountered signs all week long and ignored them . The phone would ring and he 'd hear nothing but liquid sounds , like running water . Once , he was taking a shower and the water became incredibly sweet , like perfume . And one night he was watching TV when instead of a commercial he just heard a soft voice calling his name over and over . '

She was sarcastic , she threatened him , she sounded like a school principal putting down a gym teacher .

21937	21958	21816	21817	Jack Moralty	185	' to keep their commitments and constrain Black Dust 7 . He promised to investigate , to let her know ( '

Though my folks made a weak protest , and I did n't like the idea at all , we let Ms Birkett convince us we had to get some scientific basis for what was going on . At least it was n't like the hospital . They did n't strap me down or anything , and they did all the testing in a large open room with a carpet and couches . As a government agency , the SDA displays portraits of the president in all their offices . You know the kind - an official government photo of our nation 's leader smiling blankly in his official bird costume and sacred headdress , with painted - in guardian spirits hovering in the background , like Secret Service agents . In the middle of all their testing , when I realized none of it was going to do anything worse than bore me , I started looking around the room and my eyes clicked on the president 's portrait . Paul was there . His face looked down at me from underneath the president 's jewelled and feathered cap of office . '
29484	29489	29481	29481	he	997	' I told them . '
29497	29543	29481	29481	he	997	' They all stared and then a bunch of them ran over with their meters and gauges . By the time they 'd reblessed their equipment the photo had changed back again , but that did n't stop them . After about ten minutes they announced '
29553	29617	29481	29481	he	997	' SDA people love talking like that . They went back to me after that and tested me all the rest of the afternoon . Later , I found out they had sent teams to the various places and objects where I 'd told them I 'd seen Paul . At the end of the day they reported that early indications showed that the '
29619	29641	29481	29481	he	997	' were genuine ( I figured that that meant I was n't crazy ) Temporary Agency 71 and did not come from '
29644	29726	29727	29727	Ellen	158	' . That was why the protection teams had n't picked up anything . They 'd set their monitors for Bright Beings only . The investigators said they needed to do further tests and run computer analyses , but I could go home . Wait a minute , I told them . Go home ? What did they plan to do ? Analyze . Examine . Ponder . Report in five days . I jumped up and strode from the office . '
29729	29871	29727	29727	Ellen	158	' Alison Birkett called , but I did n't turn . A moment later , my folks came scurrying after me . The week went more quickly than I thought it would . Paul appeared twice - once as my school principal in the middle of an assembly , the second time as a kid running out of a store , with the store owner chasing him and calling him a thief . I almost joined the chase , but I knew it would n't do any good . Even if I 'd caught him , he would have changed back again . Six days later ( it took them an extra day ) we were all back there ; me , my folks , Ms Birkett , her own team , the SDA techs , and their boss , a real '
29873	29915	30051	30053	the SDA people	999	' as Alison called such people . Only now two other people had come along ; government lawyers in their dark suits and short haircuts . Alison had invited them . Summoned them was more like it . Told them they would '
29923	30050	30051	30053	the SDA people	999	' . So they came and sat upright , frowning at both the SDA and Alison Birkett , who appeared very relaxed in an antique chair with curved arms and a flared back . She wore a dark gold suit and had her hair combed back from her face . Leaning back in her chair she set her right elbow on the chair arms and rested her chin in the bridge between her first and second fingers . She looked the absolute model of fascination as she listened to the techs explain what was happening . It must have taken some doing even to look fascinated . The whole thing was about me and Paul , but I still felt like going to sleep . Transcendental biology '

I did n't want to tell Joan what I thought of SDA certifications . Or Bead Workers , for that matter . But that was no criticism of her . I did n't talk about stuff like that with anyone . So there was Joan , sitting on the edge of her wooden chair with red and yellow beads caught in her hair from where the woman poured them over her head , and me doing my best to stare out at 7th Avenue through all the ancestral statues , offering stones and other junk hung in the window , and wishing I could shake out the beads still stuck in my hair , without that SDA certified malpractitioner scolding me for '

34915	35216	34914	34914	they	1106	're not . Miracle Park was a homeless haven despite all the efforts of the police to exorcise them . In the early morning you could see middle - aged men and women and runaway kids curled up on the benches under the small shell which was supposed to be for bands but never was . I remember 88 Rachel Pollack once when I could n't sleep , going down to the park and seeing two kids with shaved heads and torn shirts which looked like they came from one of those paramilitary academies , like the Latterday Army of the Saints . The kids were holding a pair of thin foam mattresses , rolled up as if they were too precious to stretch them out on the dewy ground , and they were whispering and giggling , with the park lamps lighting up tattoos from homecoming enactments on the top of their heads . I stood there and thought how they were n't much older than I had been when all that stuff happened . When Paul got taken . And I remember thinking , now here I was , Paul 's age . Except I would get older and Paul would stay the same , forever . I just about ran from the park , with the kids laughing behind me , probably thinking I was some straight who wanted to do an offering of protection against losing her home and finding herself in the tribe . So there would have been homeless in Miracle Park no matter what . But in fact , Timmerman rallies always drew homeless people , from his first speeches back in New Chicago . Maybe you remember how the police tried to chase them off , and Timmerman shouted at the cops to '
35229	35285	35286	35287	professional cynics	1113	' That line , and the footage of the shabby people reaching up to the stage to touch the Beautiful Ones , the famous still photo of a gnarled diseased hand in a tattered glove reaching up for perfect fingers , these more than anything , were what made Timmerman famous . Timmerman 's detractors - '
35288	35327	35286	35287	professional cynics	1113	' he called them - claimed that the blessing of the homeless at his rallies was stage - managed , a fake . They pointed out how few homeless people actually showed up , and implied that Timmerman 's '
35329	35809	35286	35287	professional cynics	1113	' spread the word on the street that crowds would not be welcome and the drunks and crazies especially should just stay away . I do n't know . Until I got involved , I did n't care enough to investigate . Then later , things just got too complicated . Temporary Agency 89 It was true that that day Harry and I did n't see more than fifty or sixty homeless people in the small crowd . They 'd set up a shrine , though , off on the side . Not a bad job . They 'd made a frame with pieces of wood and pipe and some crates and cardboard boxes . They 'd decorated it with scraps of paper , bird feathers , bottle caps and a couple of rolls of toilet paper draped as streamers . Marker - drawn pictures of Miguel Miracle of the Green Earth ( plus a couple of Rebecca Rainbow , for prosperity , and even one of Li Ku Unquenchable Fire , maybe for defiance ) , some drawn on paper bags or sheets of newspapers , were thumbtacked to the frame . Some had sayings and invocations , in English , Spanish or Russian , written over the eyes and mouth . In the shrine 's centre , on a little wooden platform , stood a sanctified dollhouse . Judging from the broken pieces and the stains , the enactors probably found it on the street . Probably some stockbroker decided to get a fancier model in the hopes of moving up to a townhouse , and had thrown away the spirit aid which had brought him to where he was now . I wondered if a model home kept its certified SDA sanctification if you found it on the street . I wondered if an SDA sanctification meant anything even when you got it right from the store . The homeless people who 'd made the shrine did n't seem to share my doubts . They 'd drawn arrows outside the shrine to the open room in the centre , which they 'd filled with representations , some of them actual dolls ( a few looked old enough to have survived since childhood ) and some just twigs or cardboard cutouts . I imagined the ceremony , maybe late at night , with all the park people chanting together as they marched their proxies from the cold outdoors into the spiritual warmth of the dollhouse . Around the outside of the whole shrine I noticed the blackened dust left over after burning a large amount of flash powder . You never saw that at home when I was growing up . Any time we did a family enactment my 90 Rachel Pollack mother got out the vacuum cleaner almost before we 'd finished the chants and gestures for '
35813	35929	35286	35287	professional cynics	1113	' . I think that Mom believed that leaving a mess destroyed the power of the enactment . Amid the ashes in the park I saw small deposits of unburned powder . Probably got wet , I thought , until it occurred to me that maybe they pissed on it . Some people believe that urine around the border of a shrine truly raises it to the level of true ground . Separates it from its entanglement in everyday reality . My mother preferred vacuum cleaners . Standing there , I remembered something I 'd seen once . It was right after Paul 's ascent to guardianship ( yes , I know the usual term is '
35931	35974	35286	35287	professional cynics	1113	' , but I do n't think that would go too well in this instance ) . Right after I stopped seeing Alison . I had gotten that feeling I sometimes got those days , that I could n't breathe in my parents '
36345	36478	36344	36344	I	0	'm not sure of this part , because it feels like I dreamed it or something - they blew kisses at me . What I am sure of is the sweet smell of flowers and the feeling of safety , so powerful I felt like I could howl and cry all night long . I did n't . What I did was run . I ran home as fast as I could . I did my best to push the whole thing out of my mind . I used schoolwork , TV , gossip , and even an obnoxious boy named Johhny Olden , who believed he was in love with me . I thought about it , sometimes . Like when I had to pee . And once , during a Girls '

36616	36653	36613	36613	Harry	201	' No , really . Sometimes he acts like he wants to bring back the Revolution , and other times he just spends all his energy on food labels , mattress fillings , and windshield wipers . '
36657	36670	36718	36718	Harry	201	' Maybe his mother told him that genius lies in the details . '

36739	36800	36718	36718	Harry	201	' Someone behind us shushed him . He blew imaginary smoke into the air . A man and a woman came out of the van and started circling the stage area , making wide sweeping gestures with their arms . They were caked in mud , giving their bodies a look of ancient grey deserts . Harry whispered to me , '
36815	36978	36979	36979	he	1135	' This time , I shushed him . On top of the mud the men and women had pasted ( I guess ) dollar bills , advertising circulars , street handouts for discos and discount stores , and pictures of smiling women holding their breasts with 900 numbers across the nipples . When they 'd completed their circle , they stepped back to stand a little way apart facing the audience . With a loud grunt they crashed their hands together like cymbals - and burst into flames . All over their bodies the paper and mud were burning , while the two stood impassively , their hands clasped and their heads bent forward , like the people you sometimes see in government office buildings , hired to promote a spiritual atmosphere . Except these people were on fire . I admit I gasped with everyone else , except Harry who kept his cool . Think they 'll give me a light ? '
37023	37046	37019	37019	someone	384	' How about that ? That 's better than those horses he used in Boston . Only in New York , huh ? '

Or they counteract some Malignant intervention , like the waitress who tripped and spilled coffee on the supposed travelling salesman who was hypnotizing Governor 94 Rachel Pollack Chichester to keep her from reaching the presidential debate studio . So how did Timmerman manage it ? Fasting ? Enactments in dark caves , or the desert , to purify his purpose , '
37493	37502	37354	37356	the Ferocious Ones	1157	' ? Or did the Devoted Ones , his '
37506	37539	37541	37542	my God	1159	' as the press called them , attach themselves to his campaign for their own inscrutable purposes ? Two figures walked out from the audience and turned to stand alongside Alex Timmerman . '

37568	37721	37562	37562	I	0	' They appeared as a man and a woman , though as far as anyone knew the categories did n't mean anything to Bright Beings . Just shells of appearance . The man wore a suit , grey like Timmerman 's , with a red tie loosened at the neck . The woman wore a skirt and blouse and running shoes , like those office workers who keep their high heels in their desks ( I found myself wondering if she 'd modelled herself after women seen only in the street ) . Their faces and hands gleamed with a light that first flickered , then gleamed in intensity , as if they 'd turned up a rheostat . At the same time , their faces drained of expression until they looked like mannequins in a department store . With a roar that made me wince , the crowd all chanted together , '
37744	37787	37788	37788	You	141	' And then they began to push forward , everyone hoping to touch the Spirits , palm to palm , finger to finger . It was all I could do to stay upright . The only other person not moving was Harry . '

She 'd done her eyes in heavy black liner , giving them a deep hollow look . Either she was naturally pale or had made her face up white , with no blusher , but dark red lipstick . She was just standing there , just watching the crowd and the Benign Ones working the audience like an auctioneer at an estate sale . But something about her made me forget the noise and the pushing , Timmerman 's crowing about '
38075	38112	38113	38113	Harry	201	' , even Froggy 1 and Froggy 2 ( do n't ask me why I called Our Devoted Friends that , maybe from the way they hopped back and forth in front of the mob ) . '
38115	38124	38113	38113	Harry	201	' I said . He made a noise . '

38161	38326	38156	38156	I	0	' I said . Finally , marshals came out to escort the divine guests away from the crowd . Though a few people shouted that they had n't had their turn , that it was n't fair and what about their rights , Timmerman quieted them down through platitudes about spreading the power through devoted humans . Or maybe it was n't such a platitude . The people who 'd been touched seemed compelled to touch others . They kept putting their hands on each other , or hugging , or rubbing against each other , sliding 96 Rachel Pollack and lifting , sometimes kissing , sometimes moving their hands along each other 's backs or thighs . It was sexual and very overt , yet very innocent , as if ... as if nothing was expected to come of it . Most of our touching , even necking , locks into a context of messages , like This is going to lead to screwing '
38337	38340	38156	38156	I	0	' , or '
38347	38350	38130	38130	Timmerman	204	' , or '
38365	38412	38130	38130	Timmerman	204	' These people reminded me of the three - year - old son of a friend of mine , who after I 'd taken a shower and was wearing his mother 's bathrobe , came up and put a hand straight on my crotch , saying , '
38418	38717	38414	38414	you	1172	' There was no message in the touching , just the excitement of contact . And yet , there was an intensity , a kind of burning under the surface , that was both exciting and frightening . Mostly they touched each other , and it did n't matter if it was a student , or a yuppie , or some homeless kid whose clothes and body stank . They just wanted to touch , to kiss . But they also reached out to those who had n't received the blessing , and while some drew back , others laughed , a little embarrassed , but joined in , like housewives rinding themselves in a group sex enactment and discovering that once they 've got the paint and the little bells on , and slashed their clothes , and set the cakes on fire , and started faceless screwing , that they like it and why have they never done this before ? And it was n't just people they touched . A few of them would stroke or rub against the trees , even kissing the branches , the way you might kiss down the length of your lover 's arm . One person was sliding her body along the length of a park bench . Another bent down to reach for a squirrel . When the squirrel ran away from him , he just made circles on the blacktop with his hands spread wide , as if to take in as much surface as possible . Harry said something about Timmerman and brotherhood , but I was n't listening . I felt strange watching them . Temporary Agency 97 There were n't really that many ; maybe twenty or thirty who 'd actually received the touch . '
38723	39106	39107	39107	Ellen	158	' I thought . I remember those words , the sentence forming in my mind . And then I looked at the woman standing behind Timmerman . She had n't moved , she just stood there , with her black - rimmed eyes looking vaguely across the crowd . For a moment I thought she was looking at me . I jerked my head back , closed my eyes and opened them again . Her gaze had shifted . Timmerman was talking about human liberation and economics , citing statistics and trends along with his slogans , and it really did seem like people were listening , paying attention . Not noticing all that touching , all those people rubbing against each other , against lamp posts and garbage cans . I felt clumsy , like I had too many arms and legs and no idea where to put them . Two women , very tall , wearing nylon wigs , were passing money back and forth , sliding it against parts of their bodies and laughing , not just the official sexual parts , though certainly those too , but elbows , behind the knees , around the wrists , the small of the back , touching everywhere like a whip drawn slowly back and never cracked . . . I 've got to get out of here , I thought . Somewhere soft where I could think . Soft ? I thought of Harry , but instead of telling him we had to go I just imagined the cold tip of his prosthetic cigarette climbing slowly up my spine . In the front of the crowd a man had taken off his shirt and jacket and was sliding his necktie all over his upper body . A child had turned the jacket inside out and put it on , hugging the fabric against herself . Everyone was smiling , moaning , while Alex Timmerman told them about consumer fraud and children 's spirit vocalizations , leveraged buyouts and sacred agonies of democratic change . I wanted to look at Harry and did n't dare , certain he would slide against me and start pulling my hair , slowly pulling my head back . . . And then the voice came . '
39109	39113	39107	39107	Ellen	158	' it said . '
39117	39406	39407	39407	Alison	174	' 98 Rachel Pollack She might as well have shoved me , as hard as she could . I felt grateful and angry , grateful she 'd pulled me loose from Timmerman 's cadres , furious that it had to be her , that it was n't Harry , or just my own will . Why had n't I left ? Why could n't I have stayed home ? Or gone off with Joan ? How did I look ? Could she have been anything ? Was I sweating ? Would she see it in my face if I turned around ? Could I just walk away , maybe move into the crowd , as if I needed to hear Timmerman more clearly ? Maybe I could abandon dignity and run like hell . I turned around . My relief astonished me when I saw she did n't look old . A few more lines but hardly any grey hairs . More casual clothes than years ago - a blue silk zipper jacket over a pale yellow blouse and pleated pants belted with a gold weave cloth belt . Her hair looked softer , not as chic as I remembered ( though how could I trust my fourteen - year - old just - a - kid sensibility ? ) . Cut fairly short , brushed back along the sides . And her figure had n't changed , no sloppiness or sagging . Probably worked out in a gym , I thought , and could hardly believe my own nastiness . I did n't dare think what I looked like . I 'd sure as hell changed a lot more in the last thirteen years than she had . '
39409	39413	39407	39407	Alison	174	' I said . '
39416	39500	39407	39407	Alison	174	' Silence . Behind me , the loudspeakers blared Timmerman speaking about hospitals and spiritual malpractice . I could hear laughter and drawn - out sighs and knew that the blessed were still touching each other and everything else they could reach . It no longer mattered much ( except that I discovered I wanted to talk about it with her , get her opinion ) . Harry 's hand waving his pc stopped me from trying to think of something to say . '

39605	39721	39735	39736	Mr Astin	216	' as people say . I 'd thought about telling him . If anyone , it would have been Harry . But then I always decided that if he did n't know about Paul and everything else , I did n't want to pop my bubble of a normal life . But Harry still might have known Alison Birkett 's name . For that matter he might have known my whole history and just respected my reticence . He sucked on his pc until it glowed and then waved it grandly towards Timmerman and the crowd . When I looked I noticed that the woman with the black ringed eyes had left . Harry said , '
39726	39730	39735	39736	Mr Astin	216	' Alison said , '

42025	42180	42011	42011	Alison	174	' Despite my eight - year hiatus , some habits are hard to break . I began with that question . I spoke to people from the papers , the networks . Some of the incidents they knew about , some they 'd never even heard of . In each case , however , a decision was made somewhere along the line to suppress the story . Often , it seems , without any conscious connection to the previous cases . Mary Howell , at the LA Times , seemed genuinely surprised and upset when I pointed out to her that she had decided against Timmerman stories on three separate occasions . I Temporary Agency 105 suggested to her that she print the story now . " Emerging pattern , disturbing questions . " She promised me she would think about it . Think about it ? Of course , nothing has been printed . '

42203	42251	42252	42252	I	0	' Of course I thought about that . But I could n't find any trace of government interference . And why would the government want to protect Alexander Timmerman ? He certainly does n't represent business as usual , which is generally the government 's first priority . '

42778	42863	42760	42760	Alison	174	' . Extremely tall - six feet three inches - Kathy grew up embarrassed and ashamed of sticking out above all the boys , let alone the girls , until one day she got a good haircut , put on some makeup and a short skirt , and discovered she was beautiful . Now she spends half her time looking in mirrors and the other half designing software for a cosmetics company - except when she 's gossiping about her friends . Kathy said , '

43571	43595	43538	43538	they	1250	' Very little . Just that Timmerman seems to have the Living World on his side and no one wants to touch him . '
43596	43601	43556	43556	She	1249	' And the police ? '
43602	43655	43538	43538	they	1250	' I spoke with them after Jack died .

43970	43991	43966	43966	I	0	' I 'd invite you up for tea , but it 's the sixth floor and the elevator 's broken . '
43996	44028	44029	44029	I	0	' she said , just as a whirring noise signalled the arrival of the elevator from upstairs . Though Alison pretended not to notice , I waved a hand and said , '
44043	44409	44410	44412	Maggie Tunnel Light	183	' Absolutely not , I told myself . No way was I going to involve myself in some pet conspiracy project of Alison Birkett . So her friend got mashed by a mob . Maybe she could get him a gig as guardian of water coolers . She 's good at that . If I did some checking , I told myself , it was n't for her . I was just curious . I certainly was n't going to go to her office and read any of her files . But what harm would it do , just for curiosity , to do some private enquiries into Great Brother Alex and his pet Devoted Ones ? And besides , I needed to keep away from the house and the telephone . Now that she 'd broken the ice ( smashed it was more like it ) , Ms Birkett could take it into her head to call me at any moment . Or worse , Joan Monteil might call . I could screen my calls , but I hated jumping every time the phone rang , then waiting nervously through the next four rings and the outgoing message before whoever it was would come on the line . So the next morning I set out for the library , where for three days I scanned through old magazines and newspapers for articles on Alexander Timmerman and his Consumer Liberation organization . I did n't expect any scandals or revelations . If Alison said none of the disturbing events had gotten into the newspapers I believed her . On that level I was sure she knew what she was doing . I just wanted a sense of what Timmerman was about , the kind of issues he was raising , what legal actions , if any , Temporary Agency 111 he 'd taken against corporations or the government , what impact the Choir of Angels was having beyond raising the spiritual ( read sexual ) temperature at his rallies . And I wanted to see what articles had appeared on Timmerman 's dark - haired Friend , whom I was already calling in my mind , '
44413	44441	44410	44412	Maggie Tunnel Light	183	' . About the last , not much . In fact , very little appeared on the Benign Ones at all . Spiritweek had an article in the '
44444	44459	44410	44412	Maggie Tunnel Light	183	' section on Consumer Liberation , reporting that a third Devoted One had joined the '
44464	44501	44410	44412	Maggie Tunnel Light	183	' as Timmerman 's press person put it . There was , of course , no picture of Maggie . I remember hearing once that someone had invented a computer - linked camera that could create an '
44504	44579	44410	44412	Maggie Tunnel Light	183	' image of a Bright Being . Supposedly , the SDA had slapped a restraining order on the inventor and the camera never got produced . The article did run a photo of Timmerman in his mask and grey suit , with surges of light behind him , a trick I knew I could duplicate on my computer any time I wanted . The text said precious little . Timmerman and his aides described their '
44582	44592	44410	44412	Maggie Tunnel Light	183	' that the Living World was supporting their campaign to '
44604	44636	44410	44412	Maggie Tunnel Light	183	' . At the same time , they insisted that they had not sought out Margaret at all , but rather that she had approached them , appearing in their office , '
44642	44659	44410	44412	Maggie Tunnel Light	183	' , just after their yearly convention . According to the article , Ms Light would not '
44661	44679	44410	44412	Maggie Tunnel Light	183	' directly with the public - no blessings in other words - but would help the inner staff '
44691	44829	44410	44412	Maggie Tunnel Light	183	' . As for the other two - Albert Comfort the Children 6 and Jeannette Benevolent Fire 31 - Timmerman had not exactly summoned them either , not in the formal sense of an operation to secure a Benign One for personal service . According to the official Consumer Liberation line , Timmerman had suffered some personal trauma or 112 Rachel Pollack other ( they were coy about just what had happened , which probably meant sexual rejection ) and had set out on a pilgrimage to the ruins of the nuclear power plant along the Hudson River . Either from accident or from deliberately coating himself in hot ash , Alexander came close to death , only to be healed by the sudden manifestation of Albert and Jeannette , who removed his burns and gave him his '
44832	44938	44410	44412	Maggie Tunnel Light	183	' ( the helmet mask ) as a sign of service . I wondered how much of this puff story to believe . As flattering as it was to Timmerman , it somehow rang true with my own sense of the Happy Twins ( my term for them ) . There was something simple minded about them , as if , like so many Devoted Ones , they just wanted to help humanity lift itself from pain . In one of the articles , Timmerman 's press manager hinted that Albert and Jeannette were really one entity who appeared in two forms because of humanity 's '
44942	44980	44410	44412	Maggie Tunnel Light	183	' . Very little appeared beyond these official accounts . The Times ran a feature on the Devoted Ones in Timmerman 's campaign , and more broadly on the place of the Living World in contemporary society , '
44986	45040	44410	44412	Maggie Tunnel Light	183	' . Like so many Times articles , it managed to sound deep without saying much of anything . The Washington Post and The Miami Herald of Power and a few other papers ran editorials . None of them said much of anything , though the Post warned of the need for humans to '
45051	45073	44410	44412	Maggie Tunnel Light	183	' . More interesting to me was a sense of the campaign itself - what Timmerman was trying to achieve . I 'm
45147	45159	45167	45167	he	1258	' liberating all levels , including the intimate teachings of the Spirit '
45298	45392	45291	45291	its	1263	' campaign when he began doing daily protection enactments outside corporate headquarters , enactments which attracted more and more people as news reports surfaced of Nightleopard accidents on deserted roads in clear weather , or new cars breaking down or catching fire . Without his enactments , Timmerman claimed , the disasters would have been more frequent and worse . Nevertheless , SM managed to get a court order forcing him to stop . Refusing , Timmerman went to jail , but a higher court ruled that the mass enactments were a collection of '
45396	45501	45291	45291	its	1263	' rather than an organized ceremony , which meant that SM would have needed restraining orders against every single person holding up a placard , or burning flash powder on pictures of SM 's CEO , or moving dummies in radio - controlled models of Nightleopard cars . Finally , the company gave up and released the records of the work done to draw up proper sanctification for the car before release to general sales . Two weeks later the car was withdrawn . While none of Timmerman 's later cases had attracted 114 Rachel Pollack that much publicity , his workers , known as '
45505	45678	45291	45291	its	1263	' for their fanaticism , had scored a run of large and small successes , taking on everything from soup companies to federal bureaucracies . As I skimmed the press reports , I noticed all the hard work behind Timmerman 's rhetoric , the nuts and bolts and research and carefully built legal challenges that had made a registered sanctified letter from Consumer Liberation a terrifying sight for any executive or government official . When the stories approached the present , say the past six months , something else emerged . I began to pick up a shift in emphasis from manufactured products and insurance companies to the banking system . There were charges and actions against specific banks , accusations of corruption , mismanagement , bad loans and even bribes , but more and more Timmerman had begun to attack the structure as a whole , claiming that the laws themselves undermined the national economy through leveraged buyouts financed by unregulated banks , manipulated stock investments using information about paper loans and '
45699	46243	45291	45291	its	1263	' . There were rumours that Timmerman was planning to sue the Spiritual Development Agency for permission to lead an enactment in the Stock Exchange , by the body of Rebecca Rainbow , creator of the modern banking system in the chaos after the Revolution . All this took me some three days to scrape together . I could have spent weeks reading everything , but I just wanted an outline , a silhouette , of Timmerman and his organization . My real target was still the Choir of Angels , and in particular my pet fascination , the Friend lurking in the background , Margaret 23 . And about her , I could get no fix at all . After three days , I found myself slouched in a library chair , my hands jammed into the pockets of my baggy jeans , as I growled at a stack of magazines . What was it Temporary Agency 115 about Tunnel Light ? What was she doing there ? Alison would know something , or at least have the resources for me to find out . I snarled once more at the magazines , and then began gathering them together to return them to their bins . I headed home and booted up the computer . When I was learning to work graphics programs , I taught myself some other tricks as well . Ways of breaking into files , cracking codes , all that good stuff . For a while , it meant hanging around with some extremely obnoxious boys , but once I got the feel of it I could continue on my own . At the time , I told myself it was just something to do , a game , and besides , if some people could do such things , why should n't I be one of them ? Now , watching the screen , I wondered just why investigatory skills had been so important to me . I was about to try some routines , pick my way into a few locked boxes , when I suddenly stopped and stared at the screen . Do n't be paranoid , I scolded myself . No one 's watching you . And besides , you know how to stay anonymous , right ? That is the point , is n't it ? But I still turned off the machine . Two hours later , I had checked into a hotel in midtown , the kind of place Mid - Westerners check into after saving up for their trip to the big city to see some skyscrapers and Broadway musicals . Claiming my cousin was going to join me , I rented two adjoining rooms with a connecting door . After paying cash up front , so I would n't have to use a credit card or my real name , I carried my suitcases up the stairs to the rooms and got to work . The rooms were lousy of course , no view other than the back of an office building and a loud banging from some nearby service room . Young single women have got to be the absolute bottom of the connector pole in the hotel managers '

46472	46478	46462	46462	I	0	' Better paranoid than sorry . '
46668	46781	46667	46667	I	0	'm not sure what it is about computers and gender people , maybe something to do with changing realities . But it 's certainly true that Temporary Agency 117 people like Annie can slide into locked programs the same way they slide from one gender to another . There was something else about Annie - O that made it unforgettable to meet her . She was an enactment master , a woman of power , having led her sisters across gender and spirit barriers over many years . Annie let me apprentice myself to her , and though we both knew I would never really find my way in the virtual worlds ( '
46791	46836	46784	46784	your	1289	' Annie would tell me ) , I did learn enough for operations like breaking into Consumer Liberation . Basically , I set up a dummy program which imitated their own , so that someone who tried to hook into them would get me asking '
46841	46874	46784	46784	your	1289	' and think it was them . Mr Legitimate Caller dutifully typed in the password , at which point I hung up . This brought him back to the real program , asking '
46879	47052	47053	47053	Timmerman	204	' He no doubt assumed he 'd typed wrong the first time , entered the password and thought no more of it . Only now , I knew the magic words as well . Thanks , Annie . Only - there was n't all that much to learn breaking into CL . Oh , if I 'd been some insurance flunky I might have checked out their secret plans for enactments against malpractice fraud . Or I might have run up lists of planned rallies and other trivia . But as for secret goals and agendas , there just did n't seem to be any . Consumer Liberation in private was n't all that different than their public image . The Devoted Ones did not seem to figure much in the daily running of the organization . Everyone appeared grateful for the recognition bestowed on them by the Living World , not least because it impressed the public and drew people to their rallies . But the people who ran the organization , '
47056	47200	47053	47053	Timmerman	204	' , as Spiritweek called them , were all lawyers and cared more about investigations and legal actions than mass blessings . Maggie Tunnel Light hardly existed in CL 's files . In my quick search I found only seven references to her , none of them of any significance . What was she doing there ? She 118 Rachel Pollack did n't work with the Tigers . She appeared to work directly with Timmerman . But how ? Why was she there ? I did confirm one of my intutions . I ran a check on the number of files for particular issues . In the past year , more and more resources had gone into one subject - banking . One of Timmerman 's chief lawyer hot shots , Samuel Jervis , appeared almost obsessed by what he called in a memo '
47211	47297	47053	47053	Timmerman	204	' . While the subject had only crept into Timmerman 's speeches , the Tigers were pursuing it ferociously , gathering and analyzing masses of information , setting up task forces - bank failures , massive loan defaults , overnight millionaires , government coziness with bank directors and corporate raiders . It was n't possible even to begin following it all , other than to get a sense of how maddening it was for the Tigers . Jervis 's most recent memos talked of needing a '
47299	47486	47507	47507	she	236	' , some particular revelation that could get people 's attention long enough to make them see what was happening . Feeling dissatisfied , I backed out of Consumer Liberation 's database . Now for the big guys , I thought . Time to break into the SDA . The Spiritual Development Agency was of a totally different order than Consumer Liberation . No cute dummy program was going to get me SDA passwords . However , I had something better . A phone number . Annie - O and her people considered what they did to be a sacred obligation , opening tunnels between the virtual world and the physical . For Annie , secrets threatened the flow of spirit energy between the worlds , and so they dedicated themselves to cracking open the walls as soon as the government tried to seal them up again . It was n't enough just to break the secrets , they had to share them . They could n't publish them , but they could make them available to anyone whom they 'd invited into their network . I 'm

When I got home I began to clear my desk of all the letters and other junk that had accumulated over the past three days while I was playing investigator . Several times I thought of calling Harry to see if his sharp eye could help me make sense of what was happening . I even rehearsed starting the conversation , something like '
50670	50891	50660	50668	that friend of mine we met in Miracle Park	1337	' But I did n't want to tell him about my electronic b and e , or about Timmerman , let alone how I first came to know Ms Birkett . So I decided instead I should just get to work . I might have dropped the whole thing if not for a visit from the federal government . They were waiting for me in my apartment two days later when I came home from the art supply store on 3rd Avenue . Three of them , two men and a woman . They must have heard me opening the door and stayed silent , because I had no idea anyone was there , until I came round the hallway into my living room / workroom . When I came in , they stood , very politely , as if their mothers had trained them in etiquette , which I suppose was the case , since fed agents supposedly speak of the agency as Mother Truth , and hold fire and mud enactments to bond to Her for life . Temporary Agency 127 Of course , I tried to run as soon as I saw them . This was New York , after all . But one of them , the woman , held up her badge and told me , '

They were wearing masks , though not of animals . These were cylindrical , smooth , with faces painted on a surface that looked like old - fashioned printed circuits . Little lights set into the plastic ( I assumed it was plastic ) flickered on and off in patterns either random or beyond my ability to follow . But then , I was n't in much of a mood for concentrating . Instead of the SDA 's overalls , they wore clothes my Aunt Sylvia might have approved of - brown suits for the men , a knee - length long - sleeved dress with buttons down the front for the woman . Instead of paintings at the crotch , their clothes held mirrors , both there and on their shoes . On the right side of the neck , and on their wrists disappearing up their arms , I could see enactment scars , jagged lines alternating in different directions . Just under the left ear was a brand , something that looked like a simplified version of the badge the woman had shown me . I 'm
51170	51179	51180	51181	the woman	573	' Why do n't we all sit down ? '

They 've got people following her , recording her conversations . I wondered if we would have been safer in her office . On cue , the first man said , '

For a moment I stood there with my hand on the phone , until I noticed a woman behind me shifting her weight from one side to another as she made faces at the air . I sighed and went home . The following night was my date with Joan . As the evening approached , I found myself wishing I could just order in some pizza and keep working . Instead , I told myself it was good for me to see her ( I thought of my mother saying , '
54634	54638	54639	54640	Joan Monteil	196	' and answered her '
54655	54781	54642	54642	I	0	' ) and made myself wash my hair and put on fresh jeans and a black cowgirl shirt with pearl buttonsnaps . And of course I left my glasses off . We all need to keep up our personal traditions . Joan came in bubbling about a dream she 'd had in which the two of us had gone down in separate submarines on some government mission to locate a Stone of Becoming for the president to give to the Emperor of Japan . As soon as she 'd woken up , Joan had rushed to the Canal Street branch of the National Oneiric Registration Agency to run the dream through their computers . She showed me the printout . According to NORA , dreams of '
54794	54819	54497	54497	I	0	' correlated with a high percentage 136 Rachel Pollack of submitted dreams for the previous three - day period from people who described themselves as '
54827	54926	54497	54497	I	0	' . I changed the subject to where we would go for dinner . It was n't just that I 'd never dreamed of Joan , nor even that I could hardly imagine myself doing so . What really made me feel like a creep was the fact that Joan could n't see that I just did n't feel about her the way she felt about me . She made it so easy to use her it became really difficult . I did my best , though . I went out with her for curry , smiling and saying '
54929	55552	55553	55553	I	0	' while she told me about problems with her mother , putting her off as gently as I could when she suggested we go back to the Speaker for an update on the inner truth of our relationship . After an evening of this , I considered that I had earned a good workout in bed . Joan had a way of completely surrendering her body to me , offering herself up as if I was her spirit guide and could draw entry gates all over her body for the Living World to fill her with light . Her openness to me was what I liked best about her , at least sexually - the way she would close her eyes and purr when I kissed her , or moan softly as I moved my tongue and fingertips slowly over her nipples , as if she would be happy for me to do just that for hours and hours , but then , when I would move my fingers down the middle of her body , from the forehead , over the closed eyes and the nose , feeling out the lips and the neck , moving sideways once more over the breasts , when I would move my hand like an animal on a warm mudslide , over the sweat of her vulva and into her lips , she would shriek in a way I never would have thought possible from her . That night I was determined . I was going to make the evening a true landmark for the Revolution . I did pretty well , too , going through three surgical gloves and a good two feet of dental damming clingwrap . Joan did her part as well , surprising me with a gift from Sisters Under Temporary Agency 137 The Skin , a women 's sex shop near the 5th Avenue Teller 's Hall . The gift was a two - part resonating guardian , something I 'd seen but never tried . The rubber - sheathed penetrator was in the shape of a fish - tailed woman with arms folded over her breasts and long hair in waves all the way down her back . The resonator took the form of a bird - headed woman , standing with her chest pushed forward and her arms raised high in an arc . According to the instructions , circuitry in the penetrator picked up the energy of orgasm and broadcast it to its sister who then gave off a voice - like hum , modulating its pitch and volume as the quality of the orgasm changed . I moved the penetrator into Joan without telling her so that she jumped at first , then settled back again , squirming into the mattress as if to get really comfortable , eyes closed , a happy smile on her face . Moving the fish woman in and out at different speeds or at different levels offeree , I discovered I could change the bird song , creating weird melodies and even yelps , perfectly matching Joan 's own ragged cries and shouts . Without realizing it I started singing along , crying out or humming as if there were resonators hidden in my brain and throat . When Joan finished , however , when the bird woman finally stopped even her subliminal whispers , and Joan tried to start on me - I discovered I was n't interested . I did n't want her hands in me , or her lips against my breasts , or any part of what she wanted to give me . I pushed her away as gently as I could , saying something like , '
55554	55575	55576	55576	She	1415	'm sorry , sweetie . I really liked making love to you , but it 's kind of drained me . '

55838	55869	55803	55803	I	0	' But I knew it was n't Joan . I could feel the other side of that door the way the bird lady could feel her fish sister 's ecstasy . '
55874	55999	55872	55872	Alison	174	' I said as I opened the door . She was wearing jeans and running shoes and a black warm - up jacket over a purple T - shirt . Her hair looked wild , as if she 'd been running and had n't had a chance to comb it , and she was n't wearing any makeup or earrings . I realized I 'd always seen her with earrings . Around her neck she wore a brass cylinder on a black silken cord . I guessed that the hollow cylinder contained a statement of spiritual intent along with tiny ceremonial relics of key points in her life and any blessed objects from her own visions and enactments . In other words , protection . '
56005	56083	56086	56086	her	0	' she said . I nodded and stepped away from the door . Alison stood facing me . I expected her to look around , perhaps to comment about how the room reflected who I was , or maybe concealed it . Instead , she just looked at me . I was about to remind her that she was the one who 'd come to see me and maybe she could indicate why , when she said , '
56088	56103	56086	56086	her	0	' My hand flattened against my own protection , still worn around my neck . '
56109	56165	56104	56104	I	0	' I said , though of course I did , I 'd known all along , from the first moment seeing her standing there , behind Timmerman , watching Temporary Agency 139 the crowd while the Happy Twins blessed them into a frenzy . There was a power in this . Bringing us all together . '
56170	56174	56175	56175	She	0	' Alison said . '

56368	56396	56365	56366	Goddamn bastards	1422	' Alison sat down on a wooden chair a few inches away from me . The closeness sent a kind of shock through me . She said , '

56425	56429	56415	56415	she	174	' I said . '

56626	56740	56741	56741	I	0	' I was crying . I could n't decide if I should stop . Alison leaned forward and put her arms around me . I nearly screamed at her , that it was all her fault , why could n't she leave us all alone . But I did n't . Rolling my chair closer , I let her hold me , feeling safer than I 'd ever felt with the SDA , while I cried into her neck . Later , I told Alison that the smartest thing she ever did was not to say anything at that moment . When I told her that , she grinned at me and said , '
56744	57034	56741	56741	I	0	' I cried for about thirty seconds and then started to pull away , but when Alison did n't let go I started to cry again . I thought of the last time she 'd hugged me , after Paul 's death . But I knew this was different . Stopping finally , I dug a tissue from my pants and blew my nose . This time Alison loosened her hold and I sat up . I sat facing her , with my arms still draped around her back . I just kept looking at her , looking at the shape of her face , the placement of her eyes , her nose , her mouth like they were some sort of constellation , the texture of her face some kind of map . Then I bent forward , pulling her close again , and kissed her . It did n't last long , but it had almost twenty years behind it . We separated , then hugged again , not at all like thirteen years ago , and then I took a chance and looked at her . It felt like a chance , as if she might look at me in some wrong way and ruin everything and I would have to hate her again . But she only sat very still , her arms around me , her face solemn , the eyes glistening as if she too might start to cry . I had the awful thought that she might apologize again , or tell me she did n't want to take advantage of me . When she spoke , however , it was only after her Temporary Agency 141 face changed to a smile . '
57041	57055	57056	57056	She	1430	' she said . I shrugged . They got all dirty from crying . '
57059	57068	57069	57069	she	1430	' Can we go sit on the couch ? '
57182	57190	57191	57191	She	1430	' I want to go after them . '
57194	57216	57191	57191	She	1430	' Yes . I know . You realize we might not get them ? This is the government , after all . '
57217	57232	57233	57233	Alison	174	' I understand that . I just want to try . At least that . '
57236	57269	57233	57233	Alison	174	' This is hard for me , Ellen . I have to let go of feeling responsible for you . Feeling . . . feeling that I lured you into a trap . '
57270	57276	57277	57277	She	1430	' Using yourself as bait ? '
57288	57293	57294	57294	she	1430	' I suppose so , '
57297	57312	57294	57294	she	1430	' Or maybe I used you as bait for yourself . And for me . '

57366	57372	57373	57373	she	1430	' I do n't refuse , '

57566	57635	57518	57518	she	1430	' she said . She bent her head down with her eyes closed and pressed her hands against her thighs . At first I thought she was angry , but then I realized she was separating herself from me , making sure that the answer she gave did n't come from desire . I was wondering if I should put my glasses back on when she looked up . '
57639	57643	57518	57518	she	1430	' she said . '

57813	58322	57806	57807	the Saved	250	' I told her . She held out her hands , palms up . I went past them , into her arms . If I 'd had my glasses on , I would have tossed them away . How do you start a love affair with someone you 've been in love with for most of your life ? How do you begin when you did n't even meet her for the first five years you loved her , when for another four you could n't admit that such a feeling could live in you , and then for the next ten you tried to drive it out entirely ? What do you say , what do you do , when you find out that she 's in love with you ? Do you forget all this history and pretend you 've just met ? Do you thank - someone ( we could n't thank the Benign Ones , not any more , so whom ? ) for twisting the world to grant your life 's yearning ? Do you wonder if she 's tricked you , if she set this whole thing up , all those years ago ? Do you wonder if you 've set her up ? If you do n't know who to thank , who do you blame ? I realized , that first night Alison and I spent together , that I actually knew almost nothing about her . I could still run down a list of her most famous cases , at least the ones up until thirteen years ago . And I knew the shape of her face , the curl of her hair , the movement of her hands , her shoulders , her head as she spoke , the way she leaned forward when excited , or rocked back slightly when thinking , or especially calculating . But I did n't know about her growing up , or what she did when she was hanging out with her friends , or who those friends were , if she went to professional parties with lawyers or played softball with a group of women 144 Rachel Pollack she 'd known from her high school menstrual initiation classes . The crescent initiation scar on her left wrist - I remembered seeing it years ago , but I did n't know how she got it . She had a tattoo as well , on her left hip , a blindfolded woman dancing on a purple flower . Where did she get it ? Why ? How long had she had it ? Did it come from her bar enactment when she became a lawyer ? Or something I knew nothing about ? Maybe she 'd gone skiing once and got caught in an avalanche , and after the dogs found her and the mountain crews nursed her back to health she inscribed the tattoo in a ceremony of recognition . I could have asked her ; she would have told me , I 'm
58515	58521	58512	58512	she	1442	' lived together for a while '
58771	58774	58756	58756	she	174	' turned out '

59211	59222	59223	59223	She	174	' I would like to do an enactment with you . '
59587	59590	59610	59610	she	174	' Ellen alone '
59605	59609	59610	59610	she	174	' All right , '
59850	59963	59849	59849	I	0	'm sure she 'd have approved of me putting them safely in a chest - but not ripped to pieces . With the rope I set out the lines of a true ground on the floor , careful to keep it curved at all points for the female body . Within this field I laid down a silk scarf , golden and turquoise , for the Sun and the Sea , the light of knowledge shining on the sullen mysteries of the soul . Broken pieces of chains held down the silk , a sign of liberation for Chained Mother , held prisoner at the bottom of the ocean . Next came a '
59966	60414	60455	60455	she	1484	' , a metal pole 148 Rachel Pollack I 'd made , with branches hung with downward pointing triangles . The triangles were made of red velvet on wire frames , decorated with yellow and indigo ribbons . In the centre the largest triangle was a double layer of black velvet , with a space between the layers for a small revolving light and a tape loop . The light shone through a gauzy red vertical strip down the centre of the triangle . On the outside of this strip I 'd pasted folds of pink satin to suggest labia . The tape loop , set up on a miniaturized cassette player ( another boon from Radio Temple ) , consisted of women moaning in soft joy . A single wire fed electricity to both the light and the tape . The wire plugged into one of two sockets in the apartment officially sanctified to receive sacred current . So I guess I could n't escape SDA involvement after all . When I turned on the tape and the light Alison grinned at me . I could see she wanted to say something , or maybe even do something inspired by the moaning triangle , but she kept silent , allowing me to go ahead . There were several other things to set out , including a small fan which plugged into the other half of the sacred socket . I 'd painted the four blades of the fan with dots , concentric circles , mouths and my handprint . Before I set it going I asked Alison to dip her hand in the black paste and place her print over mine . When I turned on the switch the blades moved around slowly , just enough to billow the cloth . The final participants did n't come from the box , but from my shelf of permanent house guardians above the regular altar . These were three clay statues , rough images of women I 'd made from mud collected after a storm on a song journey I 'd made in the Adirondack mountains shortly after I left college . I 'd painted them in thick globs of paste , one yellow , one red and one black . I set them on the floor in a row , but when I straightened up Alison bent down before the guardians to remove the protection from around her neck and slip it over the head of the one in the middle , the black . I touched her shoulder and looked Temporary Agency 149 at her as she stood up . I think I was crying , I 'm

In gratitude , I stopped myself from asking if he 'd framed any pictures of her from Time magazine . When Alison had thanked him and shown her interest in his work by citing a couple of his lesser - known triumphs , he turned to me , said how pleased he was to meet me and asked if I was part of Ms Birkett 's firm . I disappointed him , and Alison added that '
61516	61710	61509	61509	I	0	' Alison laid it out for him , only leaving out her personal connection to Jack Chikowsky , the way we 'd found out about Margaret Light - at - the - End - of - the - Tunnel 23 's connection to Arthur Channing and our knowledge of her previous incarnation . We 'd discussed that last point for some time , wondering if we might need it to shock Timmerman into recognizing that he was being set up . Finally , we decided that it raised too many issues of our own involvement . Timmerman listened carefully , sometimes with his head down , sometimes looking sharply at Alison or me . Pretty soon it became clear that he did not want to hear what we were telling him . When Alison told him about Jack , and about the other incidents , he nodded and said how tragic that was and how he 'd asked the Twins ( he did n't call them that ) to channel their blessings into more gentle manifestations . When we suggested that these events suggested some sort of conspiracy , he smiled and asked , '
61723	61783	61722	61722	I	0	'm very sorry if occasionally some people have had trouble handling their own joy , but I find it hard to accept that an ecstatic blessing can be a plot . If anything , the problems simply show how much people need the experience , so that it would not come as such a shock to their starved systems . '
61826	61954	61820	61820	people	302	' We had to do some dodging of our own , for Timmerman seemed more concerned about what we knew about the banking issue than any of the subjects we wanted to raise . For a while , he and Alison danced around each other , struggling over whose agenda would dominate the discussion - his to find out what we knew of Channing 's banking connections , Alison 's to focus on the Being summoned by Carolyn Park - Wu . After a few minutes , Alison convinced him that we had not concerned ourselves with the details of his investigations , only the fact that he clearly was on to something , and that it was Arthur Channing who had sent Tunnel Light to him .

With her heavily made up eyes , her pale skin and black hair , she looked much the same as she had in Miracle Park , except that she wore no lipstick and this time she was all in white , a shapeless tunic over straight - legged white pants . Only her sandals were coloured , the same shade of soft green as the office carpet , giving her a look of some albino flower rising from the grass . '

And then again . Her hair had a kind of matted overstyled look , yet disorganized , as if there too she could n't seem to decide and just kept adding more and more gel , or spray , every time she decided to change it . As she talked , she moved around the apartment in a nervous dance , even pirouetting , with movements that tried to be graceful or provocative , but ended up as too abrupt , off balance . She had a habit of moving her fingers on her body , down her cheek , or along her thigh . She was dressed all in black , wearing stretch jeans and a T - shirt . I could only watch , confused and a little frightened . Now and then , she would come towards me , leaning forward , or putting out a hand to stroke my face .

That was when I realized what she reminded me of . The people at Alexander Timmerman 's rally , the ones who 'd received the blessing and could n't stop touching things .

70296	70732	70294	70295	the visitors	1649	' gallery above the trading floor , looking down through the thick glass , I was struck most by how crowded the stock market was . Not just the people , some of whom were frantically making deals and filling quotas in the final minutes before Timmerman and his entourage would enter , others of whom had given up all thought of business as they milled around , telling jokes , pounding drums covered in bills , eating sandwiches , or just standing alone or in groups , looking up towards Rebecca Rainbow 's body , suspended in her glass coffin above the business floor , or else towards the dark red bell in its glass cage , also high above the floor against the back wall . Beyond the dense and nervous crowd , equipment filled the room - clusters of phones on poles or in banks , spiritual supply posts where traders could find flash powder , paper enactment robes , representation dolls and other SDA - approved paraphernalia for last - minute help on some important deal , and especially the trading posts themselves . There was something very animal - like about the trading posts . In the centre of each stood a huge dark box , painted over with spirit emblems for prosperity and containing the computer circuitry that linked all the deals . Thick poles containing cables rose from these boxes to join a maze of latticework just below the gold - embossed ceiling . Artbirds hung on thin wires from the latticework , a whole flock 174 Rachel Pollack of the life - like bright birds , their voice circuits set for songs of wealth and harmony . Timmerman had wanted to set loose genuine pigeons so that Rainbow might speak through them but , according to Alison 's contacts , the SDA refused to disrupt the calculated songs of the artbirds . From the central cable box , each trading post opened out in a figure eight of counterspace where the actual work got done . The counters too were packed with people and equipment . Above the counters double banks of video screens showed the various transactions . Smaller video monitors hung just over the heads of the crowd on the ends of metal poles which extended out and downwards from the larger videos . The poles looked like legs , giving the dozen or so trading posts the appearance of giant insects swarming over the floor , about to attack the humans , small and vulnerable beneath them . Above it all , in the visitors '

In the lobby as well , I 'd just stood there , with my official visitor 's pass crunched in my hand , wondering what the point of my watching was if I could n't do anything , and why did n't I just go home , and what would Alison say if I could n't face it . Finally , I told myself it was only the third floor , it would n't take more than ten seconds . I waited until the car had filled up , then slipped in before the door closed . The last time I 'd ridden in an elevator , the day I 'd decided that I would keep healthier if I just took the stairs everywhere , the building super - it was Harry 's apartment building , actually - had let the husk - Paul 's husk - run down . The nylon '
71264	71316	71319	71320	my cousin	273	' had mostly fallen off , the eye dots had rubbed out and kids had covered the pole itself with their own gang enactment signs . I remember how I 'd wanted to trap that goddamn super in the elevator and bang his head against the door and scream at him , '
71322	71396	71319	71320	my cousin	273	' Instead , I 'd just stopped riding in elevators . Now , when I saw the polished steel , the actual jewels used for eyes , what looked like real human hair , I could n't decide if I was relieved or more enraged . Instead , I looked away , unable to let him see me . And then it was over and I was upstairs by the lobby outside the visitors '

We could only hear a secondary transmission of the Choir of Angels . But it was enough to bring some people rubbing up against the glass barrier , even pounding on it , as if they would smash through and leap down to where they could get the undiluted blessing . Others caressed each other or else the loudspeakers carrying up the noise from the trading floor . Somebody - some guy in a baseball jacket - began to caress my shoulder . I shoved him , or maybe hit him , much harder than I intended as I shouted , '

73871	74339	73865	73865	them	1770	' but I knew it was no use . 182 Rachel Pollack And down below , in the pit , Timmerman was realizing the same thing . The wolfmen and the mud people were gone , melted into the mob , but no one was bothering Timmerman . He was standing on his makeshift podium , the microphone still in his hand , but now forgotten as he looked from side to side . Before him , his Friends were still singing in their strange needle - thin voices . Timmerman looked like he wanted to stop them yet did n't dare . Or know how . The broadcast cameras , which had been trained on Timmerman , had all turned now , panning the floor or focusing on some particular person or group . A lot of people had stripped off their clothes , or torn them , some leaving only shredded rags , though curiously the clerks , brokers , reporters and pages had mostly kept on their red , yellow , blue and turquoise jackets . And curiously , there was very little actual screwing going on , as if that would only narrow people 's choices and how could they stand to restrict themselves ? They were sliding up and down each other 's bodies or even rubbing along the floor , they were climbing the insect arms to slam up against the much larger monitors which formed the insect bodies , laughing as they fell off against the floor , the counter , other bodies . Just as in Miracle Park , I could see that three - year - old innocence in the way people moved against each other and every object they could reach . They were laughing all the time , even when they were moaning or shouting . Someone who had cut himself , probably on a monitor , lay twisting on the floor , offering his blood to whoever desired it . A whole pack of people kneeled or crouched over his body , while others tried to rub against him , but none of them looked at all aggressive or predatory . Just children playing . Was I wrong ? Even if Timmerman would suffer , would no one else get hurt ? Was I just a hypocrite ? Had n't I just spent the night with a woman old enough to be , well , not my mother , but at least my aunt ? Near me , the man who Temporary Agency 183 had grabbed me was kissing the woman in the doll jacket . Why should n't they do that ? I felt suddenly like one of those people who stand on street corners wearing three overcoats and shouting about purifying the Revolution of '
74343	74698	74741	74741	Someone	384	' whatever that is . I shook my head , forcing myself to remember what Alison had told me about her friend Jack , or the other people , cut or trampled . To remember Joan . And yet , something in me kept insisting that I was the one who was wrong , or twisted , that I could n't just join in with everybody else . Maybe what happened to Joan was my fault . If I had n't rejected her that night we could have broken through the barriers that make love run down , that make orgasms dwindle to a flicker which blows out at the slightest distraction . We could have invited Harry , Alison , anyone we wanted , to feast with us , eating the food Margaret Tunnel Light was offering us . Instead , Joan ended up in the hospital . And here I was again , refusing , refusing . A prickliness seized my skin , a jabbing all over my body that both hurt and excited me . I could see everything happening on the floor , small details in different places , all at the same time . At one trading station , people were pulling the machines apart , ripping the phones out and rubbing the electronic pieces all over their bodies , cutting themselves or burning their skin . Two women stood in torn clothes , taking turns clawing each other up and down their bodies , using a silver hand with the fingers extended . I was right , I told myself . This is what I knew would happen . Me and Arthur Channing . What we knew that Margaret Tunnel Light did n't . But I could n't make myself move or do anything , I just stood and watched . Watched as people grabbed the ceremonial oversized pens , the black lacquer and gold ones used for signing contracts , and jammed them into every hole in their bodies , or else stabbed themselves and each other with the gold points , 184 Rachel Pollack injecting sanctified traders '

Finally , I remembered Adrienne Birth - of - Beauty 's Fifteenth Proposition - '

77826	78124	77824	77824	me	0	' I said . Alison spat into the ashes from the fire , then scooped up a small amount to mix into the paste with more spit . She held up her left forefinger and kissed it , looking at me as we both remembered how that finger had lifted my whole body early in the morning , before she 'd gotten back on the phones and I 'd left her to go to the disaster . Eyes closed , I let her paint an enactment face on me , the lines and concentric circles a summary of both our lives - initiation markings , family scar designs we 'd shown each other , words of power from our deep journeys , images from the screen we 'd painted on our first night together . When she 'd finished , I reached into my bag for the amulet the SDA had given me as well as a small glass pot containing dried menstrual blood from my first period . With Annie 's hammer I smashed the amulet , then used the pieces to form a small circle inside the larger one . Using the powdered blood my left middle finger drew two stick figures , one outside the outer circle , the other in the centre , with a line running between them . When we 'd planned the Summoning , Alison and I had spent half an hour deciding what designation we should use for our target . What name would reach her ? Finally , Alison convinced me that for a Bright Being , as for Temporary Agency 193 humanity , reality consisted of whatever identity she was inhabiting right now . My finger wrote Margaret Tunnel Light 's name in menstrual blood and spit . '

An agency for Malignant Ones who worked for the government . Paul worked there . In that building . And you ate him . Why wo n't you remember ? '
78847	78866	78844	78844	her	1858	' No . This is your sickness . False stories about me will not help you , Ellen . '

She moved her fingers around my cheeks , my ears , underneath my jaw , and then held them for a while on the side of my neck . She dropped her arms finally and stepped back . '

79195	79259	79260	79261	Ellen Pierson	158	' Down the hall an elevator door had opened and now three men in tubular masks were moving towards us . Two of the men held guns , the third carried a spray gun attached by hose to a heavy canister covered in markings and tied round with sanctified nylon cord hung with beads . Demon breaker . One of the men said , '
79267	79278	79266	79266	you	1863	're under arrest . Turn around and face the wall . '

I stood up and took Alison 's hand . The Being straightened . She closed her eyes a moment , then opened them again , her face calm . Turning to me , she said , '
79997	80005	80006	80006	Paul	264	' I glanced at Alison who nodded . '
80008	80027	80006	80006	Paul	264	' I said . The elevator moved . When we touched the ground floor , Tunnel Light said , '
80035	80543	80006	80006	Paul	264	' It took us a moment to realize what she meant , but when the door opened Alison and I had safely pressed our eyes into each other 's shoulders as a flash of light filled the corridor . When we stepped out of the elevator five or six men and women were on the ground , groaning or pulling off their tube masks to press their hands against their eyes . Ignoring them , we followed Tunnel Light , who had already moved through the lobby and onto the trading floor . You 've probably seen something of what Alison and I found when we entered that room . For those who did n't catch it on live television , the news programmes made sure to run the tapes several hundred times ( with men in suits giving sombre warnings beforehand about the disturbing footage ) . But even if you saw the unedited live version , the bleeding bodies , the vomit and shit , the torn arms and ripped - open chests , the people naked or wearing layers of clothes , the people sitting and staring , the ones wandering or falling down , the cut and the dead , the ones lying face down on the floor , and all around them the smashed computers , the ripped - out wires and 198 Rachel Pollack telephones , even if you saw all of it , the screen could never show what it was like to step into it . To climb over the bodies and feel limp hands brush against our legs , to step between the dead and the staring , watching out for live wires and glass and pieces of bodies . And the silence , the absence of any human noise , not even moans or weeping , so that the only things we could hear were the whisper of the cameras and the slight background hum of the loudspeakers , along with the cheerful whistle of the artbirds , still fluttering around Rebecca Rainbow 's impassive body . And the smell , that battering ram hit of emptied - out bodies , of come and blood and vomit , all mingled with burnt rubber and plastic , overlaid at the same time with a cloud of perfume , a smell of flowers as delicate as the song of the birds . We did n't go very far into the room . Harry and Glorybe told us later that one of the cameras focused on us for just a moment , but I never saw it on any of the broadcasts ( though to be fair , I watched very few of them ) . We picked our way through the bodies for a few yards until we just stopped , holding hands and staring all around . The Happy Twins were gone , along with Timmerman and his mudpeople . But Margaret 23 was there , in the middle of the room . She turned and saw us . '
80547	80555	80006	80006	Paul	264	' she said . This is finished . '
80728	80955	80724	80724	We	1891	' Our hands dropped to our sides , then once more found each other and we stepped through the bodies broken by ecstasy into each other 's arms . 8 The lobby of Paul 's old office building looked pretty much like it had on that last day , thirteen years ago , the dark wood panels , the brass knobs and fittings , the tiles with their soft colours filling the floor . For a while , I just stood there , staring down at the mosaic of the Army of the Saints , as if the Founders somehow could liberate me the way they 'd liberated New Chicago . Finally , I just shrugged and stepped up to the row of elevators . On the way over , I 'd wondered if I 'd remember which one it was . Now , there was no question in my mind . Not that it mattered , for before I could even press the button the correct door slid open . He was waiting for me . I took a look around to make sure no one was following me , but it was Saturday and the lobby was empty save for a few tourists who just wanted to photograph the floor . As soon as I stepped inside , the door slid shut behind me . '
80960	81009	80958	80958	Paul	264	' I said . The steel column shone for a moment and I ran my hand along it . It was a pretty nice one , not quite so extravagant as the one in the Stock Exchange , but polished , with real hair or a decent imitation . '
81016	81045	80958	80958	Paul	264	' I said . The elevator rose so smoothly I could hardly detect the movement or just when it stopped , but I assumed we were between floors . '

81064	81098	81063	81063	I	0	'm sorry . For staying away so long . It 's just . . . it 's just Temporary Agency 201 that it 's taken me a long time to understand some things . '

81228	81266	81221	81221	I	0	' You know , I tried really hard to blame Alison . And if not her , then me . Or the government . Or the Living World . But I kept leaving someone out . You . '
81278	81352	81277	81277	I	0	'm trying to say is , I wanted to see you as a victim . But I understand now , Paul . No one forced you into this elevator . You saw the snakes as clearly as I did . You were making a choice . Lisa Black Dust 7 had given you a taste of something and you decided you just did n't want to give it up . Oh , Paul . '
81391	81443	81388	81388	I	0	' I love you , Paul . You made a choice . Desire over safety . I wish you had n't . But I 've just got to accept that you did what you wanted to do . And that 's okay . It has to be . I love you . '
