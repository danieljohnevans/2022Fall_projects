27378	27428	27241	27244	A figure like that	1659	" Looking up , he saw that , on the contrary , the sky is like the veils which a thousand Madonnas have let fall from their hair ; and the grass fleets and darkens like a flight of girls fleeing the embraces of hairy satyrs from enchanted woods . "
27433	27450	27241	27244	A figure like that	1659	" he said ( for he had fallen into the bad habit of speaking aloud ) , "
27468	27815	27816	27816	I	0	" And he despaired of being able to solve the problem of what poetry is and what truth is and fell into a deep dejection . And here we may profit by a pause in his soliloquy to reflect how odd it was to see Orlando stretched , there on his elbow on a June day and to reflect that this fine fellow with all his faculties about him and a healthy body , witness cheeks and limbs - a man who never thought twice about heading a charge or fighting a duel - should be so subject to the lethargy of thought , and rendered so susceptible by it , that when it came to a question of poetry , or his own competence in it , he was as shy as a little girl behind her mother 's cottage door . In our belief , Greene 's ridicule of his tragedy hurt him as much as the Princess ' ridicule of his love . But to returnOrlando went on thinking . He kept looking at the grass and at the sky and trying to bethink him what a true poet , who has his verses published in London , would I02 ORLANDO say about them . Memory , meanwhile ( whose habits have already been described ) kept steady before his eyes the face of Nicholas Greene , as if that sardonic looselipped man , treacherous as he had proved himself , were the Muse in person , and it was to him that Orlando must do homage . So Orlando , that summer morning , offered him a variety of phrases , some plain , others figured , and Nick Greene kept shaking his head and sneering and muttering something about Glawr and Cicero and the death of poetry in our time . At length , starting to his feet ( it was now winter and very cold ) Orlando swore one of the most remarkable oaths of his lifetime , for it bound him to a servitude than which none is stricter . "

27866	28057	27816	27816	I	0	" ; and here he made as if he were tearing a whole budget of papers across and tossing them in the face of that sneering loose - lipped man . Upon which , as a cur ducks if you stoop to shy a stone at him , Memory ducked her effigy of Nick Greene out of sight ; and substituted for it - nothing whatever . But Orlando , all the same , went on thinking . He had indeed much to think of . For when he tore the parchment across , he tore , in one rending , the scrolloping , emblazoned scroll which he had made out in his own 103 ORLANDO favour in the solitude of his room appointing himself , as the King appoints Ambassadors , the first poet of his race , the first writer of his age , conferring eternal immortality upon his soul and granting his body a grave among laurels and the intangible banners of a people 's reverence perpetually . Eloquent as this all was , he now tore it up and threw it in the dust - bin . "
28060	28064	27816	27816	I	0	" he said , "
28067	28100	27816	27816	I	0	" ( and since there was no Nick Greene to stop him , he went on to revel in images of which we will choose only one or two of the quietest ) "
28127	28401	29240	29241	King Jamie	273	" etc . , etc . The pith of his phrases was that yhjjil m i m .. pedes and constricts , obscurity wras about aaaanike ... amisthsCurfity is dark , ample and free ; obscurity lets the mind take its way unimpeded . Over the obscure man is poured the merciful suffusion of darkness . None knows where he goes or comes . He may seek the truth and speak it ; he alone is free ; he alone is truthful ; he alone is at peace . And so he sank into a quiet mood , under the oak tree , the hardness of whose roots , exposed above the ground , seemed to him rather comfortable than otherwise . Sunk for a long time in profound thoughts as to the value of obscurity , and the delight of having no name , but being like a wave which returns to the deep body of I04 ORLA ND O the sea ; thinking how obscurity rids the mind of the irk of envy and spite ; how it sets running in the veins the free waters of generosity and magnanimity ; and allows giving and taking without thanks offered or praise given ; which must have . been the way of all great poets , he supposed ( though his knowledge of Greek was not enough to bear him out ) for , he thought , Shakespeare must have written like that , and the church builders built like that , anonymously , needing no thanking or naming , but only their work in the daytime and a little ale perhaps at night-"What
28408	28421	29240	29241	King Jamie	273	" he thought , stretching his limbs out under the oak tree . "
28432	29236	29240	29241	King Jamie	273	" The thought struck him like a bullet . Ambition dropped like a plummet . Rid of the heart - burn of rejected love , and of vanity rebuked , and all the other stings and pricks which the nettle - bed of life had burnt upon him when ambitious of fame , but could no longer inflict upon one careless of glory , he opened his eyes , which had been wide open all the time , but had seen only thoughts , and saw , lying in the hollow beneath him , his house . There it lay in the early sunshine of spring . It looked a town rather than a house , but a town built , not hither and thither , as this man wished or that , but circumspectly , by a single architect with one idea in his head . Courts and buildings , grey , red , plum colour , lay orderly 105 ORLANDO and symmetrical ; the courts were some of them oblong and some square ; in this was a fountain ; in that a statue ; the buildings were some of them low , some pointed ; here was a chapel , there a belfry ; spaces of the greenest grass lay in between and clumps of cedar trees and beds of bright flowers ; all were clasped - yet so well set out was it that it seemed that every part had room to spread itself fittingly - by the roll of a massive wall ; while smoke from innumerable chimneys curled perpetually into the air . This vast , yet ordered building , which could house a thousand men and perhaps two thousand horses was built , Orlando thought , by workmen whose names are unknown . Here , have lived for more centuries than I can count , the obscure generations of my own obscure family . Not one of these Richards , Johns , Annes , Elizabeths has left a token of himself behind him , yet all , working together with their spades and their needles , their love - making and their child - bearing , have.left this . Never had the house looked more noble and humane . Why , then , had he wished to raise himself above them ? For it seemed vain and arrogant in the extreme to try to better that anonymous work of creation ; the labours of those vanished hands . Better was it to go unknown and.leave behind you an arch , a potting shed , a wall where peaches ripen , than to burn like a meteor and io6 ORLANDO leave no dust . For after all , he said , kindling as he looked at the great house on the greensward below , the unknown lords and ladies who lived there never forgot to set aside something for those who come after ; for the roof that will leak ; for the tree that will fall . There was always a warm corner for the old shepherd in the kitchen ; always food for the hungry ; always their goblets were polished , though they lay sick ; and the windows were lit though they were dying . Lords though they were , they were content to go down into obscurity with the molecatcher and the stone - mason . Obscure noblemen , forgotten builders - thus he apostrophised them with a warmth that entirely gainsaid such critics as called him cold , indifferent , slothful ( the truth being that a quality often lies just on the other side of the wall from where we seek it)- thus he apostrophised his house and race in terms of the most moving eloquence ; but when it came to the peroration - and what is eloquence that lacks a peroration?-he fumbled . He would have liked to have ended with a flourish to the effect that he would follow in their footsteps and add another stone to their building . Since , however , the building already covered nine acres , to add even a single stone seemed superfluous . Could one mention furniture in a peroration ? Could one speak of chairs and tables and mats to lie beside people 's beds ? For whatever the peroration I07 ORLANDO wanted that was what the house stood in need of . Leaving his speech unfinished for the moment , he strode down hill again resolved henceforward to devote himself to the furnishing of the mansion . The news - that she was to attend him instantly - brought tears to the eyes of good old Mrs. Grimsditch , now grown somewhat old . Together they perambulated the house . The towel horse in the King 's bedroom ( "
29246	29514	29240	29241	King Jamie	273	" she said , hinting that it was many a day since a King had slept under their roof ; but the odious Parliament days were over and there was now a Crown in England again ) lacked a leg ; there were no stands to the ewers in the little closet leading into the waiting room of the Duchess 's page ; Mr. Greene had made a stain on the carpet with his nasty pipe smoking , which she and Judy , for all their scrubbing , had never been able to wash out . Indeed , when Orlando came to reckon up the matter of furnishing with rosewood chairs and cedar wood cabinets , with silver basins , china bowls , and Persian carpets every one of the three hundred and sixty - five bedrooms which the house contained , he saw that it would be no light one ; and if some thousands of pounds of his estate remained over , these would do little more than hang a few galleries with tapestry , set the dining hall with fine , carved chairs and provide mirrors of solid silver and chairs of the same io8 ORLANDO metal ( for which he had an inordinate passion ) for the furnishing of the royal bed chambers . He now set to work in earnest , as we can prove beyond a doubt if we look at his ledgers . Let us glance at an inventory of what he bought at this time , with the expenses totted up in the margin - but these we omit . "
29544	29563	29240	29241	King Jamie	273	" To seventy yellow satin chairs and sixty stools , suitable with their buckram covers to them all ... "
29572	29586	29240	29241	King Jamie	273	" To seventeen dozen boxes containing each dozen five dozen of Venice glasses ... "
29599	29623	29240	29241	King Jamie	273	" To ninety - seven cushions of crimson damask laid with silver parchment lace and footstools of cloth of tissue and chairs suitable ... "
29633	30575	29240	29241	King Jamie	273	" Already - it is an effect lists have upon us - we are beginning to yawn . But if we stop , it is only that the catalogue is tedious , not that it is finished . There are twenty - nine pages more of it and the total sum disbursed I09 ORLANDO ran into many thousands - that is to say millions of our money . And if his day was spent like this , at night again , Lord Orlando might be found reckoning . out what . it would cost to level a million molehills , if the men were paid tenpence an hour ; and again , how many hundredweight of nails at 5 Y. d a gill were needed to repair the fence round the park , which was fifteen miles in cir// cumference . And so on and so on . The tale , we say , is tedious , for one cupboard is much like another , and one molehill not much different.from a million . Some pleasant journeys it cost him ; and some fine adventures . As , for instance , when he set a whole city of blind women near Bruges to stitch hangings for a silver canopied bed ; and the story of his adventure with a Moor in Venice of whom he bought ( but only at the sword 's point ) his lacquered cabinet , might , in other hands , prove worth the telling . Nor did the work lack variety ; for here would come , drawn by teams from Sussex , great trees , to be sawn across and laid along the gallery for flooring ; and then a great chest from Persia , stuffed with wool and saw - dust , from which , at last , he would take a single plate , or one topaz ring . At length , however , there was no room in the galleries for another table ; no room on the tables for another cabinet ; no room in the cabinet for another rose - bowl ; no room in the bowl for another handful of potpourri ; there IIO OR LA ND O was no room for anything anywhere ; in short the - house was furnished . In the garden snowdrops , crocuses , hyacinths , magnolias , roses , lilies , asters , the dahlia in all its varieties , pear trees and apple trees and cherry trees and mulberry trees with an enormous quantity of rare and flowering shrubs , of trees evergreen and perennial , grew so thick on each other 's roots that there was no plot of earth without its bloom , and no stretch of sward without its shade . In addition , he had imported wild fowl with gay plumage ; and two Malay bears , the surliness of whose manners concealed , he was certain , trusty hearts . All now was ready ; and when it was evening and the innumerable silver sconces were lit and the light airs which for ever moved about the galleries stirred the blue and green arras , so that it looked as if the huntsmen were riding and Daphne were flying ; when the silver shone and lacquer glowed and wood kindled ; when the carved chairs held their arms out and dolphins swam upon the walls with mermaids on their backs ; when all this and much more than all this was complete and to his liking , Orlando walked through the house with his elk hounds following and felt content . He had matter now , he thought , to fill out his peroration . Perhaps it would be well to begin the speech all over again . Yet , as he paraded the galleries he felt that still something was lacking . Chairs and tables , however richly gilt and carved , sofas , III ORLANDO resting on lions ' paws with swans ' necks curving under them , beds even of the softest swansdown are not by themselves enough . People sitting in them , people lying in them improve them amazingly . Accordingly Orlando now began a series of very splendid entertainments to the nobility and gentry of the neighbourhood . The three hundred and sixty - five bedrooms were full for a month at a time . Guests jostled each other on the fifty - two staircases . Three hundred servants bustled about the pantries . Banquets took place almost nightly . Thus , in a very few years , Orlando had worn the nap off his velvet , and spent the half of his fortune ; but he had earned the good opinion of his neighbours , held a score of offices in the county , and was annually presented with perhaps a dozen volumes dedicated to his Lordship in rather fulsome terms by grateful poets . For though he was careful not to consort with writers at that time and kept himself always aloof from ladies of foreign blood , still , he was excessively generous both to women and to poets , and both adored him . But when the feasting was at its height and his guests were at their revels , he was apt to take himself off to his private room alone . There when the door was shut , and he was certain of privacy , he would have out an old writing book , stitched together with silk stolen from his mother 's workbox , and labelled in a round schoolboy 112 ORLANDO hand , "
30583	30758	29240	29241	King Jamie	273	" In this he would write till midnight chimed and long after . But as he scratched out as many lines as he wrote in , the sum of them was often , at the end of the year , rather less than at the beginning , and it looked as if in the process of writing the poem would be completely unwritten . For it is for the historian of letters to remark that he had changed his style amazingly . His floridity was chastened ; his abundance curbed ; the age of prose was congealing those warm fountains . The very landscape outside was less stuck about with garlands and the briars themselves were less thornied and intricate . Perhaps the senses were a little duller and honey and cream less seductive to the palate . Also that the streets were better drained and the houses better lit had its effect upon the style , it can not be doubted . One day he was adding a line or two with enormous labour to"The
30763	30860	30861	30861	ORLANDO	259	Poem"'when a shadow crossed the tail of his eye . It was no shadow , he soon saw , but the figure of a very tall lady in riding hood and mantle crossing the quadrangle on which his room looked out . As this was the most private of the courts , and the lady was a stranger to him , Orlando marvelled how she had got there . Three days later the same apparition appeared again ; and on Wednesday noon appeared once more . This time , Orlando was determined to follow her , nor x"3
31179	32359	32363	32363	he	1675	" , ORLANDO taken lodging over a baker 's shop at the Park Gates . She had seen his picture and it was the image of a sister of hers who was - here she guffawed - long since dead . She was visiting the English Court . The Queen was her cousin . The King was a very good fellow but seldom went to bed sober . Here she tee - heed and haw - hawed again . In short , there was nothing for it but to ask her in and give her a glass of wine . Indoors , her manners regained the hauteur natural to a Roumanian Archduchess ; and had she not shown a knowledge of wines rare in a lady , and made some observations upon firearms and the customs of sportsmen in her country , which were sensible enough , the talk would have lacked spontaneity . Jumping to her feet at last , she announced that she would call the following day , swept another prodigious curtsey and departed . The following day , Orlando rode out . The next , he turned his back ; on the third he drew his curtain . On the fourth it rained , and as he could not keep a lady in the wet , nor was altogether averse to company , he invited her in and asked her opinion whether a suit of armour , which belonged to an ancestor of his , was the work of Jacobi or of Topp . He inclined to Topp . She held another opinion - it matters very little which . But it is of some importance to the course of our story that , in illustrating her argument , which had to do with the working of the tie pieces , the I 5 ORLANDO Archduchess Harriet took the golden shin case and fitted it to Orlando 's leg . That he had a pair of the shapeliest legs that any Nobleman has ever stood upright upon has already been said . Perhaps something in the way she fastened the ankle buckle ; or her stooping posture ; or Orlando 's long seclusion ; or the natural sympathy which is between the sexes ; or the Burgundy ; or the fire - any of these causes may have been to blame ; for certainly blame there is on one side or another , when a Nobleman of Orlando 's breeding , entertaining a lady in , his house , and she his elder by many years , with a face a yard long and staring eyes , dressed somewhat ridiculously too , in a mantle and riding cloak though the season was warm - blame there is when such a Nobleman is so suddenly and violently overcome by passion of some sort that he has to leave the room . But what sort of passion , it may well be asked , could this be ? And the answer is double - faced as Love herself . For Love - but leaving Love out of the argument for a moment , the actual event was this : When the Archduchess Harriet Griselda stooped to fasten the buckle , Orlando heard , suddenly and unaccountably , far off the beating of Love 's wings . The distant stir of that soft plumage roused in him a thouII6 ORLANDO sand memories of rushing waters , of loveliness in the snow and faithlessness in the flood ; and the sound came nearer ; and he blushed and trembled ; and he was moved as he had thought never to be moved again ; and he was ready to raise his hands and let the bird of beauty alight upon his shoulders , when - horror!-a creaking sound like that the crows make tumbling over the trees began to reverberate ; the air seemed dark with coarse black wings ; voices croaked ; bits of straw , twigs , and feathers dropped ; and there pitched down upon his shoulders the heaviest and foulest of the birds ; which is the vulture . Then he rushed from the room and sent the footman to see the Archduchess Harriet to her carriage . - to which we may now return , has two faces ; one white , the other black ; two bodies ; one smooth , the other hairy . It has two hands , two feet , two tails , two , indeed , of every member and each one is the exact opposite of the other . Yet , so strictly are they joined together that you can not separate them . In this case , Orlando 's love began her flight towards him with her white face turned , and her smooth and lovely body outwards . Nearer and nearer she came wafting before her airs of pure delight . All of a sudden ( at the sight of the Archduchess presumably ) she wheeled about , turned the other way round ; showed herself black , hairy , brutish ; -and it was Lust the vulture , not Love , the Bird of ParaI I7 ORLA NDO dise that flopped , foully and disgustingly , upon his shoulders . Hence he ran ; hence he fetched the footman . But the harpy is not so easily banished as all that . Not only did the Archduchess continue to lodge at the baker 's , but Orlando was haunted every day and night by phantoms of the foulest kind . Vainly , it seemed , had he furnished his house with silver and hung the walls with arras , when at any moment a dung - bedraggled fowl could settle upon his writing table . There she was , flopping about among the chairs ; he saw her waddling ungracefully across the galleries . Now , she perched , topheavy upon a fire screen . When he chased her out , back she came and pecked at the glass till she broke it . Thus realising that his home was uninhabitable , and that steps must be taken to end the matter instantly , he did what any other young man would have done in his place , and asked King Charles to send him as Ambassador Extraordinary to Constantinople . The King was walking in Whitehall . Nell Gwyn was on his arm . She was pelting him with hazel nuts . 'Twas a thousand pities , that amorous lady sighed , that such a pair of legs should leave the country . Howbeit , the Fates were hard ; she could do no more than toss one kiss over -her shoulder before Orlando sailed . CHA P TER THREE IT is , indeed , highly unfortunate , and much to be regretted that at this stage of Orlando 's career , when he played a most important part in the public life of his country , we have least information to go upon .

Indeed , the sight was one of indescribable magnificence . I found myself alternately praising the Lord that he had permitted ... and wishing that my poor , dear mother .... By the Ambassador 's orders , the long windows , which are so imposing a feature of Eastern architecture , for though ignorant in many ways .. were thrown wide ; and within , we could see a tableau vivant or theatrical display in which English ladies and gentlemen ... represented a masque the work of one .... The words were inaudible , but the sight of so many of our countrymen and women , dressed 127 ORLANDO with the highest elegance and distinction ... moved me to emotions of which I am certainly not ashamed , though unable .... I was intent upon observing the astonishing conduct of Lady - which was of a nature to fasten the eyes of all upon her , and to bring discredit upon her sex and country , when"-unfortunately

Such princely manners ! ! ! To see him come into the room ! To see him go out again ! And something interesting in the expression , which makes one feel , one scarcely knows why , that he has suf / ered ! They say a lady was the cause of it . The heartless monster ! ! !

35315	35493	34990	34990	she	384	" as the clock struck twelve , the Ambassador appeared on the centre Balcony which was hung with priceless rugs . Six Turks of the Imperial Body Guard , each over six foot in height , held torches to his right and left . Rockets rose into the air at his appearance , and a great shout went up from the people , which the Ambassador acknowledged , 129 ORLANDO bowing deeply , and speaking a few words of thanks in the Turkish language , which it was one of his accomplishments to speak with fluency . Next , Sir Adrian Scrope , in the full dress of a British Admiral advanced ; the Ambassador knelt on one knee ; the Admiral placed the Collar of the Most Noble Order of the Bath round his neck , then pinned the Star to his breast ; after which another gentleman of the diplomatic corps advancing in a stately manner placed on his shoulders the ducal robes , and handed him on a crimson cushion , the ducal coronet . "
35963	36860	35923	35923	she	1813	" ORLANDO washer - woman said , they embraced passionately ' like lovers , ' and went into the room together , drawing the curtains so that no more could be seen . Next morning , the Duke , as we must now call him , was found by his secretaries sunk in profound slumber amid bed clothes that were much tumbled . The room was in some disorder , his coronet having rolled on the floor , and his cloak and garter being flung all of a heap on a chair . The table was littered with papers . No suspicion was felt at first , as the fatigues of the night had been great . But when afternoon came and he still slept , a doctor was summoned . He applied the remedies which had been used on the previous occasion , plasters , nettles , emetics , etc . , but without success . Orlando slept on . His secretaries then thought it their duty to examine the papers on the table . Many were scribbled over with ' poetry , in which frequent mention was made of an oak tree . There were also various state papers and others of a private nature concerning the management of his estates in England . But at length they came upon a document of far greater significance . It was nothing less , indeed , than a deed of marriage , drawn up , signed , and witnessed between his Lordship , Orlando , Knight of the Garter , etc . etc . etc . , and Rosina Pepita , a dancer , father unknown , but reputed a gipsy , mother also unknown but reputed a seller of old iron in the market132 ORLANDO place over against the Galata Bridge . The secretaries looked at each other in dismay . And still Orlando slept . Morning and evening they watched him , but , save that his breathing was regular and his cheeks still flushed their habitual deep rose , he gave no sign of life . Whatever science or ingenuity could do to waken him they did . But still he slept . On the seventh day of his trance ( Thursday , May the Ioth ) the first shot was fired of that terrible and bloody insurrection of which Lieutenant Brigge had detected the first symptoms . The Turks rose against the Sultan , set fire to the town , and put every foreigner they could find , either to the sword or to the bastinado . A few English managed to escape ; but , as might have been expected , the gentlemen of the British Embassy preferred to die in defence of their red boxes , or , in extreme cases , to swallow bunches of keys rather than let them fall into the hands of the Infidel . The rioters broke into Orlando 's room , but seeing him stretched to all appearance dead they left him untouched , and only robbed him of his coronet and the robes of the Garter . And now again obscurity descends , and would indeed that it were deeper ! Would , we almost have it in our hearts to exclaim , that it were so deep that we could see nothing whatever through its opacity ! Would that we might here take the pen and write Finis to our work ! I33 ORLAND O Would that we might spare the reader what is to come and say to him in so many words , Orlando died and was buried . But here , alas , Truth , Candour , and Honesty , the austere Gods who keep watch and ward by the inkpot of the biographer , cry No ! Putting their silver trumpets to their lips they demand in one blast , Truth ! And again they cry Truth i and sounding yet a third time in concert they peal forth , The Truth and nothing but the Truth ! At which — Heaven be praised ! for it affords us a breathing space - the doors gently open , as if a breath of the gentlest and holiest zephyr had wafted them apart , and three figures enter . First , comes our Lady of Purity ; whose brows are bound with fillets of the whitest lamb 's wool ; whose hair is an avalanche of the driven snow ; and in whose hand reposes the white quill of a virgin goose . Following her , but with a statelier step , comes our Lady of Chastity ; on whose brow is set like a turret of burning but unwasting fire a diadem of icicles ; her eyes are pure stars , and her fingers , if they touch you , freeze you to the bone . Close behind her , sheltering indeed in the shadow of her more stately sisters , comes our Lady of Modesty , frailest and fairest of the three ; whose face is only shown as the young moon shows when it is thin and sickle shaped and half hidden among clouds . Each advances towards the centre of the room where I34 ORLANDO Orlando still lies sleeping ; and with gestures at once appealing and commanding , Our Lady of Purity speaks first : "
36935	36942	36959	36959	she	0	" Here the trumpets peal forth . "
36949	36956	36957	36957	I	0	" Then Our Lady Chastity speaks : "

37047	37063	37064	37064	I	0	" Then Our Lady of Modesty speaks , so low that one can hardly hear : "
37138	37145	37128	37128	I	0	" Again the trumpets peal forth : "
37152	37178	37185	37185	your	1827	" With gestures of grief and lamentation the three sisters now join hands and dance slowly , tossing their veils and singing as they go : "
37230	37252	37296	37297	Horrid Sisters	397	" Here they make as if to cover Orlando with their draperies . The trumpets , meanwhile , still blare forth : "
37261	37295	37296	37297	Horrid Sisters	397	" At this the Sisters try to cast their veils over the mouths of the trumpets so as to muffle them , but in vain , for now all trumpets blare forth together . "
37301	37321	37296	37297	Horrid Sisters	397	" The Sisters become distracted and wail in unison , still circling and flinging their veils up and down . "
37391	37541	37542	37542	They	1835	" For there , not here ( all speak together joining hands and making gestures of farewell and despair towards the bed where Orlando lies sleeping ) dwell still in nest and boudoir , office and lawcourt those who love us ; those who honour us , virgins and city men ; lawyers and doctors ; those who prohibit ; those who deny ; those who reverence without knowing why ; those who praise without understanding ; the still very numerous ( Heaven be praised ) tribe of the respectable ; who prefer to see not ; desire to know not ; love the darkness ; those still worship us , and with reason ; for we have given them Wealth , Prosperity , Comfort , Ease . To them we go , you we leave . Come , Sisters come ! This is no place for us here . "

57689	57801	57678	57678	she	429	" for base as you may be , am I not still baser ? It is you who nourish and protect me , you who scare the wild beast , frighten the savage , make me clothes of the silk worm 's wool , and carpets of the sheep 's . If I want to worship have you not provided me with an image of yourself and set it in the sky ? Are not evidences of your care everywhere ? How humble , how grateful , how docile , should I not be , therefore ? Let it be all my joy to serve , honour , and obey you . "
57884	57890	57891	57891	she	429	" It is equally vain , "
57894	57938	57891	57891	she	429	" for you to think you can protect me , or for me to think I can worship you . The 206 ORLANDO light of truth beats upon us without shadow , and the light of truth is damnably unbecoming to us both . "
58799	58922	58796	58797	the Spectator	2668	" I consider woman as a beautiful , romantic animal , that may be adorned with furs and feathers , pearls and diamonds , ores and silks . The lynx shall cast its skin at her feet to make her a tippet , the peacock , parrot and swan shall pay contributions to her muff ; the sea shall be searched for shells , and the rocks for gems , and every part of nature furnish out its share towards the embellishment of a creature that is the most consummate work of it . All this , I shall indulge them in , but as for the petticoat I have been speaking of , I neither can , nor will allow it . "
59062	59552	59051	59051	us	2672	" I enjoyed perfect Health of Body and Tranquillity 210 ORLA ND O of Mind ; I did not find the Treachery or Inconstancy of a Friend , nor the Injuries of a secret or open Enemy . I had no occasion of bribing , flattering or pimping , to procure the Favour of any great Man or of his Minion . I wanted no Fence against Fraud or Oppression ; Here was neither Physician to destroy my Body , nor Lawyer to ruin my Fortune ; No Informer to watch my Words , and Actions , or forge Accusations against me for Hire : Here were no Gibers , Censurers , Backbiters , Pickpockets , Highwaymen , House - breakers , Attorneys , Bawds , Buffoons , Gamesters , Politicians , Wits , splenetick tedious Talkers ... But stop , stop your iron pelt of words , lest you flay us all alive , and yourself too ! Nothing can be plainer than that violent man . He is so coarse and yet so clean ; so brutal , yet so kind ; scorns the whole world , yet talks baby language to a girl , and will die , can we doubt it , in a madhouse . So Orlando poured out tea for them all ; and sometimes when the weather was fine , she carried them down to the country with her , and feasted them royally in the Round Parlour , which she had hung with their pictures all in a circle , so that Mr. Pope could not say that Mr. Addison came before him , or the other way about . They were very witty , too ( but their wit is all in their books ) and taught her the most important part of style , which is 2II ORLANDO the natural run of the voice in speaking - a quality which none that has not heard it can imitate , not Greene even , with all his skill ; for it is born of the air , and breaks like a wave on the furniture and rolls and fades away , and is never to be recaptured , least of all by those who prick up their ears , half a century later , and try . They taught her this , merely by the cadence of their voices in speech ; so that her style changed somewhat , and she wrote some very pleasant , witty verses and characters in prose . And so she lavished her wine on them and put bank notes , which they took very kindly , beneath their plates at dinner , and accepted their dedications , and thought herself highly honoured by the exchange . Thus time ran on , and Orlando could often be heard saying to herself with an emphasis which might , perhaps , make the hearer a little suspicious , "
59562	59625	59626	59626	Lord	2685	" ( For she was still in search of that commodity . ) But circumstances soon forced her to consider the matter more narrowly . One day she was pouring out tea for Mr. Pope while as anyone can tell from the verses quoted above he sat very bright - eyed , observant and all crumpledup in a chair by her side . "
59628	59639	59626	59626	Lord	2685	" she thought , as she raised the sugar tongs , "
59653	59681	59626	59626	Lord	2685	" she paused ; for Mr. Pope needed her attention . And yet - let us finish her thought for her - when 212 ORLA NDO anybody says "
59689	59943	59626	59626	Lord	2685	" it is safe to say that they are extremely uneasy at the present moment . Was this life quite so exciting , quite so flattering , quite so glorious as it sounds when the memoir writer has done his work upon it ? For one thing , Orlando had a positive hatred of tea ; for another , the intellect , divine as it is , and all worshipful , has a habit of lodging in the most seedy of carcases , and often , alas , acts the cannibal among the other faculties so that often , where the Mind is biggest , the Heart , the Sense it Char ' Tolerance , Kindliness , and the rest of them scarcely have room to breathe . Then the high opinion poets have of themselves ; then the low one they have of others ; then the enmities , injuries , envies , and repartees in which they are constantly engaged ; then the volubility with which they impart them ; then the rapacity with which they demand sympathy for them ; all this , one may whisper , lest the wits may overhear us , makes pouring out tea a more precarious and , indeed , arduous occupation than is generally allowed . Added to which ( we whisper again lest the women may overhear us ) , there is a little secret which men share among them ; Lord Chesterfield whispered it to his son with strict injunctions to secrecy , "
59971	60193	59953	59956	A man of sense	2689	" which , since children al213 ORLANDO ways hear what they are not meant to , and sometimes , even , grow up , may have somehow leaked out , so that the whole ceremony of pouring out tea is a curious one . A woman knows very well that , though a wit sends her his poems , praises her judgment , solicits her criticism , and drinks her tea , this by no means signifies that he respects her opinions , admires her understanding , or will refuse , though the rapier is denied him , to run her through the body with his pen . All this , we say , whisper it as low as we can , may have leaked out by now ; so that even with the cream jug suspended and the sugar tongs distended the ladies may fidget a little , look out of the window a little , yawn a little , and so let the sugar fall with a great plop - as Orlando did now - into Mr. Pope 's tea . Never was any mortal so ready to suspect an insult or so quick to avenge one as Mr. Pope . He turned to Orlando and presented her instantly with the rough draught of a certain famous line in the "
60198	61163	59953	59956	A man of sense	2689	" Much polish was afterwards bestowed on it , but even in the original it was striking enough . Orlando received it with a curtsey . Mr. Pope left her with a bow . Orlando , to cool her cheeks , for really she felt as if the little man had struck her , strolled in the nut grove at the bottom of the garden . Soon the cool breezes did their work . To her amazement she found that she was hugely relieved to find herself alone . She watched the merry 2I4 ORLANDO boatloads rowing up the river . No doubt the sight put her in mind of one or two incidents in her past life . She sat herself down in profound meditation beneath a willow tree . There she sat till the stars were in the sky . Then she rose , turned , and went into the house , where she sought her bedroom and locked the door . Now she opened a cupboard in which hung still many of the clothes she had worn as a young man of fashion , and from among them she chose a black velvet suit richly trimmed with Venetian lace . It was a little out of fashion , indeed , but it fitted her to perfection and dressed in it she looked the very figure of a noble Lord . She took a turn or two before the mirror to make sure that her petticoats had not lost her the freedom of her legs , and then let herself secretly out of doors . It was a fine night early in April . A myriad stars mingling with the light of a sickle moon , which again was enforced by the street lamps , made a light infinitely becoming to the human countenance and to the architecture of Mr. Wren . Everything appeared in its tenderest form , yet , just as it seemed on the point of dissolution , some drop of silver sharpened it to animation . Thus it was that talk should be , thought Orlando ( indulging in foolish reverie ) ; that society should be , that friendship should be , that love should be . For , Heaven knows why , just as we have lost faith in human inter215 ORLANDO course some random collocation of barns and trees or a haystack and a waggon presents us with so perfect a symbol of what is unattainable that we begin the search again . She entered Leicester Square as she made these observations . The buildings had an airy yet formal symmetry not theirs by day . The canopy of the sky seemed most dexterously washed in to fill up the outline of roof and chimney . A young woman who sat dejectedly with one arm drooping by her side , the other reposing in her lap , on a seat beneath a plane tree in the middle of the square seemed the very figure of grace , simplicity , and desolation . Orlando swept her hat off to her in the manner of a gallant paying his addresses to a lady of fashion in a public place . The young woman raised her head . It was of the most exquisite shapeliness . The young woman raised her eyes . Orlando saw them to be of a lustre such as is sometimes seen on teapots but rarely in a human face . Through this silver glaze the girl looked up at him ( for a man he was to her ) appealing , hoping , trembling , fearing . She rose ; she accepted his arm . For - need we stress the point?.she was of the tribe which nightly burnishes their wares , and sets them in order on the common counter to wait the highest bidder . She led Orlando to the room in Gerrard Street which was her lodging . To feel her hanging lightly yet like a suppliant on -216 ORLANDO her arm , roused in Orlando all the feelings which become a man . She looked , she felt , she talked like one . Yet , having been so lately a woman herself , she suspected that the girl 's timidity and her hesitating answers and the very fumbling with the key in the latch and the fold of her cloak and the droop of her wrist were all put on to gratify her masculinity . Upstairs they went , and the pains which the poor creature had been at to decorate her room and hide the fact that she had no other deceived Orlando not a moment . The deception roused her scorn ; the truth roused her pity . One thing showing through the other bred the oddest assortment of feeling , so that she did not know whether to laugh or to cry . Meanwhile Nell as the girl called herself , unbuttoned her gloves ; carefully concealed the left hand thumb which wanted mending ; then drew behind a screen , where , perhaps , she rouged her cheeks , arranged her clothes , fixed a new kerchief round her neck - all the time prattling as women do , to amuse her lover , though Orlando could have sworn , from the tone of her voice , that her thoughts were elsewhere . When all was ready , out she came , preparedbut here Orlando could stand it no longer . In the strangest torment of anger , merriment , and pity she flung off all disguise and admitted herself a woman . At this , Nell burst into such a roar of laughter as might have been heard across the way . 217 ORLANDO "
61169	61179	59953	59956	A man of sense	2689	" she said , when she had somewhat recovered , "
61198	61228	59953	59956	A man of sense	2689	" ( and it was remarkable how soon on discovering that they were of the same sex , her manner changed and she dropped her plaintive , appealing ways ) "
61266	61729	59953	59956	A man of sense	2689	" Whereupon , drawing up the fire and stirring a bowl of Punch , she told Orlando the whole story of her life . Since it is Orlando 's life that engages us at present , we need not relate the adventures of the other lady , but it is certain that Orlando had never known the hours speed faster or more merrily , though Mistress Nell had not a particle of wit about her , and when the name of Mr. Pope came up in talk asked innocently if he were connected with the perruque maker of that name in Jermyn Street . Yet , to Orlando , such is the charm of ease and the seduction of beauty , this poor girl 's talk , larded though it was with the commonest expressions of the street corners tasted like wine after the fine phrases she had been used to , and she was forced to the conclusion that there was something in the sneer of Mr. Pope , in the condescension of Mr. Addison , and in the secret of Lord Chesterfield which took away her relish for the society of wits , deeply though she must continue to respect their works . 2I8 ORLANDO These poor creatures , she ascertained , for Nell brought Prue , and Prue Kitty , and Kitty Rose , had a society of their own of which they now elected her a member . Each would tell the story of the adventures which had landed her in her present way of life . Several were the natural daughters of earls and one was a good deal nearer than she should have been to the King 's person . None was too wretched or too poor but to have some ring or handkerchief in her pocket which stood her in lieu of pedigree . So they would draw round the Punch bowl which Orlando made it her business to furnish generously , and many were the fine tales they told and many the amusing observations they made for it can not be denied that when women get together - but hist - they are always careful to see that the doors are shut and that not a word of it gets into print . All they desire is - but hist again - is that not a man 's step on the stair ? All they desire , we were about to say when the gentleman took the very words out of our mouths . Women have no desires , says this gentleman , coming into Nell 's parlour ; only affectations . Without desires ( shehas served him and he is gone ) their conversation can not be of the slightest interest to anyone . "
61735	61741	59953	59956	A man of sense	2689	" says Mr. S. W. , "
61776	61806	61773	61773	they	2693	" And since they 2I9 ORLANDO can not talk together and scratching can not continue without interruption and it is well known ( Mr. T. R. has proved it ) "
61829	62028	62029	62031	Lord " So	3854	" what can we suppose that women do when they seek out each other 's society ? As that is not a question that can engage the attention of a sensible man , let us , who enjoy the immunity of all biographers and historians from any sex whatever , pass it over , and merely state that Orlando professed great enjoyment in the society of her own sex , and leave it to the gentlemen to prove , as they are very fond of doing , that this is impossible . But to give an exact and particular account of Orlando 's life at thi time becomes more and more out of the question . As we peer and grope in the ill - lit , ill - paved , ill - ventilated courtyards that lay about Gerrard Street and Drury Lane at that time , we seem now to catch sight of her and then again to lose it . What makes the task of identification still more difficult is that she found it convenient at this time to change frequently from one set of clothes to another . Thus she often occurs in contemporary memoirs as "
62030	63302	62029	62031	Lord " So	3854	" So - and - so , who was in fact her cousin ; her bounty is ascribed to him , and it is he who is said to have written the poems that were really hers . She had , it seems , no difficulty in sustaining the 220 ORLANDO different parts , for her sex changed far more frequently than those who have worn only one set of clothing can conceive ; nor can there be any doubt that she reaped a twofold harvest by this device ; the pleasures of life were increased and its experiences multiplied . From the probity of breeches she turned to the seductiveness of petticoats and enjoyed the love of both sexes equally . So then one may sketch her spending her morning in a China robe of ambiguous gender among her books ; then receiving a client or two ( for she had many scores of suppliants ) in the same garment ; then she would take a turn in the garden and clip the nut trees - for which knee breeches were convenient ; then she would change into a flowered taffeta which best suited a drive to Richmond and a proposal of marriage from some great nobleman ; and so back again to town , where she would don a snuff - coloured gown like a lawyer 's and visit the courts to hear how her cases were doing - for her fortune was wasting hourly and the suits seemed no nearer consummation than they had been a hundred years ago ; and so , finally , when night came , she would more often than not become a nobleman complete from head to toe and walk the streets in search of adventure . Returning from some of these junketings - of which there were many stories told at the time , as , that she fought a duel , served on one of the King 's ships as a cap . 22I ORLANDO tain , was seen to dance naked on a balcony , and fled with a certain lady to the Low Countries where the lady 's husband followed them ( but of the truth or otherwise of these stories , we express no opinion ) , returning from whatever her occupation may have been , she made a point sometimes of passing beneath the windows of a coffee house , where she could see the wits without being seen , and thus could fancy from their gestures what wise , witty , or spiteful things they were saying without hearing a word of them which was perhaps an advantage ; and once she stood half an hour watching three shadows on the blind drinking tea together in a house in Bolt Court . Never was any play so absorbing . She wanted to cry out , Bravo ! Bravo ! For , to be sure , what a fine drama it was - what a page torn from the thickest volume of human life ! There was the little shadow with the pout — ing lips , fidgeting this way and that on his chair , uneasy , petulant , officious ; there was the bent female shadow , crooking a finger in the cup to feel how deep the tea was , for she was blind ; and there was the Roman - looking rolling shadow in the big arm - chair - he who twisted his fingers so oddly and jerked his head from side to side and swallowed down the tea in such vast gulps . Dr. Johnson , Mr. Boswell , and Mrs. Williams , those were the shadows ' names . So absorbed was she in the sight , 222 ORLANDO that she forgot to think how other ages would have envied her , though it seems probable that on this occasion they would . She was content to gaze and gaze . At length Mr. Boswell rose . He saluted the old woman with tart asperity . But with what humility did he not abase himself before the great rolling shadow , who now rose to its full height and rocking somewhat as he stood there rolled out the most magnificent phrases that have ever left human lips ; so Orlando thought them , though she never heard a word that any of the three shadows said as they sat there drinking tea . At length she came home one night after one of these saunterings and mounted to her bedroom . She took off her laced coat and stood there in shirt and breeches looking out of the window . There was something stirring in the air which forbade her to go to bed . A white haze lay over the town , for it was a frosty night in midwinter and a magnificent vista lay all round her . She could see St. Paul 's , the Tower , Westminster Abbey , with all the spires and domes of the city churches , the smooth bulk of its banks , the opulent and ample curves of its halls and meeting - places . On the north rose the smooth , shorn heights of Hampstead , and in the west the streets and squares of Mayfair shone out in one clear radiance . Upon this serene and orderly prospect the stars looked down , glittering , positive , hard , from a cloudless sky . In the 223 ORLANDO extreme clearness of the atmosphere the line of every roof , the cowl of every chimney was perceptible . Even the cobbles in the streets showed distinct one from another ; and Orlando could not help comparing this orderly scene with the irregular and huddled purlieus which had been the city of London in the reign of Queen Elizabeth . Then , she remembered , the city , if such one could call it , lay crowded , a mere huddle and conglomeration of houses , under her windows at Blackfriars . The stars reflected themselves in deep pits of stagnant water which lay in the middle of the streets . A black shadow at the corner where the wine shop used to stand was as likely as not , the corpse of a murdered man . She could remember the cries of many a one wounded in such night brawlings , when she was a little boy , held to the diamond - paned window in her nurse 's arms . Troops of ruffians , men and women , unspeakably interlaced , lurched down the streets , trolling out wild songs with jewels flashing in their ears , and knives gleaming in their fists . On such a night as this the impermeable tangle of the forests on Highgate and Hampstead would be outlined , writhing in contorted intricacy against the sky . Here and there , on one of the hills which rose above London , was a stark gallows tree , with a corpse nailed to rot or parch on its cross ; for danger and insecurity , lust and violence , poetry and filth swarmed over the tor224 ORLANDO tuous Elizabethan highways and buzzed and stankOrlando could remember even now the smell of them on a hot night - in the little rooms and narrow pathways of the city . Now - she leant out of her window- i11 was light , order , and serenity . There was the faint rattle of a coach on the cobbles . She heard the far - away cry of the nightwatchman-"Just
63310	64449	62029	62031	Lord " So	3854	" No sooner had the words left his lips than the first stroke of midnight sounded . Orlando then for the first time noticed a small cloud gathered behind the dome of St. Paul 's . As the stroke sounded , the cloud increased , and she saw it darken and spread with extraordinary speed . At the same time a light breeze rose and by the time the sixth stroke of midnight had struck the whole of the eastern sky was covered with an irregular moving darkness , though the sky to the west and north stayed clear as ever . Then the cloud spread north . Height upon height above the city was engulfed by it . Only Mayfair , with all its lights , burnt more brilliantly than ever by contrast . With the eighth stroke , some hurrying tatters of cloud sprawled over Piccadilly . They seemed to mass themselves and to advance with extraordinary rapidity towards the west end . As the ninth , tenth and eleventh strokes struck , a huge blackness sprawled over the whole of London . With the twelfth stroke of midightrthe darkness was complete . A tunecloud cu ov225 ORLANDO ered the city . All was dark ; all was doubt ; all was confusion . The Eighteenth century was over ; the Nineteenth century had begun . 226 I CHAPTER FIVE THIS great cloud which hung , not only over London , but over the whole of the British Isles on the first day of the nineteenth century stayed , or rather , did not stay , for it was buffeted about constantly by blustering gales , long enough to have extraordinary consequences upon those who lived beneath its shadow . A change seemed to have come over the climate of England . Rain fell frequently , but only in fitful gusts , which were no sooner over than they began again . The sun shone , of course , but it was so girt about with clouds and the air was so saturated with water , that its beams were discoloured and purples , oranges , and reds of a dull sort took the place of the more positive landscapes of the eighteenth century . Under this bruised and sullen canopy the green of the cabbages was less intense , and the white of the snow was muddied . But what was worse , damp now began to make its way into every housedamp , which is the most insidious of all enemies , for while the sun can be shut out by blinds , and the frost roasted by a hot fire , damp steals in while we sleep ; damp is silent , imperceptible , ubiquitous . Damp swells the 227 ORLANDO wood , furs the kettle , rusts the iron , rots the stone . So gradual is the process , that it is not until we pick up some chest of drawers , or coal scuttle , and the whole thing drops to pieces in our hands , that we suspect even that the disease is at work . Thus , stealthily , and imperceptibly , none marking the exact day or hour of the change , the constitution of England was altered and nobody knew it . Everywhere the effects were felt . The hardy country gentleman , who had sat down gladly to a meal of ale and beef in a room designed , perhaps by the brothers Adam , with classic dignity , now felt chilly . Rugs appeared , beards were grown and trousers fastened tight under the instep . The chill which he felt in his legs he soon transferred to his house ; furniture was muffled ; walls and tables were covered too . Then a change of diet became essential . The muffin was invented and the crumpet . Coffee supplanted the after - dinner port , and , as coffee led to a drawing - room in which to drink it , and a drawing - room to glass cases , and glass cases to artificial flowers , and artificial flowers to mantelpieces , and mantelpieces to pianofortes , and pianofortes to drawing - room ballads , and drawing - room ballads ( skipping a stage or two ) to innumerable little dogs , mats , and antimacassars , the home - which had become extremely important - was completely altered . 228 ORLA ND O Outside the house - it was another effect of the damp -ivy grew in unparalleled profusion . Houses that had been of bare stone were smothered in greenery . No garden , however formal its original design , lacked a shrubbery , a wilderness , a maze . What light penetrated to the bedrooms where children were born was naturally of an obfusc green and what light penetrated to the drawingrooms where grown men and women lived came through curtains of brown and purple plush . But the change did not stop at outward things . The damp struck within . Men felt the chill in their hearts ; the damp in their minds . In a desperate effort to snuggle their feelings into some sort of warmth one subterfuge was tried after another . Love , birth , and death were all swaddled in a variety of fine phrases . The sexes drew further and further apart . No open conversation was tolerated . Evasions and concealments were sedulously practised on both sides . And just as the ivy and the evergreen rioted in the damp earth outside , so did the same fertility show itself within . The life of the average woman was a succession of childbirths . She married at nineteen and had fifteen or eighteen children by the time she was thirty ; for twins abounded . Thus the British Empire came into existence ; and thus - for there is no stopping damp ; it gets into the inkpot as it gets into the woodwork - sentences swelled , adjectives multiplied , lyrics became epics , 229 ORLANDO and little trifles that had been essays a column long were now encyclopaedias in ten or twenty volumes ' . But Eusebius Chubb shall be our witness to the effect this all had upon the mind of a sensitive man who could do nothing to stop it . There is a passage towards the end of his memoirs where he describes how , after writing thirty - five folio pages one morning ' all about nothing ' he screwed the lid on his inkpot and went for a turn in his garden . Soon he found himself involved in the shrubbery . Innumerable leaves creaked and glistened above his head . He seemed to himself "
64462	64503	62029	62031	Lord " So	3854	" Thick smoke exuded from a damp bonfire at the end of the garden . He reflected that no fire on earth could ever hope to consume that vast vegetable encumbrance . Wherever he looked , vegetation was rampant . Cucumbers "
64513	65516	62029	62031	Lord " So	3854	" Giant cauliflowers towered deck above deck till they rivalled , to his disordered imagination , the elm trees themselves . Hens laid incessantly eggs of no special tint . Then , remembering with a sigh his own fecundity and his poor wife Jane , now in the throes of her fifteenth confinement indoors , how , he asked himself , could he blame the fowls ? He looked upwards into the sky . Did not heaven itself , or that great frontispiece of heaven , which is the sky , indicate the assent , indeed , the instigation of the heavenly hierarchy ? For there , winter 230 ORLANDO or summer , year in year out , the clouds turned and tumbled , like whales , he pondered , or elephants rather ; but no , there was no escaping the simile which was pressed upon him from a thousand airy acres ; the whole sky itself as it spread wide above the British Isles was nothing but a vast feather bed ; and the undistinguished fecundity of the garden , the bedroom and the henroost was copied / there . He went indoors , wrote the passage quoted above , laid his head in a gas oven , and when they found him later he was past revival . While this went on in every part of England , it was all very well for Orlando to mew herself in her house at Blackfriars and pretend that the climate was the same ; that one could still say what one liked and wear kneebreeches or skirts as the fancy took one . Even she , at length , was forced to acknowledge that times were changed . One afternoon in the early part of the century she was driving through St. James ' Park in her old panelled coach when one of those sunbeams , which occasionally , though not often , managed to come to earth , struggled through , marbling the clouds with strange prismatic colours as it passed . Such a sight was sufficiently strange after the clear and uniform skies of the eighteenth century to cause her to pull the window down and look at it . The puce and flamingo clouds made her think with a pleasurable anguish , which proves that she 231 ORLANDO was insensibly afflicted with the damp already , of dolphins dying in Ionian seas . But what was her surprise when , as it struck the earth , the sunbeam seemed to call forth , or to light up , a pyramid , hecatomb , or trophy ( for it had something of a banquet - table air)-a conglomeration at any rate of the most heterogeneous and ill - assorted objects , piled higgledy - piggledy in a vast mound where the statue of Queen Victoria now stands ! Draped about a vast cross of fretted and floriated gold were widow 's weeds and bridal veils ; hooked on to other excrescences were crystal palaces , bassinettes , military helmets , memorial wreaths , trousers , whiskers , wedding cakes , cannon , Christmas trees , telescopes , extinct monsters , globes , maps , elephants and mathematical - instruments - the whole supported like a gigantic coat of arms on the right side by a female figure clothed in flowing white ; on the left , by a portly gentleman wearing a frock - coat and sponge - bag trousers . The incongruity of the objects , the association of the fully clothed and the partly draped , the garishness of the different colours and their plaid - like juxtapositions afflicted Orlando with the most profound dismay . She had never , in all her life , seen anything at once so indecent , so hideous , and so monumental . It might , and indeed it must be , the effect of the sun on the water - logged air ; it would vanish with the first breeze that blew ; but for all that , it looked , as 232 ORLANDO she drove past , as if it were destined to endure for ever . Nothing , she felt , sinking back into the corner of her coach , no wind , rain , sun , or thunder , could ever demolish that garish erection . Only the noses would mottle and the trumpets would rust ; but there they would remain , pointing east , west , south , and north , eternally . She looked back as her coach swept up Constitution Hill . Yes , there it was , still beaming placidly in a light which -she pulled her watch out of her fob - was , of course , the light of twelve o'clock mid - day . None other could be so prosaic , so matter of fact , so impervious to any hint of dawn or sunset , so seemingly calculated to last for ever . She was determined not to look again . Already she felt the tides of her blood run sluggishly . But what was more peculiar , a blush , vivid and singular , overspread her cheeks as she passed Buckingham Palace and her eyes seemed forced by a superior power down upon her knees . Suddenly she saw with a start that she was wearing black breeches . She never ceased blushing till she had reached her country house , which , considering the time it takes four horses to trot thirty miles , will be taken , we hope , as a signal proof of her chastity . Once there , she followed what had now become the most imperious need of her nature and wrapped herself as well as she could in a damask quilt which she snatched from her bed . She explained to the Widow Bartholo233 ORLANDO mew ( who had succeeded good old Grimsditch as housekeeper ) that she felt chilly . "
65524	65534	65522	65522	m'lady	2700	" said the Widow , heaving a profound sigh . "
65540	65640	65522	65522	m'lady	2700	" she said , with a curious , lugubrious complacency , and sure enough , she had only to lay her hand on the oak panels for the fingerprints to be marked there . The ivy had grown so profusely that many windows were now sealed up . The kitchen was so dark that they could scarcely tell a kettle from a cullender . A poor black cat had been mistaken for coals and shovelled on the fire . Most of the maids were already wearing three or four red - flannel petticoats , though the month was August . "
65648	65666	65646	65646	m'lady	2700	" the good woman asked , hugging herself , while the golden crucifix heaved on her bosom , "
65685	65693	65668	65669	the Queen	674	" the good woman hesitated and blushed . "
65697	65838	65668	65669	the Queen	674	" Orlando helped her out ( for the word had reached Blackfriars ) . Mrs. Bartholomew nodded . The tears were already running down her cheeks , but as she wept she smiled . For it was pleasant to weep . Were they not all of them weak women ? wearing crinolines the better to conceal the fact ; the great fact ; the only fact ; but , nevertheless , the deplorable fact ; which every modest woman did her best to deny until denial was impos234 ORLANDO sible ; the fact that she was about to bear a child ? to bear fifteen or twenty children indeed , so that most of a modest woman 's life was spent , after all , in denying what , on one day at least every year , was made obvious . "
65847	65857	65668	65669	the Queen	674	" said Mrs. Bartholomew , mopping up her tears , "
65862	65881	65668	65669	the Queen	674	" And wrapped in a damask bed quilt , to a dish of muffins Orlando now sat down . "
65891	65969	65970	65971	Little man	2703	liberry"- Orlandominced out the horrid Cockney phrase in Mrs. Bartholo — mew 's refined Cockney accents as she drank - but not , she detested the mild fluid - her tea . It was in this very room , she remembered , that Queen Elizabeth had stood astride the fireplace with a flagon of beer in her hand , which she suddenly dashed on the table when Lord Burghley tactlessly used the imperative instead of the subjunctive . "
65974	65980	65970	65971	Little man	2703	man,"- Orlando could hear her say -"is
65992	66273	65970	65971	Little man	2703	" And down came the flagon on the table : there was the mark of it still . But when Orlando leapt to her feet , as the mere thought of that great Queen commanded , the bed quilt tripped her up , and she fell back in her arm - chair with a curse . To - morrow she would have to buy twenty yards or more of black bombazine , she supposed , to make a skirt . And then ( here she blushed ) , she would have to 235 ORLANDO buy a crinoline , and then ( here she blushed ) a bassinette , and then another crinoline , and so on .... The blushes came and went with the most exquisite iteration of modesty and shame imaginable . One might see the spirit of the age blowing , now hot , now cold , upon her cheeks . And if the spirit of the age blew a little unequally , the crinoline being blushed for before the husband , her ambiguous position must excuse her ( eyen her sex was still in dispute ) and the irregular life she had lived before . At length the colour on her cheeks resumed its stability and it seemed as if the spirit of the age - if such indeed it were - lay dormant for a time . Then Orlando felt in the bosom of her shirt as if for some locket or relic of lost affection , and drew out no such thing , but a roll of paper , sea - stained , blood - stained , travel - stained -the manuscript of her poem , "
66278	66514	65970	65971	Little man	2703	" She had carried this about with her for so many years now , and in such hazardous circumstances , that many of the pages were stained , some were torn , while the straits she had been in for writing paper when with the gipsies , had forced her to overscore the margins and cross the lines till the manuscript looked like a piece of darning most conscientiously carried out .. She turned back to the first page and read the date , i 586 , written in her own boyish hand . She had been working at it for close on three hundred years now . It was time to make an end . And so she began 236 ORLA ND O turning and dipping and reading and skipping and thinking as she read how very little she had changed all these years . She had been a gloomy boy , in love with death , as boys are ; and then she had been amorous and florid ; and then she had been sprightly and satirical ; and sometimes she had tried prose and sometimes she had tried the drama . Yet through all these changes she had remained , she reflected , fundamentally the same . She had the same brooding meditative temper , the same love of animals and nature , the same passion for the country and the seasons . "
66518	66530	65970	65971	Little man	2703	" she thought , getting up and going to the window , "
66786	66788	66784	66784	she	462	" Impossible "
67422	67432	67433	67433	she	462	" Let me look at your ring , Bartholomew , "

69846	69855	69856	69856	she	462	"The roots shall twine about them . Ah ! "
69868	69914	69915	69915	she	462	" I have sought happiness through many ages and not -found it ; fame and missed it ; love and not known it ; life - and behold , death is better . I have known many 248 ORLA ND O men and many women , "
69918	69954	69915	69915	she	462	" none have I understood . It is better that I should lie at peace here with only the sky above me - as the gipsy told me years ago . That was in Turkey . "

71206	71397	71398	71398	Orlando	259	" and so they talked two hours or more , perhaps about / Cape Horn , perhaps not , and really it would profit little to write down what they said , for they knew each other so well that they could say anything they liked , which is tantamount to saying nothing , or saying such stupid , prosy things , as how to cook an omelette , or where to buy the best boots in London , which have no lustre taken from their setting , yet are positively of amazing beauty within it . For it has come about , by the wise economy of nature , that our modern spirit can almost dispense with language ; the commonest expressions do , since no expressions do ; hence the most ordinary conversation is often the most poetic , and the most poetic is precisely that which can not be written down . For which reasons we leave a great blank here , which must be taken to indicate that the space is filled to repletion . 253 ORLANDO After some days more of this kind of talk , "
71403	71438	71398	71398	Orlando	259	" Shel was beginning , when there was a scuffling outside , and Basket the butler entered with the information that there was a couple of Peelers downstairs with a warrant from the Queen . "
71443	71579	71398	71398	Orlando	259	" said Shelmerdine briefly , as if on his own quarter deck taking up , by instinct , a stand with his hands behind him in front of the fireplace . Two officers in bottle green uniforms with truncheons at their hips then entered the room and stood at attention . Formalities being over , they gave into Orlando 's own hands , as their commission was , a legal document of some very impressive sort , judging by the blobs of sealing wax , the ribbons , the oaths , and the signatures , which were all of the highest importance . Orlando ran her eyes through it and then , using the first finger of her right hand as pointer , read out the following facts as being most germane to the matter . "
71585	71590	71626	71626	they	2855	" she read out ... "

78592	78599	78600	78600	he	3090	" The truth of it is , "
78610	78642	78643	78643	he	3090	" that all our young writers are in the pay of booksellers . They turn out any trash that serves to pay their tailor 's bills . It is an age , "
78652	78673	78643	78643	he	3090	" marked by precious conceits and wild experiments - none of which the Elizabethans would have tolerated for an instant . "

78755	79013	78753	78753	Glawr	351	" Indeed she could have sworn that she had heard him say the very same things three hundred years ago . The names were different , of course , but the spirit was the same . Nick Greene had not changed , for all his knighthood . And 278 ORLANDO yet , some change there was . For while he ran on about taking Addison as one 's model ( it had been Cicero once , she thought ) and lying in bed of a morning ( which she was proud to think her pension paid quarterly enabled him to do ) rolling the best works of the best authors round and round on one 's tongue for an hour , at least , before setting pen to paper , so that the vulgarity of the present time and the deplorable condition of our native tongue ( he had lived long in America , she believed ) might be purified - while he ran on in much the same way that Greene had run on three hundred years ago , she had time to ask herself , how was it then that he had changed ? He had grown plump ; but he was a man verging on seventy . He had grown sleek : literature had been a prosperous pursuit evidently , but somehow the old restless , uneasy vivacity had gone . His stories , brilliant as they were , were no longer quite so free and easy . He mentioned , it is true , "
79019	79021	79017	79017	Pope	416	" or "
79027	79178	78753	78753	Glawr	351	" every other second , but he had an air of respectability about him , which was depressing , and he preferred , it seemed , to enlighten her about the doings and - sayings of her own blood relations rather than tell her , as he used to do , scandal about the poets . Orlando was unaccountably disappointed . She had thought of literature all these years ( her seclusion , her rank , her sex must be her excuse ) as something wild as 279 ORLANDO the wind , hot as fire , swift as lightning ; something errant , incalculable , abrupt , and behold , literature was an elderly gentleman in a grey suit talking about duchesses . The violence of her disillusionment was such that some hook or button fastening the upper part of her dress burst open , and out upon the table fell "
79183	79187	78753	78753	Glawr	351	" a poem . "
79191	79203	78753	78753	Glawr	351	" said Sir Nicholas , putting on his gold pince nez . "
79218	79391	79212	79212	me	0	" And once more , after an interval of some three hundred years Nicholas Greene took Orlando 's poem , and laying it down among the coffee cups and the liqueur glasses began to read it . But now his verdict was very different from what it had been then . It reminded him , he said as he turned over the pages , of Addison 's Cato . It compared favourably with Thomson 's Seasons . There was no trace in it , he was thankful to say , of the modern spirit . It was composed with a regard to truth , to nature , to the dictates of the I human heart , which was rare indeed , in these days of unscrupulous eccentricity . It must , of course , be pub4 lished instantly . Really Orlando did not know what he meant . She had always carried her manuscripts about with her in the bosom of her dress . The idea tickled Sir Nicholas considerably . 280 ORLANDO "
79397	79846	79395	79395	Royalties	493	" he asked . Orlando 's mind flew to Buckingham Palace and some dusky potentates who happened to be staying there . Sir Nicholas was highly diverted . He explained that he was alluding to the fact that Messrs.- ( here he mentioned a well known firm of publishers ) would be delighted , if he wrote them a line , to put the book on their list . He could probably arrange for a royalty of ten per cent on all copies up to two thousand ; after that it would be fifteen . As for the reviewers , he would himself write a line to Mr.- who was the most influential ; then a compliment - say a little puff of her own poems -addressed to the wife of the editor of the - never did any harm . He would call . So he ran on . Orlando understood nothing of all this , and from old experience did not altogether trust his good nature , but there was nothing for it but to submit to what was evidently his wish and the fervent desire of the poem itself . So Sir Nicholas made the blood.stained packet into a neat parcel ; flattened it into his breast pocket , lest it should disturb the set of his coat ; and with many compliments on both sides , they parted . Orlando walked up the street . Now that the poem was gone,-and she felt a bare place in her breast where she had been used to carry it - she had nothing to do but reflect upon whatever she liked — the extraordinary 281 ORLANDO chances it might be of the human lot . Here she was in St. James ' Street ; a married woman ; with a ring on her finger ; where there had been a coffee house once there was now a Restaurant ; it was about half past three in the afternoon ; the sun was shining ; there were three pigeons ; a mongrel terrier dog ; two hansom cabs and a barouche landau . What then , was Life ? The thought popped into her head violently , irrelevantly ( unless old Greene were somehow the cause of it ) . And it may be taken as a comment , adverse or favourable , as the reader chooses to consider it upon her relations with her husband ( who was at the Horn ) , that whenever anything popped violently into her head , she went straight to the nearest telegraph office and wired to him . There was one , as it happened , close at hand . "

79860	79905	79906	79907	Rattigan Glumphoboo	496	" here she dropped into a cypher language which they had invented between them so that a whole spiritual state of the utmost complexity might be conveyed in a word or two without the telegraph clerk being any the wiser , and added the words "
79909	79956	79906	79907	Rattigan Glumphoboo	496	" which summed it up precisely . For not only had the events of the morning made a deep impression on her , but it can not have escaped the reader 's attention that Orlando was growing up - which is not necessarily growing better - and "
79959	81305	79957	79958	Rattigan Glumphoboo	496	" described a very complicated spiritual state282 ORLANDO which if the reader puts all his intelligence at our service he may discover for himself . There could be no answer to her telegram for some hours ; indeed , it was probable , she thought , glancing at the sky , where the upper clouds raced swiftly past , that there was a gale at Cape Horn , so that her husband would be at the mast head , as likely as not , or cutting away some tattered spar , or even alone in a boat with a biscuit . And so , leaving the post office , she turned to beguile herself into the next shop , which was a shop so common in our day that it needs no description , yet , to her eyes , strange in the extreme ; a shop where they sold books . All her life long Orlando had known manuscripts ; had held in her hands the rough brown sheets on which Spenser had written ' in his little crabbed hand ; she had seen Shakespeare 's script and Milton 's . She owned , indeed , a fair number of quartos and folios often with a sonnet in her praise in them and sometimes a lock of hair . But these innumerable little volumes , bright , identical , ephemeral , for they seemed bound in cardboard and printed on tissue paper , surprised her infinitely . The whole works of Shakespeare cost half a crown and could be put in your pocket . One could hardly read them , indeed , the print was so small , but it was a marvel , none the less . ' Works'- the works of every writer she had known or heard of and many more stretched from end 283 ORLANDO to end of the long shelves . On tables and chairs , more ' works ' were piled and tumbled , and these she saw , turning a page or two , were often works about other works by Sir Nicholas and a score of others whom , in her ignorance , she supposed , since they were bound and printed , to be very great writers too . So she gave an astounding order to the bookseller to send her everything of any importance in the shop and left . She turned into Hyde Park , which she had known of old ( beneath that cleft tree , she remembered , the Duke of Hamilton fell run through the body by Lord Mohun ) and her lips , which are often to blame in the matter , began framing the words of her telegram into a senseless singsong ; life literature Greene toady , Rattigan Glumphoboo ; so that several park keepers looked at her with suspicion and were only brought to a favourable opinion of her sanity by noticing the pearl necklace which she wore . She had carried off a sheaf of papers and critical journals from the book shop , and at length , flinging herself on her elbow beneath a tree , she spread these pages round her and did her best to fathom the noble art of prose composition as these masters practised it . For still the old credulity was alive in her ; even the blurred type of a weekly newspaper had some sanctity in her eyes . So she read , lying on her elbow , an article by Sir Nicholas on the collected works of a man she had once known284 ORLANDO John Donne . But she had pitched herself , without knowing it , not far from the Serpentine . The barking of a thousand dogs sounded in her ears . Carriage wheels rushed ceaselessly in a circle round her . Leaves sighed overhead . Now and again a braided skirt and a pair of tight scarlet trousers crossed the grass within a few steps of her . Once a gigantic rubber ball bounced on the newspaper . Violets , oranges , reds , and blues broke through the interstices of the leaves and sparkled in the emerald on her finger . She was distracted between the two . She looked at the paper and looked up ; she looked at the sky and looked down . Life ? Literature ? One to be made into the other ? But how monstrously difficult ! Forhere came by a pair of tight scarlet trousers - how would Addison have put that ? Here came two dogs dancing on their hind legs . How would Lamb have described that ? For reading Sir Nicholas and his friends ( as she did in the intervals of looking about her ) , she somehow got the impression - here she rose and walked - they made one feel - it was an extremely uncomfortable feeling -'one must never , never say what one thought . ( She stood on the banks of the Serpentine . It was a bronze colour ; spider - thin boats were skimming from side to side . ) They made one feel , she continued , that one must always , always write like somebody else . ( The tears formed themselves in her eyes . ) For really , she thought , pushing z85 ORLA ND 0O a little boat off with her toe , I do n't think I could ( here the whole of Sir Nicholas ' article came before her as articles do , ten minutes after they are read , with the look of his room , his head , his cat , his writing table , and the time of the day thrown in ) , I do n't think I could , she continued , considering the article from this point of view , sit in a study , no , it 's not a study , it 's a mouldy kind of drawing - room , all day long , and talk to pretty young men , and tell them little anecdotes , which they must n't repeat , about what Tupper said about Smiles ; and then , she continued , weeping bitterly , they 're all so manly ; and then , I do detest Duchesses ; and I do n't like cake ; and though I 'm spiteful enough , I could never learn to be as spiteful as all that , so how can I be a critic and write the best English prose of my time ? Damn it all ! she exclaimed , launching a penny steamer so vigorously that the poor little boat almost sank in the bronze coloured waves . Now , the truth is that when one has been in a state of mind ( as nurses call it)-and the tears still stood in Orlando 's eyes - the thing one is looking at becomes , not itself , but another thing , which is bigger and much more important and yet remains the same thing . If one looks at the Serpentine in this state of mind , the waves soon become just as big as the waves on the Atlantic ; the toy boats become indistinguishable from ocean liners . So 286 ORLANDO Orlando mistook the toy boat for her husband 's brig ; and the wave she - had made with her toe for a mountain of water off Cape Horn ; and as she watched the toy boat climb the ripple , she thought she saw Bonthrop 's ship climb up and up a glassy wall ; up and up it went , and a white crest with a thousand deaths in it arched over it ; and through the thousand deaths it went and disappeared -'It 's sunk ! ' she cried out in an agony - and then , behold , there it was again sailing along safe and sound among the ducks on the other side of the Atlantic . "
81308	81312	79957	79958	Rattigan Glumphoboo	496	" she cried . "
81321	81325	79957	79958	Rattigan Glumphoboo	496	" she wondered . "
81338	81341	81489	81489	husband	3120	" And repeating "
81349	81351	81489	81489	husband	3120	" and "
81354	81375	81489	81489	husband	3120	" alternately , for the thoughts were interchangeable and meant exactly the same thing , she hurried towards Park Lane . "
81388	81484	81489	81489	husband	3120	" she repeated , thus enforcing upon herself the fact that it is not articles by Nick Greene on John Donne nor eight - hour bills nor covenants nor factory acts that matter ; it 's something useless , sudden , violent ; something that costs a life ; red , blue , purple ; a spirt ; a splash ; like those hyacinths ( she was passing a fine bed of them ) ; free from taint , dependence , soilure of humanity or care for one 's kind ; something rash , ridiculous , "
81516	81658	81490	81490	I	0	" Thus she spoke aloud , waiting for the carriages to pass at Stanhope Gate , for the consequence of not living with one 's husband , except when the wind is sunk , is that one talks nonsense aloud in Park Lane . It would no doubt have been different had she lived all the year round with him as Queen Victoria recommended . As it was the thought of him would come upon her in a flash . She found it absolutely necessary to speak to him instantly . She did not care in the least what nonsense it might make , or what dislocation it might inflict on the narrative . Nick Greene 's article -had plunged her in the depths of despair ; the toyboat had raised her to the heights of joy . So she repeated : "
81663	83520	81490	81490	I	0	" as she stood waiting to cross . But the traffic was heavy that spring afternoon , and kept her standing there , repeating ecstasy , ecstasy , or a toy boat on the Serpentine , while the wealth and power of England , sat , as if sculptured , in hat and cloak , in four - in - hand , victoria and barouche landau . It was as if a golden river had coagulated and massed itself in golden blocks across Park Lane . The ladies held cardcases between their fingers ; the gentlemen balanced gold - mounted canes between theirknees . She stood there gazing , admiring , awe - struck . One thought only disturbed her , a thought familiar to all who behold great elephants , or whales of an incredible magnitude , and 288 ORLANDO that is how do these leviathans to whom obviously stress , change , and activity are repugnant , propagate their kind ? Perhaps , Orlando thought , looking at the stately , still faces , their time of propagation is over ; this is the fruit ; this is the consummation . What she now beheld was the triumph of an age . Portly and splendid there they sat . But now , the policeman let fall his hand ; the stream became liquid ; the massive conglomeration of splendid objects moved , dispersed and disappeared into Piccadilly . So she crossed Park Lane and went to her house in Curzon Street where , when the meadow - sweet blew there , she could remember curlew calling and one very old man with a gun . She could remember , she thought , stepping across the threshold of her house , how Lord Chesterfield had said -but her memory was checked . Her discreet eighteenth - century hall , where she could see Lord Chesterfield putting his hat down here and his coat down there with an elegance of deportment which it was a pleasure to watch , was now completely littered with parcels . While she had been sitting in Hyde Park the bookseller had delivered her order , and the house was crammedthere were parcels slipping down the staircase - with the whole of Victorian literature done up in grey paper and 289 ORLANDO neatly tied with string . She carried as many of these packets as she could to her room , ordered footmen to bring the others , and , rapidly cutting innumerable strings , was soon surrounded by innumerable volumes . Accustomed to the little literatures of the sixteenth , seventeenth , and eighteenth centuries , Orlando was appalled by the consequences of her order . For , of course , to the Victorians themselves Victorian literature meant not merely four great names separate and distinct but four great names sunk and embedded in a mass of Alexander Smiths , Dixons , Blacks , Milmans , Buckles , Taines , Paynes , Tuppers , Jamesons - all vocal , clamorous , prominent , and requiring as much attention as anybody else . Orlando 's reverence for print had a tough job set before it , but drawing her chair to the window to get the benefit of what light might filter between the high houses of Mayfair , she tried to come to a conclusion . And now it is clear that there are only two ways of coming to a conclusion upon Victorian literature - one is to write it out in sixty volumes octavo , the other is to squeeze it into six lines of the length of this one . Of the two courses , economy , since time runs short , leads us to choose the second ; and so we proceed . Orlando then came to the conclusion ( opening half - a - dozen books ) that it was very odd that there was not a single dedication to a nobleman among them ; next ( turning over a 290 ORLANDO vast pile of memoirs ) that several of these writers had family trees half as high as her own ; next , that it would be impolitic in the extreme to wrap a ten - pound note round the sugar tongs when Miss Christina Rossetti came to tea ; next ( here were half - a - dozen invitations to celebrate centenaries by dining ) that literature since it ate all these dinners must be growing very corpulent ; next ( she was invited to a score of lectures upon the Influence of this upon that ; the Classical revival ; the Romantic survival , and other titles of the same engaging kind ) that literature since it listened to all these lectures must be growing very dry ; next ( here she attended a reception given by a peeress ) that literature since it wore all these fur tippets must be growing very respectable ; next ( here she visited Carlyle 's sound - proof room at Chelsea ) that genius since it needed all this coddling must be growing very delicate ; and so at last she reached her final conclusion , which was of the highest importance but which , as we have already much overpassed our limit of six lines , we must omit . Orlando , having come to this conclusion , stood looking out of the window for a considerable space of time . For , whcn anybody comes to a conclusion it is as if they had tossed the ball over the net and must wait for the unseen antagonist to return it to them . What would be sent her next from the colourless sky above Chesterfield 291 ORLANDO House , she wondered ? And with her hands clasped , she stood for a considerable space of time wondering . Suddenly she started - and here we could only wish that , as on a former occasion , Purity , Chastity , and Modesty would push the door ajar and provide , at least , a breathing space in which we could think how to wrap up what now has to be told delicately , as a biographer should . But no ! Having thrown their white garment at the naked Orlando and seen it fall short by several inches , these ladies had given up all intercourse with her these many years ; and were now otherwise engaged . Is nothing , then , going to happen this pale March morning to mitigate , to veil , to cover , to conceal , to shroud this undeniable event whatever it may be ? For after giving that sudden , violent start , Orlando - but Heaven be praised , at this very moment there struck up outside one of these frail , reedy , fluty , jerky , old - fashioned barrel - organs which are still sometimes played by Italian organ - grinders in back streets . Let us accept the intervention , humble though it is , as if it were the music of the spheres , and allow it , with all its gasps and groans , to fill this page with sound until the moment comes which it is impossible to deny is coming ; which the footman has seen coming and the maid - servant ; and the reader will have to see too ; for Orlando herself is clearly unable to ignore it any longer - let the barrel - organ sound and transport 292 ORLANDO us on thought , which is no more than a little boat , when music sounds , tossing on the waves ; on thought , which is , of all carriers , the most clumsy , the most erratic , over the roof tops and the back gardens where washing is hanging to - what is this place ? Do you recognise the Green and in the middle the steeple , and the gates with a lion couchant on either side ? Oh yes , it is Kew ! Well , Kew will do . So here then we are at Kew , and I will show you to - day ( the second of March ) under the plum tree , a grape hyacinth , and a crocus , and a bud , too , on the almond tree ; so that to walk there is to be thinking of bulbs , hairy and red , thrust into the earth in October ; flowering now ; and to be dreaming of more than can rightly be said , and to be taking from its case a cigarette or cigar even , and to be flinging a cloak under ( as the rhyme requires ) an oak , and there to sit , waiting the kingfisher , which , it is said , was seen once to cross in the evening from bank to bank . Wait ! Wait ! The kingfisher comes ; the kingfisher comes not . Behold , meanwhile , the factory chimneys , and their smoke ; behold the city clerks flashing by in their outrigger . Behold the old lady taking her dog for a walk and the servant girl wearing her new hat for the first time not at the right angle . Behold them all . Though Heaven has mercifully decreed that the secrets of all 293 OR LANDO hearts are hidden so that we are lured on for ever to suspect something , perhaps , that does not exist ; still through our cigarette smoke , we see blaze up and salute the splendid fulfilment of natural desires for a hat , for a boat , for a rat in a ditch ; as once one saw blazing - such silly hops and skips the mind takes when it slops like this all over the saucer and the barrel - organ plays - saw blazing a fire in a field against minarets near Constantinople . Hail ! natural desire ! Hail ! happiness ! divine happiness ! and pleasure of all sorts , flowers and wine , though one fades and the other intoxicates ; and half - crown tickets out of London on Sundays , and singing in a dark chapel hymns about death , and anything , anything that interrupts and confounds the tapping of typewriters and filing of letters and forging of links and chains , binding the Empire together . Hail even the crude , red bows on shop girls ' lips ( as if Cupid , very clumsily , dipped his thumb in red ink and scrawled a token in passing ) . Hail , happiness ! kingfisher flashing from bank to bank , and all fulfilment of natural desire , whether it is what the male novelist says it is ; or prayer ; or denial ; hail ! inwhatever form it comes , and may there be more forms , and stranger . For dark flows the stream - would it were true , as the rhyme hints "
83523	83798	81493	81493	Bonthrop	257	dream"- but duller and worser than that is our usual lot ; without dreams , but alive , smug , fluent , habitual , under trees whose shade 294 ORLANDO of an olive green drowns the blue of the wing . of the vanishing bird when he darts of a sudden from bank to bank . Hail , happiness , then , and after happiness , hail not . those dreams which bloat the sharp image as spotted mirrors do the face in a country - inn parlour ; dreams which splinter the whole and tear us asunder and wound us and split us apart in the night when we would sleep ; but sleep , sleep , so deep that all shapes are ground to dust of infinite softness , water of dimness inscrutable , and there , folded , shrouded , like a mummy , like a moth , prone let us lie on the sand at the bottom of sleep . But wait ! but wait ! we are not going , this time , visiting the blind land . Blue , like a match struck right in the ball of the innermost eye , he flys , burns , bursts the seal of sleep ; the kingfisher ; so that now floods back refluent like a tide , the red , thick stream of life again ; bubbling , dripping ; and we rise , and our eyes ( for how handy a rhyme is to pass us safe over the awkward transition from death to life ) fall on- ( here the barrel - organ stops playing abruptly ) . "
83808	83936	83801	83804	a very fine boy	3123	" said Mrs. Banting , the midwife . In other words Orlando was safely delivered of a son on Thursday , March the 20th , at three o'clock in the morning . 295 ORLA ND O Once more Orlando stood at the window , but let the reader take courage ; nothing of the same sort is going to happen to - day , which is not , by any means , the same day . No - for if we look out of the window , as Orlando was doing at the moment , we shall see that Park Lane itself has considerably changed . Indeed one might stand there ten minutes or more , as Orlando stood now , without seeing a single barouche landau . "
83941	84848	83801	83804	a very fine boy	3123	" she exclaimed , some days later when an absurd truncated carriage without any horses began to glide about of its own accord . A carriage without any horses indeed ! She was called away just as she said that , but came back again after a time and had another look out of the window . It was odd sort of weather nowadays . The sky itself , she could not help thinking had changed . It was no longer so thick , so watery , so prismatic now that King Edward -see , there he was , stepping out of his neat brougham to go and visit a certain lady opposite - had succeeded Queen Victoria . The clouds had shrunk to a thin gauze ; the sky seemed made of metal , which in hot weather tarnished verdigris , copper colour or orange as metal does in a fog . It was a little alarming - this shrinkage . Everything seemed to have shrunk . Driving past Buckingham Palace last night , there was not a trace of that vast erection which she had thought everlasting ; top hats , widows ' weeds , trumpets , telescopes , wreaths , all had 296 ORLANDO vanished and left not a stain , not a puddle even , on the pavement . But it was now - after another interval she had come back again to her favourite station in the window - now , in the evening , that the change was most remarkable . Look at the lights in the houses ! At a touch , a whole room was lit ; hundreds of rooms were lit ; and one was precisely the same as the other . One could see everything in the little square - shaped boxes ; there was no privacy ; none of those lingering shadows and odd corners that there used to be ; none of those women in aprons carrying wobbly lamps which they put down carefully on this table and on that . At a touch , the whole room was bright . And the sky was bright all night long ; and the pavements were bright ; everything was bright . She came back again at mid - day . How narrow women had grown lately ! They looked like stalks of corn , straight , shining , identical . And men 's faces were as bare as the palm of one 's hand . The dryness of the atmosphere brought out the colour in everything and seemed to stiffen the muscles of the cheeks . It was harder to cry now . People were much gayer . Water was hot in two — seconds . Ivy had perished or been scraped off houses . Vegetables were less fertile ; families were much smaller . Curtains and covers had been frizzled up and the walls were bare so that new brilliantly coloured pictures of real things like streets , umbrellas , apples , were hung 297 ORLANDO in frames , or painted upon the wood . There was something definite and distinct about the age , which reminded her of the eighteenth century , except that there was a distraction , a desperation - as she was thinking this , the immensely long tunnel in which she seemed to have been travelling for hundreds of years widened ; the light poured in ; her thoughts became mysteriously tightened and strung up as if a piano tuner had put his key in her back and stretched the nerves very taut ; at the same time her hearing quickened ; she could hear every whisper and crackle in the room so that the clock ticking on the mantelpiece beat like a hammer . And so for some seconds the light went on becoming brighter and brighter , and she saw everything more and more clearly and the clock ticked louder and louder until there was a terrific explosion right in her ear . Orlando leapt as if she had been violently struck on the head . Ten times she was struck . In fact it was ten o'clock in the morning . It was the eleventh of October . It was 1 928 . It was the present moment . No one need wonder that Orlando started , pressed her hand to her heart , and turned pale . For what more terrifying revelation can there be than that it is the present moment ? That we survive the shock at all is only possible because the past shelters us on one side , the future on another . But we have no time now for reflec298 ORLANDO tions ; Orlando was terribly late already . She ran downstairs , jumped into her motor car , pressed the self - starter and was off . Vast blue blocks of building rose into the air ; the red cowls of chimneys were spotted irregularly across the sky ; the road shone like silver - headed nails ; omnibuses bore down upon her with sculptured whitefaced drivers ; she noticed sponges , bird - cages , boxes of green American cloth . But she did not allow these sights to sink into her mind even the fraction of an inch as she crossed the narrow plank of the present , lest she should fall into the raging torrent beneath . "
84866	84963	84861	84861	your	3124	you?"- that was all she said sharply , as if the words were jerked out of her . For the streets were immensely crowded ; people crossed without looking where they were going . People buzzed and hummed round the plate - glass windows within which one could see a glow of red , a blaze of yellow , as if they were bees , Orlando thought - but her thought that they were bees was violently snipped off and she saw , regaining perspective with one flick of her eye , that they were bodies . "
84974	85505	84967	84967	you	3124	" she snapped out . At last , however , she drew up at Marshall & Snelgrove 's and went into the shop . Shade and scent enveloped her . The present fell from her like drops of scald- . ing water . Light swayed up and down like thin stuffs 299 ORLANDO puffed out by a summer breeze . She took a list from her bag and began reading in a curious stiff voice at first as if she were holding the words - boy 's boots , bath salts , sardines - under a tap of many - coloured water . She watched them change as the light fell on them . Bath and boots became blunt , obtuse ; sardines serrated itself like a saw . So she stood in the ground - floor department of Messrs. Marshall & Snelgrove ; looked this way and that ; snuffed this smell and that and thus wasted some seconds . Then she got into the lift , for the good reason that the door stood open ; and was shot smoothly upwards . The very fabric of life now , she thought as she rose , is magic . In the eighteenth century , we knew how everything was done ; but here I rise through the air ; I listen to voices in America ; I see men flying - but how it 's done , I ca n't even begin to wonder . So my belief in magic returns . Now the lift gave a little jerk as it stopped at the first floor ; and she had a vision of innumerable coloured stuffs flaunting in a breeze from which came distinct , strange smells ; and each time the lift stopped and flung its doors open , there was another slice of the world displayed with all the smells of that world clinging to it . She was reminded of the river off Wapping in the time of Elizabeth , where the treasure ships and the merchant ships used to anchor . How richly and curiously they had smelt ! How well she remembered the feel of rough 300 ORLANDO rubies running through her fingers when she dabbled them in a treasure sack ! And then lying with Sukey - or whatever her name was - and having Cumberland 's lantern flashed on them ! The Cumberlands had a house in Portland Place now and she had lunched with them the other day and ventured a little joke with the old man about almshouses in the Sheen Road . He had winked . But here as the lift could go no higher , she must get out -Heaven knows into what ' department ' as they called it . She stood still to consult her shopping list , but was blessed if she could see , as the list bade her , bath salts , or boy 's boots anywhere about . And indeed , she was about to descend again , without buying anything , but was saved from that outrage by saying aloud automatically the last item on her list ; which happened to be "
85512	85513	84967	84967	you	3124	" "
85520	85649	84967	84967	you	3124	" she said to a man at a counter and , by a dispensation of Providence , it was sheets that the man at that particular counter happened to sell . For Grimsditch , no , Grimsditch was dead ; Bartholomew , no , Bartholomew was dead ; Louise thenLouise had come to her in a great taking the other day , for she had found a hole in the bottom of the sheet in the royal bed . Many kings and queens had slept there , Elizabeth ; James ; Charles ; George ; Victoria ; Edward ; no wonder the - sheet had a hole in it . But Louise was posi30I ORLANDO tive she knew who had done it . It was the Prince Consort . "
85653	85671	84967	84967	you	3124	" she said ( for there had been another war ; this time against the Germans ) . "
85678	85869	84967	84967	you	3124	" Orlando repeated dreamily , for a double bed with a silver counterpane in a room fitted in a taste which she now thought perhaps a little vulgar - all in silver ; but she had furnished it when she had a passion for that metal . While the man went to get sheets for a double bed , she took out a little looking - glass and a powder puff . Women were not nearly as roundabout in their ways , she thought , powdering herself with the greatest unconcern , as they had been when she herself first turned woman and lay on the deck of the Enamoured Lady . She gave her nose the right tint deliberately . She never touched her cheeks . Honestly , though she was now thirty - six , she scarcely looked a day older . She looked just as pouting , as sulky , as handsome , as rosy ( like a million - candled Christmas tree , Sasha had said ) as she had done that day on the ice , when the Thames was frozen and they had gone skating "
85877	85989	85875	85875	Ma'am	3125	" said the shopman , spreading the sheets on the counter,-and they had met an old woman picking up sticks . Here , as she was fingering the linen abstractedly , one of the swing - doors between the departments opened and let through , perhaps from the fancy - goods department , a whiff of scent,:302 ORLANDO waxen , tinted as if from pink candles , and the scent curved like a shell round a figure - was it a boy 's or was it a girl's - furred , pearled , in Russian trousersyoung , slender , seductive - a girl , by God ! but faithless , faithless ! "
85992	86105	86108	86108	Sasha	288	" cried Orlando ( the man had gone ) and all the shop seemed to pitch and toss with yellow water and far off she saw the masts of the Russian ship standing out to sea , and then , miraculously ( perhaps the door opened again ) the conch which the scent had made became a platform , a dais , off which stepped a fat , furred woman , marvellously well preserved , seductive , diademed , a Grand Duke 's mistress ; she who , leaning over the banks of the Volga , eating sandwiches , had watched men drown ; and began walking down the shop toward her . "
86110	86186	86108	86108	Sasha	288	" Orlando cried . Really , she was shocked that she should have come to this ; she had grown so fat ; so lethargic ; and she bowed her head over the linen so that this apparition of a grey woman in fur , and a girl in Russian trousers with all these smells of wax candles , white flowers and Russian sailors that it brought with it might pass behind her back unseen . "
86199	86484	86197	86197	Ma'am	407	" the shopman persisted . And it is enormously to the credit of the shopping list , which Orlando now consulted , that 303 ORLA NDO she was able to reply with every appearance of composure , that there was only one thing in the world she wanted and that was bath salts ; which was in another department . But descending in the lift again - so insidious is the repetition of any scene - she was again sunk far beneath the present moment ; and thought when the lift bumped on the ground , that she heard a pot broken against a river bank . As for finding the right department , whatever it might be , she stood engrossed among the handbags , deaf to the suggestions of all the polite , black , combed , sprightly , shop assistants , who descending as they did equally and some of them , perhaps , as proudly , even from such depths of the past as she did , chose to let down the impervious screen of the present so that to - day they appeared shop assistants in Marshall and Snelgrove 's merely . Orlando stood there hesitating . Through the great glass doors she could see the traffic in Oxford Street . Omnibus seemed to pile itself upon omnibus and then to jerk itself apart . So the ice blocks had pitched and tossed that day on the Thames . An old nobleman in furred slippers had sat astride one of them . There he went - she could see him now - calling down maledictions upon the Irish rebels . He had sunk there , where her car stood . "
86491	86500	86197	86197	Ma'am	407	" she thought , trying to collect herself ; "
86567	86579	86556	86556	I	0	" here she stepped on to the pavement of Oxford Street , "
86605	86915	86549	86553	a girl in Russian trousers	3128	" Her eyes filled with tears . That Orlando had gone a little too far from the present moment will , perhaps , strike the reader who sees her now preparing to get into her motor car with her eyes full of tears and visions of Persian mountains . And indeed , it can not be denied that the most successful practitioners of the art of life , often unknown people by the way , somehow contrive to synchronise the sixty or seventy different times which beat simultaneously in every normal human system so that when eleven strikes , all the rest chime in unison , and the present is neither a violent disruption nor completely forgotten in the past . Of them we can justly say that they live precisely the sixty - eight or seventy - two years allotted them on the tombstone . Of the rest , some we know to be dead , though they walk among us ; some are not yet born , though they go through the forms of life ; others are hundreds of years old though they call themselves thirty - six . The true length of a person 's life , whatever the Dictionary of National Biog305 ORLANDO raphy may say , is always a matter of dispute . Indeed it is a difficult business - this time - keeping ; nothing more quickly disorders it than contact with any of the arts ; and it may have been her love of poetry that was to blame for making Orlando lose her shopping list and start home without the sardines , the bath salts , or the boots . Now as she stood with her hand on the door of her motor car , the present again struck her on the head . Eleven times she was violently assaulted . "
86920	86972	86549	86553	a girl in Russian trousers	3128	" she cried , for it is a great shock to the nervous system , hearing a clock strike - so much so that for some time now there is nothing to be said of her save that she frowned slightly , changed her gears admirably , and cried out , as before,"Look
86978	86979	86549	86553	a girl in Russian trousers	3128	" "
86988	86989	86982	86982	you	3130	" "
86998	87125	86993	86993	you	3130	" while the motor car shot , swung , squeezed , and slid , for she was an expert driver , down Regent Street , down Haymarket , down Northumberland Avenue , over Westminster Bridge , to the left , straight on , to the right , straight on again .. The old Kent Road was very crowded on Thursday , the eleventh of October , 928 . People spilt off the pavement . There were women with shopping bags . Children ran out . There were sales at drapers ' shops . Streets widened and narrowed . Long vistas steadily shrunk together . Here was a market . Here a funeral . Here a pro306 ORLANDO cession with banners upon which was written in great letters "
87130	87439	87440	87440	Orlando	259	" but what else ? Meat was very red . Butchers stood at the door . Women almost had their heels sliced off . Amor Vin- that was over a porch . A woman looked out of a bedroom window , profoundly contemplative , and very still . Applejohn and Applebed , Undert- . Nothing could be seen whole or read from start to finish . What was seen begun - like two friends starting to meet each other across the street - was never seen ended . After twenty minutes the body and mind were like scraps of torn paper tumbling from a sack and , indeed , the process of motoring fast out of London so much resembles the chopping up small of body and mind , which precedes unconsciousness and perhaps death itself that it is an open question in what sense Orlando can be said to have existed at the present moment . Indeed we should have given her over for a person entirely disassembled were it not that here , at last , one green screen was held out on the right , against which the little bits of paper fell more slowly ; and then another was held out on the left so that one could see the separate scraps now turning over by themselves in the air ; and then green screens were held continuously on either side , so that her mind regained the illusion of holding things within itself and she saw a cottage , a farmyard and four cows , all precisely life - size . 307 ORLANDO When this happened , Orlando heaved a sigh of relief , lit a cigarette , and puffed for a minute or two in silence . Then she called hesitatingly , as if the person she wanted might not be there , "
87442	87748	87440	87440	Orlando	259	" For if there are ( at a venture ) seventy - six different times all ticking in the mind at once , how many different people are there notHeaven help us - all having lodgment at one time or another in the human spirit ? Some say two thousand and fifty - two . So that it is the most usual thing in the world for a person to say , directly they are alone , Orlando ? ( if that is one 's name ) meaning by that , Come , come ! I 'm sick to death of this particular self . I want another . Hence , the astonishing changes we see in our friends . But it is not altogether plain sailing , either , for though one may say , as Orlando said ( being out in the country and needing another self presumably ) Orlando ? still the Orlando she needs may not come ; these selves of which we are built up , one on top of another , as plates are piled on a waiter 's hand , have attachments elsewhere , sympathies , little constitutions and rights of their own , call them what you will ( and for many of these things there is no name ) so that one will only come if it is raining , another in a room with green curtains , another when Mrs. Jones is not there , another if you can promise it a glass of wine -and so on ; for everybody can multiply from his ' own experience the different terms which his different selves 308 ORLANDO have made with him - and some are too wildly ridiculous to be mentioned in print at all . So Orlando , at the turn by the barn , called"Orlando
87750	87767	87440	87440	Orlando	259	" with a note of interrogation in her voice and waited . Orlando did not come . "
87772	88266	87440	87440	Orlando	259	" Orlando said , with the good humour people practise on these occasions ; and tried another . For she had a great variety of selves to call upon , far more than we have been able to find room for , since a biography is considered complete if it merely accounts for six or seven selves , whereas a person may well have as many thousand . Choosing then , only those selves we have found room for , Orlando may now have called on the boy who cut the nigger 's head down ; the boy who strung it up again ; the boy who sat on the hill ; the boy who saw the poet ; the boy who handed the Queen the bowl of rose water ; or she may have called upon the young man who fell in love with Sasha ; or upon the Courtier ; or upon the Ambassador ; or upon the Soldier ; or upon the Traveller ; or she may have wanted the woman to come to her ; the Gipsy ; the Fine Lady ; the Hermit ; the girl in love with life ; the Patroness of Letters ; the woman who called Mar ( meaning hot baths and evening fires ) or Shelmerdine ( meaning crocuses in autumn woods ) or Bonthrop ( meaning the death we die daily ) or all three together - which meant more things than we have 309 ORLANDO space to write out - all these selves were different and she may have called upon any one of them . Perhaps ; but what appeared certain ( for we are now in the region of ' perhaps ' and ' appears ' ) was that the one she needed most kept aloof , for she was , to hear her talk , changing her selves as quickly as she drove - there was a new one at every corner - as happens when , for some unaccountable reason , the conscious self , which is the uppermost , and has the power to . desire , wishes to be nothing but one self . This is what some people call the true self , and it is , they say , compact of all the selves we have it in us to be ; commanded and locked up by the Captain self , the Key self , which amalgamates and controls them all . Orlando was certainly seeking this self as the reader can judge from overhearing her talk as she drove ( and if it is rambling talk , disconnected , trivial , dull , and sometimes unintelligible , it is the reader 's fault for listening to a lady talking to herself ; we only copy her words as she spoke them , adding in brackets which self in our opinion is speaking , but in this we may well be wrong ) . "
88273	88277	88287	88288	a woman	916	" she said . "
88825	88828	88829	88829	she	3142	" Fame ! "
88832	88866	88829	88829	she	3142	" A poet - a charlatan ; both every morning as regularly as the post comes in . To dine , to meet ; to meet , to dine ; fame - fame ! "
88945	88974	88932	88932	she	3142	" With my guineas I 'll buy flowering trees , flowering trees , flowering trees and walk among my flowering trees and tell my sons what fame is . "
89004	89015	89016	89016	she	3142	" And walk 312 ORLAN DO among my flowering trees , "

89065	89092	89062	89062	she	3142	" with a dirty ruff on .... Was it old Mr. Baker come to measure the timber ? Or was it Sh - p - re ? "
89129	89132	89133	89133	she	3142	" Haunted ! "
89141	89280	89133	89133	she	3142	" Haunted ! ever since I was a child . There flies the wild goose . It flies past the window out to sea . Up I jumped ( she gripped the steering wheel tighter ) and stretched after it . But the goose flies too fast . I 've seen it , here - there - there - England , Persia , Italy . Always it flies fast out to sea and always I fling after it words like nets ( here she flung her hand out ) which shrivel as I 've seen nets shrivel drawn on deck with only sea - weed in them . And sometimes there 's an inch of silver - six words - in the bottom of the net . But never the great fish who lives in the coral groves . "
89303	89305	89298	89298	she	3142	" Orlando "
89688	89693	89694	89694	she	3142	" Morning , James , "
89697	89712	89694	89694	she	3142	" there 're some things in the car . Will you bring 'em in ? "
90718	90724	90728	90728	she	3142	" Please do not touch , "
91920	92398	92399	92399	I	0	" Those were her words , spoken quite distinctly , but we can not conceal the fact that she was now a very indifferent witness to the truth of what was before her and might easily have mistaken a sheep for a cow , or an old man called Smith for one who was called Jones and was no relation of his whatever . For the shadow of faintness which the thumb without a nail had cast had deepened 322 ORLANDO now , at the back of her brain ( which is the part furthest from sight ) into a pool where things dwell in darkness so deep that what they are we scarcely know . She now looked down into this pool or sea in which everything is reflected - and , indeed , some say that all our most violent passions , and art and religion are the reflections which we see in the dark hollow at the back of the head when the visible world is obscured for the time . She looked there now , long , deeply , profoundly , and immediately the ferny path up the hill along which she was walking became not entirely a path , but partly the Serpentine ; the hawthorn bushes were partly ladies and gentlemen sitting with card cases and gold - mounted canes ; the sheep were partly tall Mayfair houses ; everything was partly something else , and each gained an odd moving power from this union of itself and something not itself so that with this mixture of truth and falsehood her mind became like a forest in which things moved ; lights and shadows changed , and one thing became another . Except when Canute , the elk hound , chased a rabbit and so reminded her that it must be about half past four - it was indeed twenty - three minutes to six - she forgot the time . The ferny path led , with many turns and windings , higher and higher to the oak tree , which stood on the top . The tree had grown bigger , sturdier , and more knotted 323 ORLANDO since she had known it , somewhere about the year 1588 , but it was still in the prime of life . The little sharply frilled leaves were still fluttering thickly on its branches . Flinging herself on the ground , she felt the bones of the tree running out like ribs from a spine this way and that beneath her . She liked to think that she was riding the back of the world . She liked to attach herself to something hard . As she flung herself down a little square book bound in red cloth fell from the breast of her leather jacket - her poem The Oak Tree . "
92406	92507	92399	92399	I	0	" she reflected . The earth was so shallow over the roots that it seemed doubtful if she could do as she meant and bury the book here . Besides the dogs would dig it up . No luck ever attends these symbolical celebrations , she thought . Perhaps it would be as well then to do without them . She had a little speech on the tip of her tongue which she meant to speak over the book as she buried it . ( It was a copy of the first edition , signed by author and artist . ) "
92515	92523	92399	92399	I	0	" she was going to have said , "
92537	92960	92399	92399	I	0	" but Lord ! once one began mouthing words aloud , how silly they sounded ! She was reminded of old Greene getting upon a platform the other day , comparing her with Milton ( save for his blindness ) and handing her a cheque for two hundred guineas . She had thought then of the oak tree here on its hill , and what 324 ORLANDO has that got to do with this , she had wondered ? What has praise and fame to do with poetry ? What has seven editions ( the book had already gone into no less ) got to do with the value of it ? Was not writing poetry a secret transaction , a voice answering a voice ? So that all this chatter and praise , and blame and meeting people who admired one and meeting people who did not admire one was as ill suited as could be to the thing itself - a voice answering a voice . What could have been more secret , she thought , more slow , and like the intercourse of lovers , than the stammering answer she had made all these years to the old crooning song of the woods , and the farms and the brown horses standing at the gate , neck to neck , and the smithy and the kitchen and the fields , so laboriously bearing wheat , turnips , grass , and the gardens blowing irises and fritillaries ? So she let her book lie unburied and dishevelled on the ground , and watched the vast view , varied like an ocean floor this evening with the sun lightening it and the shadows darkening it . There was a village with a church tower among elm trees ; a grey - domed manor house in a park , a spark of light burning on some glasshouse , a farmyard with yellow corn stacks . The fields were marked with black tree clumps , and beyond the fields stretched long woodlands , and there was the gleam of a river , and then hills again . In the far distance Snow325 ORLANDO don 's crags broke white among the clouds ; she saw the far Scottish hills and the wild tides that swirl about the Hebrides . She listened for the sound of gun - firing out at sea . No - only the wind blew . There was no war to - day . Drake had gone ; Nelson had gone . "
92964	92990	92992	92992	my	0	" she thought , letting her eyes , which had been looking at these far distances , drop once more to the land beneath her , "
93016	93111	93014	93014	mine	0	" Here the landscape ( it must have been some trick of the fading light ) shook itself , heaped itself , let all this encumbrance of houses , castles , and woods slide off its tent - shaped sides . The bare mountains of Turkey were before her . It was blazing noon . She looked straight at the baked hill - side . Goats cropped the sandy tufts at her feet . An eagle soared above her . The raucous voice of old Rustum , the gipsy , croaked in her ears , "
93147	93420	93144	93144	housemaids	3284	" At this moment some church clock chimed in the valley . The tent - like landscape collapsed and fell . The present showered down upon her head once more , but now that the light was fading , gentlier than before , calling into view nothing detailed , nothing small , but only 326 ORLANDO misty fields , lamps in cottage windows , the slumbering bulk of a wood , and a fan - shaped light pushing the darkness before it along some lane . Whether it had struck nine , ten , or eleven , she could not say . Night had come -night that she loved of all times , night in which the reflections in the dark pool of the mind shine more clearly than by day . It was not necessary to faint now in order to look deep into the darkness where things shape themselves and to see in the pool of the mind now Shakespeare , now a girl in Russian trousers , now a toy boat on the Serpentine , and then the Atlantic itself , where it storms in great waves past Cape Horn . There was her husband 's brig , rising to the top of the wave ! Up , it went , and up and up . The white arch of a thousand deaths rose before it . Oh rash , oh ridiculous man , always sailing , so uselessly , round Cape Horn in the teeth of a gale ! But the brig was through the arch and out on the other side ; it was safe at last ! "
93423	93427	93144	93144	housemaids	3284	" she cried , "
93430	93453	93144	93144	housemaids	3284	" And then the wind sank , the waters grew calm ; and she saw the waves rippling peacefully in the moonlight . "
93458	93665	93454	93456	Marmaduke Bonthrop Shelmerdine	257	" she cried , standing by the oak tree . The beautiful , glittering name fell out of the sky like a steel blue feather . She watched it fall , turning and twisting like a slow falling arrow that cleaves the deep 327 ORLANDO air beautifully . He was coming , as he always came , in moments of dead calm ; when the wave rippled and the spotted leaves fell slowly over her foot in the autumn woods ; when the leopard was still ; the moon was on the waters , and nothing moved between sky and sea . It was then that he came . All was still now . It was near midnight . The moon rose slowly over the weald . Its light raised a phantom castle . upon earth . There stood the great house with all its windows robed in silver . Of wall or substance there was none . All was phantom . All was still . All was lit as for the coming of a dead Queen . Gazing below her , Orlando saw dark plumes tossing in the courtyard , and torches flickering and shadows kneeling . A Queen once more stepped from her chariot . "
93675	93682	93673	93673	Ma'am	3125	" she cried , curtseying deeply . "
93700	93767	93688	93690	The dead Lord	3288	" Immediately , the first stroke of midnight sounded . The cold breeze of the present brushed her face with its little breath of fear . She looked anxiously into the sky . It was dark with clouds now . The wind roared in her ears . But in the roar of the wind she heard the roar of an aeroplane coming . nearer and nearer . "
93774	93872	93454	93456	Marmaduke Bonthrop Shelmerdine	257	" she cried , baring her breast to the moon ( which now showed bright ) so that her pearls 328 ORLANDO glowed like the eggs of some vast moon - spider . The aeroplane rushed out of the clouds and stood over her head . It hovered above her . Her pearls burnt like a phosphorescent flare in the darkness . And as Shelmerdine , now grown a fine sea captain , hale , fresh - coloured , and alert , leapt to the ground , there sprang up over his head a single wild bird . "
93878	93882	93454	93456	Marmaduke Bonthrop Shelmerdine	257	" Orlando cried . "The
