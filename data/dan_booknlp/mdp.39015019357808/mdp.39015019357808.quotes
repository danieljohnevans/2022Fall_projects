4241	4254	4264	4264	Shoogar	70	“ Lant , you are a fool . This is already serious . "
4255	4263	4451	4452	The stranger	252	" Can you handle this new magician ? ”
4462	4467	4451	4452	The stranger	252	" You are discourteous , ”
4471	4485	4451	4452	The stranger	252	“ This business can wait , surely ? ! The spell device said , “
4488	4500	4509	4509	You	0	” I landed behind the boulder . Shoogar stood his ground . “
4503	4508	4535	4535	I	0	" he repeated firmly . “
4539	4553	5034	5034	I	0	" The spell device spoke again . Its intonation was terrifying and inhuman . “
4563	5033	5034	5034	I	0	" I realized that the stranger had spoken first . His device was attempting to speak for him , but in our words . Shoogar saw it too , and was reassured . The device was only a speakerspell , and a poor one at that , despite its powerful shape . - Shoogar and the speakerspell and the stranger stood on that wind - swept mesa and talked with each other . Or rather , they talked at each other . It was infant 's talk , most of it . The thing had no words of its own . It could only use Shoogar 's ; sometimes correctly , more often not . Shoogar 's temper was not improving . He had come to demand gift or duel from an intruding warlock only to find himself teaching a simpleminded construct to talk . The stranger seemed to be enjoying himself , unfortunately at Shoogar 's expense . The red sun was long gone , the blue was near the horizon , and all the world was red - black shadow . The blue sun settled behind a clump of deep violet clouds . Suddenly it was gone , like a taper blown out by the wind . The moons emerged against the night , now in the configuration of the striped lizard . During certain configurations Shoogar 's power is higher THE FLYING SORCERERS than during others . I wondered if he were master or servant to the striped lizard . He was just drawing his robes imperiously about his squat and stubby form . Master , apparently , from his manner . Abruptly , the stranger repeated his palms - out gesture , turned , and went back to his nest . He did not go inside . Instead , he briefly touched the rim of the doorway , and there was light ! Garish light , it spurted from the flank of the nest , bright as double daylight . And such a strange light . The ground and the plants seemed to take the wrong colors and there was something not right with their shadows , an odd blackness of shade . The new magician 's motive was obvious , even to me and even more so to Shoogar . He leapt back out of the light with his arms raised for defense . But it was no use . The light followed him , swept over him and dazzled him , effectively cancelling out the strength of the lunar light . The stranger had effectively negated the power of the striped lizard . Shoogar stood trembling , a tiny figure pinned in that dazzling odd - colored glow . Then , for no apparent reason , the stranger caused the light to vanish . “
5042	5052	5058	5058	We	414	" said the speakerspell , talking for the magician . “
5067	5218	5058	5058	We	414	” I breathed more easily , but did not completely relax . This stranger had shown how easily he could cancel the effect of any lunar configuration . Any powers Shoogar might have hoped to draw from the sky would have to be foregone . I watched the striped lizard slink dejectedly into the west . The moons rode their line across the sky , milk - white crescents with thick red fringes . On successive nights the red borderlines would narrow as the suns set closer and closer together . Then there would be no colored borders . Later , blue borders would show after second sunset . . . and Shoogar could make no use of any of this ... Shoogar and the new magician were still talking . By now the speakerspell had learned enough words so that the two could intelligently discuss the matters of magicians . "
5227	5236	5254	5254	you	413	" Shoogar was 10 THE FLYING SORCERERS saying . “
5260	5261	5254	5254	you	413	” “
5266	5292	5254	5254	you	413	" echoed the speakerspell device . Still cold and cramped , I was suddenly no longer sleepy . I cocked an ear to hear better . "
5304	5308	5370	5370	You	413	" Shoogar amplified . “
5324	5325	5356	5356	Your	413	” "
5354	5355	5392	5392	you	413	" "
5402	5403	5408	5408	I	0	” "
5451	5452	5454	5454	you	413	" “
5463	5467	5474	5474	you	413	” said Shoogar . “
5479	5480	5485	5485	I	0	” “
5513	5514	5525	5525	I	0	" “
5520	5524	5530	5533	Two of my sons	416	” I protested . “
5537	5538	5530	5533	Two of my sons	416	” “
5542	5559	5625	5625	you	0	" He moved closer eagerly . I tensed , but he only wanted to examine them . “
5621	5622	5625	5625	you	0	” “
5629	5651	5625	5625	you	0	” Shoogar demanded . I was silent , seething at the insult to Wilville and Orbur 's bicycles . Primitive indeed ! “
5660	5665	5750	5750	their	421	" said the magician . “
5758	5775	5873	5873	you	0	” The speakerspell was missing half of the stranger 's words , making the rest gibberish . “
5863	5870	5873	5873	you	0	" Shoogar interrupted the babbling stranger . “
5900	5901	5904	5904	I	0	” “
5914	5926	5931	5931	you	0	” Shoogar began to fume again , but he only said , “
5933	5934	5946	5946	You	0	" “
5955	5971	5973	5973	you	0	” Shoogar drew himself up to his full height and stared up at the stranger . "
6002	6077	5973	5973	you	0	” And with that Shoogar produced a ball of fire from his sleeve and casually hurled it across the clearing . I could see that the stranger was startled . He had not expected that . The ball of fire lay sputtering on the ground , then died away leaving only the burnt core . The stranger took two steps toward it , as if to examine it , then turned back to Shoogar , “
6081	6085	6094	6094	You	0	” he said , “
6089	6093	6129	6129	you	0	" Shoogar said , “
6132	6133	6129	6129	you	0	" "
6159	6204	6129	6129	you	0	" As if to demonstrate , he touched his spell device again , and once more the red fire lashed out . Eye - searing flame played across Musk - Watz 's cairn . Another smoking hole . I winced . The stranger said , “
6226	6270	6129	6129	you	0	” I tried to conceal my reaction . Any idiot could have told 12 THE FLYING SORCERERS him the smoke was bluish - gray , let alone what rocks are made of . I could tell him myself . He was still talking , “
6294	6295	6129	6129	you	0	” “
6303	6307	6323	6323	I	0	" Shoogar exclaimed . “
6321	6322	6335	6335	I	0	” “
6328	6334	6477	6477	Shoogar	70	” the stranger said impatiently . “
6355	6476	6477	6477	Shoogar	70	” ( That was a needless insult . Shoogar may be only a magician of the second circle , but that does not mean that he is inferior . In actuality , there are few secrets he is not privy to . Besides , gaining the first circle is a matter of politics as well as skill , and Shoogar has never been known as a diplomat . ) I could see that Shoogar was fuming . It was high time that the oil of diplomacy be applied to the rough edges of these two magicians . I knew it was my duty to prevent friction between them , especially ' now that the barrier of language had been removed . “
6479	6483	6490	6491	the diplomat	424	" I said , “
6493	6509	6591	6591	I	0	” Without waiting for his assent , I approached the speakerspell , albeit somewhat nervously . "
6559	6590	6598	6598	My	0	" I felt it necessary to establish my rank from the very beginning , and my right to speak for the village . The stranger looked at me and said , “
6602	6703	6598	6598	My	0	” The speakerspell hesitated , but I counted the syllables of the name . Three . I smiled to myself , Obviously , we were dealing with a very low status individual ... and I realized something disquieting as well . Where did this magician come from , that individuals of such low status controlled such mighty magic ? I preferred not to think about that . Perhaps he had n't given his full name . After all , I had n't given him the secret side of mine . The speakerspell abruptly translated the stranger 's three syllable name , “
6713	6714	6598	6598	My	0	” “
6718	6725	6730	6737	a magician to be named for a color	427	” said Shoogar , speaking low . "
6739	6763	6730	6737	a magician to be named for a color	427	" THE FLYING SORCERERS 13 Besides , head of a gray magic is that yo master've never be to the strane secret side is “
6780	6782	6730	6737	a magician to be named for a color	427	" . "
6785	6791	6810	6810	he	428	” . Shoogar whispered back . “
6815	6816	6810	6810	he	428	" "
6829	6830	6866	6868	a gray magician	430	” “
6870	6878	6916	6916	I	0	” I turned back to the stranger , “
6896	6915	6936	6936	You	428	" He could n't be offended ; I was not asking for the name itself . He said , "
6934	6935	6947	6947	I	0	" "
6945	6946	6956	6956	my	0	” "
6960	7053	7056	7056	you	428	" . Shoogar and I exchanged a glance . The stranger was either incredibly foolish , or exceedingly cunning . Either he had betrayed his full name to us , thus delivering himself into Shoogar 's power ; or he was playing the fool in order to keep Shoogar from discovering his real name . Perhaps the name he had given was some kind of spell trap . It certainly was n't a clue to his identity . As - A - Shade - Of - Purple - Gray was speaking again . “
7060	7061	7056	7056	you	428	" "
7066	7093	7096	7096	I	0	" I started to point down the mountain , but covered the gesture quickly . No sense in telling this stranger where the village was located . "
7104	7105	7096	7096	I	0	" "
7111	7115	7119	7119	I	0	" Shoogar asked . “
7125	7134	7166	7166	I	0	" At this Shoogar 's ears perked up . "
7182	7284	7166	7166	I	0	" Indeed , Shoogar had been trying to perfect a flying spell for as long as he had been a magician . He had even contrived to get two of my sons to aid him , Wilville and Orbur . Often they would neglect their bicycle carying to work on some strange new device for him . So great was their enthusiasm for 14 THE FLYING SORCERERS Shoogar 's project that — much to my annoyance — they had been accepting no payment at all for their labors . The new magician smiled at Shoogar 's description of his flying spell . “
7287	7291	7297	7297	My	0	" he said , “
7308	7392	7419	7419	I	0	” He pointed at his huge black nest . No , he must have meant one of the devices in it , or near it . Who could conceive of a flying nest ? A nest is a home , a fixed place , a locality of refuge , a place of returning . Philosophically a nest can not so much as move , let alone fly . What is philosophically impossible is impossible to magic . This law constrains even the gods . "
7407	7418	7508	7508	Shoogar	70	" Shoogar begged excitedly . The stranger shook his head . "
7436	7505	7508	7508	Shoogar	70	" This was too much for Shoogar . All evening long , this new magician had continued to insult him . Now , he refused even to gift him with a secret . Shoogar began jumping up and down in exasperation . He pulled his tarinele from his travel kit , and had actually begun to pack the blow chambers with cursing powder before I could calm him . “
7512	7517	7571	7571	I	0	" I begged him . “
7554	7570	7623	7623	We	436	" Shoogar muttered something under his breath . He muttered a whole bunch of somethings . “
7591	7622	7631	7631	We	436	" But he emptied the blow chambers , wrapped it up again in its protective skins and returned it to his pack . He stood and faced the new magician . “
7644	7655	7656	7656	I	0	" But the stranger did not seem to hear this . “
7661	7665	7666	7666	I	0	” he said . “
7674	7687	7689	7689	you	439	” Shoogar can be clever when he puts his mind to it . “
7694	7698	7689	7689	you	439	” he said . "
7735	7766	7796	7796	I	0	” ( I wished Shoogar had n't brought that up . I remembered how far we were from home . ) THE FLYING SORCERERS 15 Shoogar spread his hands helplessly . “
7809	7810	7796	7796	I	0	” "
7816	7821	7822	7822	I	0	” said the stranger , “
7830	7831	7822	7822	I	0	” "
7834	7838	7897	7897	You	439	” said Shoogar . “
7860	7885	7897	7897	You	439	" As - A - Shade - Of - Purple - Gray seemed to laugh . I was becoming most tired of his laugh . “
7892	7896	7897	7897	You	439	” he said . “
7907	8129	7897	7897	You	439	” Shoogar and I exchanged a glance . Obviously this dumpylegged stranger would be unable to keep up with our bicycles - especially if he was going to try to bring his nest . We waited respectfully , however , while the magician collapsed his artifacts and devices . I was amazed to see how easily they folded up and how compactly they stored , and made a mental note to get closer to one of them if I could . I was curious to see how the bone was carved and how the metal was worked . Perhaps I could learn something from the construction of such devices . They were carved too precisely , too delicately for me to see much in the dim light . I glanced involuntarily at the sky . We were fast approaching the time of total darkness . Only six of the moons were left in the sky . No wonder the light was fading . I certainly did not intend to tarry for this stranger . Within a remarkably short time , the stranger had packed up all of his devices and stowed them within his nest . There was something about his manner that made me feel vaguely uneasy ; a sureness of self that implied he knew what he was doing . “
8133	8137	8138	8138	I	0	” he said . "
8142	8680	8723	8723	I	0	" and he disappeared into his nest , shutting the door behind him . That was when my feeling of unease gave way to one of pure terror . PurpleGray 's whole nest began to hum , like the speakerspell and the red - fire devices within it , but louder . Suddenly it rose into the air and hung there at twice the height of a man . It began to glow with a color we had never seen before . The plants and the trees shone like garish hallucinations . Green is a dark color - not a dreadful bright fluorescence . I thought Shoogar would fall off his bicycle from astonishment . I was having trouble with my own hands and feet . 16 THE FLYING SORCERERS Even when you are not trembling all over , a bicycle is hard enough to control . The ride back to the village was a nightmare . Shoogar was so unnerved , he forgot to chant any of his protective canteles , and we both kept looking back over our shoulders at that huge looming egg which came floating silently , dreadfully after us , throwing off light in all directions , like some terrifying manifestation of Elcin , the thunder god . It did n't help matters that every time I looked up , another moon had set , plunging us ever closer to the time of total darkness . One of us was moaning , but I was n't sure whether it was Shoogar or me . The bicycles clattered roughly down the mountain path , and I was so concerned about getting safely back to my nest that I did not even think to urge Shoogar to be careful with my other machine . The way he kept looking back over his shoulder I was sure he would hit something and split a wheel . Fortunately , he did not ; I did not know if I would even have stopped to help him . Not with that bright black egg chasing us , always keeping perfectly and terrifyingly upright . . Somehow we made it down to the grasslands . Several of the women saw us coming — they were out in the fields gathering the night fungi — but when they saw that huge glowing nest looming along behind us , they turned and ran for the safety of the village . Shoogar and I did not even think to park our bicycles on the hill , but rode them right down into the settlement . ( Well , the women would have to clean the mud from the wheels later . ) We reached the village none too soon . The last of the moons was just settling in the west . We paused , out of breath , in the center clearing . The great black nest floated ominously above us , lighting up the whole village with its odd - colored aura . The great trees and the gourd - shaped nests hanging from their mighty branches took on strange and terrifying colors . From out of the air the magician 's voice boomed louder than any natural voice , “
8726	8735	8723	8723	I	0	” he asked suddenly . THE FLYING SORCERERS 17 “
8739	8744	8723	8723	I	0	" I gasped weakly , “
8749	9136	8723	8723	I	0	" and made an appropriate arm - sweeping gesture . I looked around myself to see if we had any trees strong enough to hang such a nest from . There were none big enough that were not already occupied ; but if this magician could make his nest fly , then he could surely hang it even from a sapling . But even this the stranger did not do . He landed it on the ground . And not just on any ground . He swept through the village toward the river , and brought it to land on the crest of the slope overlooking the frog - grading ponds . The ponds were dry now , drained for their ritual purification and reseeding spells , but I was appalled at such callous disregard for the property of the village . I winced as the magician 's nest sank into the ooze with a loud squishy phloosh . I did not sleep well at all . By the time the smoky rim of the red sun began to appear over the horizon , I was already up and about . I felt better after my cleansing and purification , but still haggard and drawn . The events of the night before had taken their toll . A glance out the door of the nest was enough to confirm that the stranger was still in our midst . Pilg the Crier was already moving through the trees moaning of this new development . Disaster was all the more certain now that the strange magician had moved his nest into the village . Even from here I could see a curious crowd gathering around it — though keeping a respectful distance . Ang , the frogmonger , was wringing his hands and moaning over his frog - grading ponds . He would have to repurify them again after the stranger left , and if that were not soon , he might miss the spawning season altogether . Shoogar and I went out to watch him , that first day . As soon as he saw us he straightened from his examination of a local herb and disappeared into his nest . He returned al- 18 THE FLYING SORCERERS most immediately with an object in his outstretched hand . “
9140	9144	9150	9151	the magician	274	” he said . “
9153	9591	9639	9639	you	447	” Shoogar was caught by surprise . He had not expected the stranger to produce the required gift . Now he had fulfilled his obligation as a magician , and had the legal right to remain in the district . By the same convention , Shoogar was bound to respect the rights of the new magician as well as his spells . Guild rules are quite specific . Shoogar , as resident magician , had the seniority . The stranger could do nothing to interfere with Shoogar 's practice or previous spells ; but aside from that , he was free to do as he chose . Shoogar examined his gift . It was small and light , easily held in one hand . One end had a glass lens mounted in it . The stranger demonstrated how it worked . When one pressed forward on the thing 's sliding nerve , the glass lens made light . It was a trivial thing . I could sense that Shoogar was disappointed , and insulted that the stranger had not given him something more spectacular . Shoogar had other ways to make cold light . But there was little he could say . It is extremely bad form to test a gift spell in the presence of the giver . The only advantage to the gift was that its light was of a shape we had not seen before . By twisting a knob on one side the shape could be varied from a bright narrow beamlike the stranger 's red - fire device , but nowhere near as damaging — to a broad glare , wide enough to illuminate half a countryside . Using the sliding nerve , the brightness of the device could be adjusted too . It could be muted down to a dim glow , no brighter than a lightmoss , or it could be pushed up until it was too bright to look at . Purple - Gray advised Shoogar not to use the spell too much in this latter form , or its something would drain away too fast . The speakerspell did n't translate the word . Shoogar turned it over and over in his hands . He had had his heart set on the flying spell or the red fire device . Yet manners compelled him to accept this gift graciously , I could see he wanted to ask for something else , but could n't figure out how to do so without the risk of offending the other magician . THE FLYING SORCERERS 19 Purple - Gray was saying , “
9650	9668	9765	9765	You	447	” Much of it was like that : coherent sentences trailing off into strings of unrelated words . “
9727	9764	9765	9765	You	447	" Shoogar waited through this stream of gibberish with commendable patience . Purple - Gray 's words about different colors seemed to hint at something very important , and Shoogar wanted to know what it was . “
9771	9775	9801	9801	My	0	” he said . “
9786	9796	9818	9818	My	0	” I wondered if Shoogar was baiting the stranger . "
9803	9817	9827	9827	I	0	" He looked up , considered , then pointed into the empty sky . “
9835	9836	9827	9827	I	0	" “
9840	9859	9827	9827	I	0	” Shoogar peered up into the sky . I looked also . So did the crowd of onlookers . “
9863	9884	9986	9986	Shoogar	70	” The sky was an empty blue . What was he talking about ? Shoogar looked at the other magician , “
9909	9910	9986	9986	Shoogar	70	" "
9917	9923	9986	9986	Shoogar	70	” said Purple - Gray . "
9934	9980	9986	9986	Shoogar	70	" Shoogar raised an eyebrow — threw me a look - turned back to the other magician . I could sense some of the onlookers trying to restrain their mirth . Some of the lesser women were already giggling and had to be herded away . "
9988	9995	10023	10025	Purple - Gray	108	“ Too small . . . ? "
10013	10021	10023	10025	Purple - Gray	108	" Oh , no — you misunderstand , ”
10028	10042	10048	10048	Shoogar	70	" It 's too small to see because it 's so far away . "
10043	10046	10051	10053	Purple - Gray	108	“ Oh ... ”
10067	10104	10133	10133	I	0	“ Yes . In fact , it 's so far away that if you tried to get there on say , a bicycle , it would take you many generations . You That was he kers : "
10131	10132	10133	10133	I	0	" “
10139	10143	10133	10133	I	0	" said Shoogar . “
10155	10161	10174	10174	I	0	” Purple - Gray laughed , “
10176	10184	10289	10290	1 ...	461	” The speakerspell hesitated , then said , “
10189	10256	10289	10290	1 ...	461	" Shoogar shook his head in confusion . Several more of the women had to be led away . It was not good for them to see a grown man making a fool of himself , nor was it advisable that they witness Shoogar discomfited . Several of the men began muttering among themselves . Shoogar gestured for silence — he still had not given up . “
10263	10267	10289	10290	1 ...	461	” he asked . “
10276	10277	10289	10290	1 ...	461	” “
10296	10328	10289	10290	1 ...	461	" Shoogar repeated this sentence slowly , to see if there was something in it he had missed . There was n't . He looked at Purple and shook his head . “
10332	10342	10289	10290	1 ...	461	" he said . That was all , just , “
10346	10531	10289	10290	1 ...	461	” Then he turned and walked away , up the slope , shaking his head and turning the small light - making device over and over in his hands . Purple - Gray spent the next several days collecting small plants , pieces of larger plants , handfuls of mud and water and dirt . There were plenty of sprats and adults to watch him , but he took little notice of them . A floating three - legged clicking device followed him about with its legs folded , unnoticed and untended until he needed it . Each time he took a sample of something he would mount this device on its legs and point it at the site . It seemed a harmless enough testing device , but Shoogar would grit his teeth every time it came floating by . Shoogar went into seclusion then , determined to discover THE FLYING SORCERERS the secret of the stranger 's light - making device . When I visited him for the purpose of checking his progress , he glared angrily at me , and muttered , "
10537	10538	10573	10573	I	0	” "
10558	10571	10598	10598	I	0	” Shoogar gave me another look , more scathing than the first . “
10620	10621	10598	10598	I	0	" "
10624	10628	10638	10638	Purple	108	" I suggested , “
10654	10655	10661	10661	his	108	" "
10664	10668	10674	10674	I	0	” Shoogar demanded . “

10692	10693	10729	10729	you	71	" “

10824	10828	10844	10844	I	0	” I said . “
10840	10841	10844	10844	I	0	" “
10846	10850	10844	10844	I	0	” said Shoogar . “

10871	10872	10874	10874	you	0	" “
10887	10911	10962	10962	Wilville	79	” Shoogar 's look and tone made it clear that he felt he was talking to an imbecile . I stiffened my tone . "
10955	10961	10992	10992	they	474	” 22 - THE FLYING SORCERERS “
10982	10983	10989	10989	I	0	” “

11063	11070	11076	11076	yourself	0	” Shoogar gave me a look . “

11221	11232	11286	11286	we	484	" My surprise must have shown , for he said , “
11330	11331	11286	11286	we	484	” “
11336	11337	11286	11286	we	484	” “

11369	11370	11413	11413	Lant	71	” “
11374	11378	11413	11413	Lant	71	" said Shoogar . “
11447	11448	11413	11413	Lant	71	" "
11457	11458	11512	11512	Lant	71	” “
11550	11562	11738	11738	I	0	” I started to answer , but he cut me off . “
11733	11737	11747	11747	I	0	” I shrugged . “
11751	11755	11775	11775	I	0	” Shoogar nodded . “
11768	11774	11775	11775	I	0	” I shook my head . “
11780	11781	11775	11775	I	0	” “
11787	11788	11775	11775	I	0	" “
11791	11795	11897	11897	you	71	" I said . “
11934	11995	11897	11897	you	71	” I shook my head . Shoogar made a very convincing case . Certainly , he had already given the whole matter much more thought than I had imagined . But , of course , that was his job as magician . It was reassuring to know that he was doing it so well . I beamed proudly at him , “
12010	12014	12023	12023	Lant	71	” Shoogar nodded , “
12025	12026	12023	12023	Lant	71	” "
12043	12048	12051	12051	you	252	" Shoogar nodded again . “
12065	12069	12051	12051	you	252	” I exclaimed . “
12081	12082	12051	12051	you	252	” “
12095	12096	12051	12051	you	252	" "

12122	12234	12236	12236	you	252	” He waved his hand at a workbench . On it were only four pieces , the elements of the stranger 's light . These consisted of a hollow shell , a crystal lens , a flat plate and an interior canister , roughly the same shape as the outer shell . Shoogar turned this flat bulging object over and over in his hands , but he could not find an opening . It was hard and solid and we both puzzled over what it might contain . It resisted all of our attempts to open it , and Shoogar would not use force for fear of destroying the devices within . “
12250	12254	12258	12258	I	0	” I prompted . “
12265	12266	12278	12278	It	497	" “

12292	12325	12328	12330	THE FLYING SORCERERS	264	" Shoogar glumly fitted the pieces together again as I watched . He activated the sliding nerve . Nothing happened . He twisted the turning knob back and forth . Still nothing . “
12334	12338	12356	12356	I	0	” he muttered . “
12360	12361	12365	12365	you	252	” “
12372	12381	12387	12387	you	252	” I suggested . Shoogar whirled on me , “
12402	12404	12417	12417	you	70	" . “
12409	12413	12448	12448	he	108	” I protested . “
12454	12459	12470	12470	you	252	" Shoogar considered this . “
12480	12492	12495	12495	I	0	" He peered at me . Hastily , I reassured him , "
12506	12513	12523	12523	Purple	108	" This seemed to placate him , “
12534	12642	12668	12668	you	70	” We found Purple out in the west pasture , doing something with a set of his devices . I looked for , but did not see the red - fire throwing device . Apparently , he had not brought it with him . The devices he was using here in the meadow all seemed to be rather harmless . Purple was puttering contentedly , murmuring and humming busily to himself when Shoogar interrupted and handed him the device . Purple took it , fiddled with it several times , then opened it and examined the cylinder within . He noted that its surface had gone red . “
12657	12662	12681	12681	I	0	" Shoogar went pale . “
12691	12692	12681	12681	I	0	" “
12697	12704	12712	12712	I	0	” said Purple with a laugh . “
12710	12711	12712	12712	I	0	” "
12718	12722	12793	12793	me	0	” said Shoogar . “
12782	12790	12807	12807	It	506	” Purple managed to check his laughter , “
12818	12819	12807	12807	It	506	” “
12822	12826	12807	12807	It	506	” said Shoogar . “
12831	12843	12866	12866	You	70	” He smoothed his fur and said in a calmer tone , "
12860	12865	12880	12880	I	0	” Again Purple laughed , “
12887	12903	12906	12906	you	0	” He reached for the device , but Shoogar did not give it to him . "
12915	12919	12981	12982	No gods	508	" demanded Shoogar . “
12978	12980	12981	12982	No gods	508	" - “
12984	12988	13015	13015	I	0	” said Purple . “
13020	13030	13049	13049	Shoogar	70	” Shoogar jerked his hand back as if stung . “
13045	13046	13049	13049	Shoogar	70	” "
13051	13055	13078	13078	you	0	" Purple said . “
13069	13076	13091	13092	This one	512	" Shoogar said slowly , carefully , “
13089	13090	13111	13111	Purple	108	" "
13103	13110	13145	13145	I	0	” Shoogar gently stiffened his tone . “
13149	13150	13145	13145	I	0	" "
13156	13160	13220	13220	you're	108	” Purple interrupted , “
13229	13236	13220	13220	you're	108	” Abruptly , he was silent . “
13241	13245	13281	13281	Purple	108	” Shoogar asked . “
13253	13280	13281	13281	Purple	108	" the other replied . THE FLYING SORCERERS 27 onversation they hint your dev Shoogar looked thoughtfully at the device he still held in his hands . “
13283	13296	13350	13350	I	0	” he began slowly and evenly ; his voice showed great control . “
13342	13349	13423	13423	you	70	” He paused , then said , “
13403	13421	13423	13423	you	70	" He paused again ; it was very hard for him to say what he said next , “
13427	13473	13423	13423	you	70	" Shoogar 's words startled me . I had never heard him so humble . His passion for the secrets of the stranger must have been all - consuming for him to debase himself like that . Purple looked at Shoogar for a long moment , “
13476	13484	13516	13517	the gods	3132	" he said , almost to himself . \“Yes
13530	13534	13516	13517	the gods	3132	” Shoogar nodded , “
13543	13544	13516	13517	the gods	3132	" "
13547	13551	13553	13553	you	70	” said Purple . “

13611	13617	13688	13688	Leeb	90	” Purple cut him off . “
13695	13712	13720	13720	Shoogar	70	" Shoogar frowned , but he nodded . He was trying very hard to follow this . "
13722	13727	13756	13756	Your	70	" said Purple condescendingly . “
13766	13781	13816	13816	Shoogar	70	" He saw that Shoogar was frowning and 28 THE FLYING SORCERERS said quickly , “
13794	13798	13866	13866	I	0	” Shoogar nodded . “
13852	13863	13944	13944	you	70	" Shoogar flinched at this , but he said nothing . “
13902	13911	13919	13919	you	70	" And here , the speakerspell hesitated again , “
13928	13929	13919	13919	you	70	” "
13932	13936	13944	13944	you	70	” said Shoogar . “

14051	14070	14073	14073	men	294	" Shoogar started to open his mouth to protest , but he Swallowed mightily and croaked out instead , “

14329	14334	14336	14336	we	546	” prompted Shoogar impatiently . "

14409	14417	14431	14431	I	0	” A red - faced Shoogar cried . “

14438	14447	14449	14449	you	0	” And that 's when Shoogar got mad . “
14455	14459	14503	14506	the God of Thunder	548	” he began . “
14474	14483	14503	14506	the God of Thunder	548	” His voice rose to a fearful pitch . "
14513	14573	14591	14591	I	0	” They were only epithets , nothing more , but coming from Shoogar they were enough to pale even me , an innocent bystander . I wondered if my hair would fall out from witnessing such a display of anger . Purple was unmoved — and I must credit him for his courage in the face of such fury . "
14597	14603	14591	14591	I	0	” Shoogar took another breath . “
14619	14673	14591	14591	I	0	" And Shoogar produced from the folds of his robe a doll . I knew from its odd proportions and colors that the doll had been carved to represent Purple . Purple did not even quail , as any normal man would have done . I knew then that he must be mad . “
14677	14681	15101	15101	Elcin	84	” he said . “
14746	15100	15110	15110	I	0	” Purple bent back to his devices , did something to one of them , a stabbing gesture with a single forefinger , and a whole section of the west pasture erupted . Shoogar covered his eyes in despair . Purple had just violated one of the finest pastures of the village one of the favorite pastures of Rotn'bair , the god of sheep . Who knew what the mutton would taste like this winter ? Then , to add injury to insult , Purple began gathering up fragments of the meadow and putting them into little containers . He was taking the droppings ! Was it possible for one man to violate so many of the basic laws of magic and still survive ? The laws of magic are strict . Any fool can see them in operation every day -even I am familiar with them - they operate the entire world , and their workings are simple and obvious . But Purple , this man of the flying nest was blind even to the simplest of spells ! I was not surprised when Shoogar , grimly intent , set the doll down on the grass and set it afire . Neither was I surprised when the doll had burnt itself into a pinch of white ash without Purple even bothering to notice . Purple ignored it — and us ; he showed not the slightest effect . Flaming sting things ! What powers this magician must have ! Shoogar stared at him aghast . How dare he not be affected ! Purple 's very casualness was the ultimate insult . When we left him he had one of his clicking boxes open and was fumbling inside . He never even noticed us leaving . Shougars were so was propose its faqes canne Shoogar was peering into the sky , a frown on his face . Both suns were still high ; broad red disc and blue - white point . The blue sun was poised on the edge of the red , ready to begin the long crawl across its face . "
15105	15109	15175	15175	Quells	93	” he muttered . “
15139	15148	15175	15175	Quells	93	” He hurled a fireball across the clearing . “
15157	15171	15240	15240	you	93	" He put his hands on his hips and shouted into the sky , “
15206	15229	15256	15256	Lant	71	" But there was no answer . I do n't think Shoogar expected one . He turned back to his spell devices . “
15261	15299	15256	15256	Lant	71	” and he thrust a large pack at me . He continued to rummage through his equipment , all the while muttering under his breath . A fearful collection of cursing devices began to grow around him . “
15306	15335	15352	15352	Lant	71	" I indicated the pile . He appeared not to hear me , continued checking off items in his head , then began loading them into the pack . "
15342	15351	15356	15357	a fool	3005	” I repeated . Shoogar looked at me , “
15361	15370	15391	15391	I	0	” he said and hefted his kit meaningfully , “
15389	15390	15356	15357	a fool	3005	" "
15401	15405	15356	15357	a fool	3005	” I asked . “
15434	15661	15356	15357	a fool	3005	” He strode purposefully toward the frog - grading ponds . I hurried after him ; it was amazing how fast Shoogar 's squat little legs could carry him . There was already an uneasy crowd of villagers standing on the rise above the flying nest . None dared approach it . When Shoogar appeared , an excited murmur ran through the crowd — the word of Purple 's insult had spread quickly ; the villagers were tense with expectation . Shoogar ignored them . He pushed through the milling throng and strode angrily to Purple 's nest , ignoring the mud that splashed up and over his ankles and stained the hem of his robe . He strode around that nest three times without pause , looking at it from all sides . I was unsure whether he had already started spelling , or whether he was just sizing up the situation . For a long moment he stood looking at the 32 THE FLYING SORCERERS landward side of that nest , like an artist contemplating a blank skin . Then , abruptly , he made up his mind . He stepped quickly forward and with a piece of chalk he inscribed the sign of the horned box on the side of Purple 's nest . An interested murmur of speculation rose from the crowd , “
15670	18082	15356	15357	a fool	3005	" This spell would be under the domain of Rotn'bair , the sheep god . Members of the crowd discussed it busily amongst themselves . Rotn'bair is neither very powerful nor very irritable . Most of the Rotn'- bairic spells deal with fertility and food gathering . Few things will anger the sheep god ; but if Rotn'bair could be angered , Shoogar would know how . The crowd buzzed with an excited curiosity , each speculating on just what form the final spell would take . Shoogar finished the sketch . Absent - mindedly wiping the chalk from his hands , he strode down to the mudbanks of the river . He paced back and forth along its edge , casting about for something . Abruptly he spotted what he was looking for , something just below the surface of the water . He grabbed quickly for it , his hands dipping into the river with no splash at all . When he straightened , the sleeves of his robe were dripping , but there was a brownish - looking slug in his grasp , and after a moment I caught the repellent odor of mudskunk . The scent reached the rest of the crowd at the same time , and a murmur of approval went up from them . The antipathy between Rotn'bair , the sheep god , and Nils'n , the god of the mud creatures , was known even to laymen . Evidently Shoogar was constructing a spell that would play on the mutual antipathy of the two gods . My guess was right - I pride myself on a fairly good understanding of the basic principles of magic - Shoogar slit the belly of the mudskunk and deftly extracted its anger gland . He placed this into a bone bowl . I recognized the bowl , having carved and cleansed it for him myself . It was made from the skull of a newborn lamb and had been sanctified to Rotn'bair . Now he was defiling it with the most odious portion of the mud creature . No doubt , he now had Rotn'bair 's attention . He laid this to one side and returned to the mudskunk which lay writhing in a swampy pool . He picked it up and dery guess # pathy of the structing known evenind Nils'n , The THE FLYING SORCERERS 33 deftly sliced off its head without even offering up a prayer for its soul . Thus he defiled its death . Now , he had Nils'n 's attention . Using the bladder of the slug as a mixing bag , he began to construct a potion of powdered ramsbone , extract of hunger , odeur of sheepsblood , and several other elements that I could not identify ; but I suspected that all of them were designed to arouse the wrath of Nils'n , although in what manner was not yet clear . Shoogar surveyed the nest of the mad magician on its riverward side . Then he began to paint his soupy potion in broad lines across its black flank in a pattern of eleven stripes by eleven . Having finished , he sketched in the sign of the deformed changeling , the favored son of the sheep god . This half of the spell would anger Nils'n . Shoogar had defiled a mud creature in order to celebrate the greatness of Rotn'bair . To complete the other half of the spell , Shoogar would now desecrate his earlier celebration of Rotn'bair , the horned box sketched on the other side of the nest . He returned to the bone bowl , the one containing the anger gland of the mudskunk , and using the leg bone of a ram , he crushed the gland into a sick - smelling paste . This he mixed with ramsblood , defiled water and a greenish powder from his travel kit . I recognized that powder - it was an extract of fear , usually used where potent action is desired . It is derived from animals of the cloven hoof . Six sheep must have been sacrificed just to provide the small amount Shoogar was now mixing into his spell . Stepping to the landward ' side of the nest , and chanting a song of praise for Nils'n , Shoogar began painting a familiar symbol across the chalk sketch of the horned box . It was the sign of Nils'n , a diagonal slash with an empty circle on either side . The crowd gasped appreciatively . Such originality in spellcasting was a delight to behold . No wonder he was called Shoogar the Tall . Rotn'bair would not allow such a desecration of his sheep to exist for long . And Nils'n , the god of mud creatures , would not long be complacent while mud - skunks were being sacrificed to Rotn'bair . The antipathy of the two gods is demonstrated every time the sheep are led to the river . Sheep are careless and clumsy . 34 THE FLYING SORCERERS As they mill about on the banks , they trample scores of frogs , snakes , salamanders , lizards , chameleons , and other amphibians that live in the mud . At the same time many of the more dangerous mud creatures , the poisonous ones , the fanged ones , the ones with venom lash back at the sheep , cutting their legs , ruining their wool , infecting them with parasites , giving them festering sores , leaving them bleeding from angry cuts and slashes . The two gods hate each other , and in their various incarnations , as sheep and mud creatures , they work to destroy each other at every opportunity . Now Shoogar had inscribed insults to both upon the same nest . He had defiled creatures of each in order to celebrate the greatness of the other . If Purple did not make immediate amends , he would have to suffer the wrath of both simultaneously . Purple had said he did not believe in the gods . He denied their existence . He denied their powers . And he had stated that he was above Shoogar 's magic . I hoped he would return in time to see the spell take effect . I followed Shoogar down to the river , and helped him with his ritual purification . He had to cleanse himself of the odeurs of offense against the gods , lest he be caught up in his own curse . Sometimes the gods are nearsighted . We bathed him with six different oils before we even let him step into the river . ( No sense in offending Filfo - mar , the river god . ) Even before we finished with the cleansing we could hear the curse beginning . We could hear the cheers of the crowd ; and beneath that was a dull sort of booming . Shoogar wrapped his robe around himself and hurried back up the hill , me trailing excitedly in his wake . W e reached the crest of the hill in time to see an angry ram butting his head insistently against the side of Purple 's nest . More rams were arriving , and they too began to attack the looming black globe . The focus of their anger was the THE FLYING SORCERERS 35 desecrated homage to Rotn'bair , and it seemed as if the very substance of the Nils'n symbol was enough to anger them . The smell of the mudskunk was potent enough to raise anyone 's hackles . Red - eyed and breathing heavily , the rams jostled and shoved and butted even at each other in their frenzy to attack that odious desecration on the side of Purple 's nest . Each time they struck it , that same dreadful booming echoed up and down the hill , and each time a great cheer went up from the crowd . I expected at any moment to see one of the rams go crashing through the walls of that fearful nest , but no those walls were stronger than I had thought . Perhaps even as strong as metal . The only effect I could see was that each time a ram struck it , it seemed to lift slightly out of the mud for a moment before sinking wetly back . Bleating in frenzy , the rams raged at that offensive spot- they were the living incarnation of Rotn'bair 's anger . Again and again , they hurled themselves at that dull black surface . Old Khart , the lead ram , had shattered both of his horns ( sacred items in themselves — I mourned the loss ) , and several of the other rams were also injured . Their eyes were red with fury , their nostrils flared wide ; their breath came in hot puffs of steam and the sounds of bleating and snorting filled the air with a madness born of wrath . The steam rose from their sides ; their hoofs slashed wetly through the ground , churning the grass and mud into a meaningless soup . Some of the rams were having trouble with their footing already , and indeed , as we watched , one of the older ones slipped and slid through the mud . He crashed against two others and brought them both down with him ; all three were caught under the frenzied slashing hooves of the others . Their angry snorts were punctuated by grunts of pain , and by the dull thud and hollow boom that rolled up and down the slope each time they struck the side of Purple 's nest . But the creatures had strength beyond all natural endurance , and continued to clamber over one another , butting at that offending spell . And each time they did so , each time they struck it , the nest rose up out of the ground and threatened to slide down the slope and into the river ; but each time it would pause and 36 THE FLYING SORCERERS then sag wetly back into its hollowed out cradle of mud . Several times it trapped slow - footed beasts under the curve of its wall . I felt a great surge of emotion within myself any moment now Purple 's great egg - shaped nest would be toppled onto its side . Then , abruptly , three of the rams hit the nest at the same time , and it seemed to leap into the air . One more struck it at just the right instant , and as it rose out of its hollow it just seemed to keep on moving . Suddenly it was sliding downslope with a great wet slosh . Angry rams scrambled after it , butting at it all the way down , churning the mud with their hoofs and leaving a long angry scar through Ang 's carefully terraced frog - grading pools . I shouted in triumph with the rest . The great black globe struck the river with a resounding smack and splash ; a loud cheer of delight went up from the villagers . Only I was silent , for the terrible nest had not deviated even a thumbnail 's width from its perfectly upright position . Had Shoogar noticed too ? His puzzled frown was a match for mine . But the nest was in the river ! The rams slid and skidded down the slope , destroying what was left of the frog pools in the process . Almost joyfully they leapt into the water , still butting at Purple 's nest . Others milled around the banks , churning the mud . Mudskunks and salamanders ran panic - stricken under their hoofs and a new shade of red added itself to the stains on the heaving flanks of the crazed rams . Crushed mud - skunk mingled with the blood of the sheep , and the terrible smell reached us on the crest of the hill along with the hysterical splashing and bleating . Now the black nest was within Nils'n 's reach . So far only Rotn'bair had had a chance to avenge the insult . Now the banks boiled with life as salamanders , lizards , crabs , venombearing snakes and other river creatures came swarming up out of the mud and darkness . They scrambled across the churning surface and attacked anything that moved , even each other , but more often the rams . The rams continued to charge the nest , oblivious to the mud creatures caught in their wool , hanging from their sides , biting and slashing at their legs . Their once proud flanks , now THE FLYING SORCERERS 37 torn and slashed , were stained with angry strokes of red and great washes of muddy brown river water . It was an awe - inspiring sight , sheep and mud creatures together attacking that ominous unmoving sphere . The villagers stood on the flanks of the hill and cheered the frenzied activity below . One or two of the braver shepherds tried to work their way down the slope , but the snapping claws of the mud crabs drove them quickly back up to the crest . The rams were slowing down now , but still they continued to mill about Purple 's nest still they continued to push at it , occasionally clambering over the body of a fallen comrade . The water was pink . Angry mud - skunks swarmed along both banks of the river . It was a heartening sight . The crowd continued to cheer wildly , and began to chant a chorus of praise to Shoogar . Pilg the Crier was leading them . Down below , their anger spent , some of the rams were already climbing back up the hill , slipping and skidding in their own blood and falling back down the mud - slicked surface . Two or three slipped beneath the water and failed to surface . The mud creatures too were beginning to calm a nd the shepherds once more dared to work their way carefully down the slopes to tend their wounded flock . "
18089	18094	15356	15357	a fool	3005	" I congratulated him , "
18100	18153	15356	15357	a fool	3005	” Indeed , as the churning foam of the river continued to · subside , revealing the full extent of the devastation , several of the villagers even began to mutter that perhaps the spell had been a bit too powerful . One of the members of the Guild of Advisors remarked , “
18166	18167	15356	15357	a fool	3005	" “
18170	18176	15356	15357	a fool	3005	” I confronted the man , “
18185	18186	15356	15357	a fool	3005	” "
18189	18193	18206	18206	He	70	" he amended , “
18214	18565	18838	18838	Fascinating	101	” I nodded . I would accept that . At least eleven of our sheep lay dead in the churned mud of the slope , mud creatures feeding indiscriminately on their stilled or still heaving flanks . Four of the rams were trampled into the landscape ; others lay with their heads at 38 THE FLYING SORCERERS oddly twisted angles , their necks broken from butting against Purple 's nest . Three more bodies lay below the water with their mouths open . What remained of the flock would show countless mudskunk bites upon their legs and flanks . Many of those bites would undoubtedly become festering sores and probably more of the rams would die later . The vermin of the mud would be vicious for days to come . It would not be safe to bathe for a while , and probably the sheep would not dare to return to the river for a long time ; they would have to be led to the mountain streams to drink . The frog - grading ponds had been completely obliterated and would have to be completely resculptured elsewhere . Ang stood moaning and wringing his hands as he surveyed his mud - churned slope . And finally , the wreck of the mad magician 's nest now blocked the river . Dammed water spilled over the south bank in a torrent . Already it was carving a new course for itself . And none of it mattered . These were all small prices to pay for the damage done to the stranger . Considering the magnitude of the task , it was one of Shoogar 's less expensive efforts and we were proud of him . Then why was the scene so utterly silent ? I looked to my left and saw Purple standing on the crest of the bill . TT He stood there with his devices floating behind . Every eye was on him . His hands were on his hips as he looked thoughtfully down at his nest . How long had be been standing there ? “
18568	18837	19202	19202	I	0	" he said . And he started briskly down the slope . His devices followed . The nest sat like a great egg in the middle of the river . Water backed up behind it , flowed in great torrents past its THE FLYING SORCERERS 39 bulging flank , splashed angrily up and over the trampled shore . Angry mud creatures clambered over its dull black surface , scratching determinedly at the spell designs . Gobbets of mud and bloody fur streaked its sides , but still the spells of Shoogar were visible , almost etched into its surface . It stood perfectly , almost arrogantly upright . That made me uneasy . My eyes searched for the dents in the stranger 's ruined nest , the dents surely put there by the horns of the rams . I could n't find them .. Purple strode straight down the slope and into the water . Not a droplet of mud stuck to those peculiar boots of his - in contrast to Shoogar 's legs and mine , which were mud to the hip . A pair of mud - skunks attacked the magician as he entered the water . Purple ignored them ; and they could n't seem to get a grip on his boots . He stood under the bulge of the nest , and we waited for his scream of fury . Carefully , with a small edged tool , he began scraping off bits of Shoogar 's curse signs and putting them into small transparent containers . His mindless speakerspell continued to translate his ramblings . "
18880	19201	19202	19202	I	0	" Twice he sniffed at what he had scraped off , and twice muttered a word the speakerspell did not translate . When he finished , he dipped his hands in the river to wash them , incidentally offending Filfo - mar , the usually gentle river god . Purple turned to the egg - shaped door of his nest ; it was flush with the curved wall , but outlined in orange to make it visible . He punched at a square pattern of bumps on the nest . The door slid open and Purple disappeared inside . We waited . Would he continue to occupy his nest , living in the middle of our defiled river ? The flying nest hummed and rose twenty feet into the air . I screamed with the rest , a wordless scream of rage . The Dest turned in an instant from black to silver ; and it must have become terribly slippery , for every particle of mud and blood and potion from Shoogar 's spell slid down the sides , formed a glob at the bottom of the nest and dropped in a lump into the river . 40 THE FLYING SORCERERS The nest turned black . It moved horizontally across the land and dropped gently to the ground — just a few yards west of where it had stood an hour ago . Only now it rested at the edge of a region of churned mud where the rams and mud creatures had fought to destroy it . I could see Shoogar sag where he stood . And I feared for my village , and for Shoogar 's sanity and my own . If Shoogar could not defend us from the mad magician , then we were all doomed . There was an angry rumble from the villagers as Purple emerged from his nest . Purple frowned and said , “
19214	19969	19977	19977	Shoogar	70	" Somebody threw a spear at him . I could n't blame the lad . No sound , no pattern of mere words could properly have answered the magician . But the young man , enraged beyond sanity , had hurled his bone spear at the stranger 's back- without a blessing ! It struck Purple hard in the back and bounced off to the side without penetrating . Purple toppled , not like a man , but like a statue . I had the irrational conviction that for a single instant Purple had become as hard as stone . But the instant was over . Immediately he was climbing to his feet . The spear , of course , had done no harm at all . One can not attack a magician with an unblessed spear . The boy would have to be brought before the Guild of Advisors . If the village survived that long . I he suns rose together , the blue sun silhouetted off - center within the other 's great fuzzy - edged and crimson disk . I woke at noon . The evacuation was already well under way . My wives and spratlings had already done a good deal of the packing , though the fear of disturbing my sleep had slowed them somewhat . With my supervision , however , and the necessary discipline , the packing progressed quickly . Even so , we were very nearly the last family to leave the village . THE FLYING SORCERERS bong as no this was a real declar The lower rim of the red sun was already near the mountains when I dropped behind the procession of my wives to tarry at Shoogar 's nest . Shoogar looked tired , but curiously determined . His eyes were alive and dancing , and his fingers moved with a life of their own , weaving spell knots into a leather strap . I knew better than to speak to him while he was in the midst of a duel . For though no formal declaration had yet been made by Purple , this was a duel . Perhaps Purple thought that so long as no duel was declared , Shoogar would sit peacefully by and allow him to continue with his duel - mongering actions . But I knew Shoogar better than that . The fierce glow burning in his eyes confirmed what and all of the rest of the villagers already knew : that Shoogar would not rest until there was one less magician in the village . I hurried on after my wives , Burdened as we were , we would be traveling well into the night . I had even removed the hobbles from my women so that they could travel faster ; it would not do to underestimate the seriousness of the situation . By the time the moons were overhead , we had reached our destination . Most of the families of the village were settled on the steppes to the north , a series of long sloping rises that overlooked the river and the cluster of housetrees that marked our village . The encampment was a sprawling place of lean - tos and tents , smoky campfires and shrill women , milling groups of men and boys . Already scavengers were rooting busily underfoot ; even before we had selected a campsite , many of my own spratlings had melted away into the bustle . Although it was well into the night , few slept . The eerie glow of the moons gave us a twilight neither red nor blue , but ghostly gray - a strange half - real quality for the waiting time before the next step of the duel . An almost festive air pervaded the settlement . From somewhere in the bachelor 's section came the brawling chant of a game of rolling bones , and an occasional cry of triumph as one of the players scored a particularly difficult pass . It does not take much to please the lower classes . An unpleasant surprise awaited us in the morning . Hinc and I were standing at the edge of the encampment , looking down the slope toward the village , discussing the forthcoming duel , when we heard a dull distant slam , like a single cough from Elcin 's throat . We looked down to see a tremendous plume of black smoke wafting through the village treetops . “
19972	19976	19977	19977	Shoogar	70	” said Hinc . “

20029	20036	20047	20047	I	0	" noted Hinc . I nodded , "

20111	20169	20106	20106	They	562	” He was right , of course , but before I could speak , we were interrupted by a crowd of frightened women running hysterically through the encampment as fast as their hobbled legs would carry them . They were screaming Purple 's name . I caught up with and cuffed my number three wife to attention . “
20177	20182	20194	20194	He	3281	” ' I demanded . “
20189	20193	20205	20207	The mad magician	3281	” she cried . "

20245	20359	20548	20548	Lant	71	” Had the man no self - respect at all ? Talking to women ? Even from the mad magician I found this hard to believe . I strode purposefully through the crowd , now milling nervously others . Tas y right , of courowa oferi 42 THE FLYING SORCERERS 43 The Pusly : Pile we d along spring , somet attentionen , men in about , women comforting other hysterical women , men interrogating their wives , sprats crying for attention . As I moved toward the spring , some of the men caught up with , and followed along behind me . They were muttering nervously . Pilg was moaning loudly , "
20374	20547	20644	20644	Lant	71	" It was as the women had said . Purple had brought his nest to a spot just above the encampment , near the spring the women had chosen for washing . The great black egg - shape was closed , and the magician was nowhere to be seen . The others waited only long enough to see that the women had spoken the truth . Then they turned and fled quickly back to the settlement . Hinc and I exchanged a wordless glance . Why had Purple followed us ? Was he fleeing from his duel ? I had never heard of such a thing before . What did he want of the villagers ? I circled the nest warily . It looked much as it had on the fearful night that I first saw it . I crept closer . There , lightly pressed into the dust , were the imprints of Purple 's strangely shaped boots . But where was Purple now ? Suddenly , that booming hollow voice . "
20559	20643	20644	20644	Lant	71	” This was too much for Hinc . He turned and disappeared down the slope after the others . I ached to join him , but I had to find out what the magician was up to . The door to the nest slid open and Purple stepped out , his strange paunchy shape oddly disquieting - he had a fearful grin on his bare face and advanced toward me as if I were an old friend ; his speakerspell drifted along behind . “
20646	20653	20644	20644	Lant	71	” he said , moving closer , “
20675	20750	20644	20644	Lant	71	” I looked at him curiously . Could it be that he did not know of the duel ? Was it possible for anyone to be that naive ? Well , so much the better- his liability was Shoogar 's asset . I certainly would not tell him . Why should a layman be concerned with the affairs of magicians ? I did n't want to get involved . Instead , I just nodded , “

20827	20831	20788	20790	THE FLYING SORCERERS	70	” Purple nodded , “

20863	20906	20788	20790	THE FLYING SORCERERS	70	" I stopped in mid - sentence . Dark and blue they were , each with a bloody edge - constant reminder that the time of terror was upon us . Was the man fearless - or foolish ? I shut up . “

I had been puzzling about it since I had first seen him do the trick . There was a pattern of bumps in the surface of the nestwall . He tapped at these in a quick precise pattern . I presumed that the pattern must have been the spell to open the door , but it was too quick for me to memorize . He stepped inside ; the door slid shut and he was gone . Dejectedly , I trudged back to the encampment - or what was left of the encampment . Already the villagers were fleeing from their makeshift homes . Men were hastily packing travel kits , women were calling for spratlings . Children and dogs ran excitedly through the crowd , kicking up dust , chickens and scavengers , Panic - stricken families were already moving across the steppes , upslope , downslope , sideways , anywhere , just as long as it was away from Purple ; the magician who brought disaster with him . My own wives were standing about nervously , waiting for me . Numbers one and two were trying to comfort number three , who was most upset . “

21282	21325	21276	21276	You	582	” My words had an immediate calming effect on the distraught woman , more so than all the stroking and soothing of the other two wives , once more proving that only a man can know how to handle the unusual situation . “

21415	22131	22134	22135	the others	562	" They did as I bade them — but with no small amount of grumbling . Even though I thought to remove their hobbles so as to speed the journey , they grumbled — and for once they had cause . For a day and a half we had fled the site of the coming duel . Purple had easily , thoughtlessly nullified that effort with only a few moments of flight . Within an hour the encampment was deserted . As we moved down the hill , I thought I saw Purple moving like a lost soul through the empty lean - to shelters . We were the only family to return to the village . Where the others had fled I did not know . Probably south , away from the whole region . They had likely lost all interest in watching the duel , even from a distance . Now they wanted only to save their skins . In the fading daylight , we approached the village warily . The blue sun winked out behind the edge of the world , leaving only the semicircular bulge of the red . The mists rising off the distant swamps took fire from the glow . It was as if the whole western edge of the world were aflame . I could almost smell the burning of it , a smell of disaster on the evening wind . 46 THE FLYING SORCERERS I left my wives at the nest , the nest to which I had thought we would never return , and headed toward Shoogar 's . I carried a pack with me - a meal for him - perhaps his last . As I made my way through the village I could see the many effects of his spellcasting . Here and there , some of our proudest housetrees lay on their sides , as if they had been blasted out of the ground with great force . Others seemed to have withered and died where they stood . Here and there a nest lay on the ground , shattered walls laying it open to the elements . Everywhere were great patches of dying vegetation . The scavenger animals were gone . There were no sounds of nightbirds . Except for my wives , myself , and of course , Shoogar , the village was empty . And dead . Even if Shoogar won the duel , none would ever be able to return to this village . Nor would they want to . Its stability had been permanently destroyed . All was silent and brooding . The dead grass crunched under my feet as I approached · Shoogar 's nest . I knocked cautiously on the wall . When he appeared I gasped in horror . Shoogar had gone gray and haggard ; new circles had appeared under his eyes and his skin was discolored in angry red patches as if he had been caught too close to one of his own spells . But what had startled me most was that Shoogar had shaved off all of his fur ! He was totally naked and hairlessa frightening caricature of the mad magician ! He greeted me with a wan smile , grateful for my company . I began to lay out the ritual supper for him . It is traditional that on the night before a duel the men of the village serve a meal of faith to their patron warlock . But the others had fled , so that duty had fallen on me alone . I stood silently by and waited , serving him at each gesture or grunt . It was not much of a meal , but it was the best I could prepare under such circumstances . Shoogar seemed not to mind . He ate slowly , savoring every bite . He looked tired and his hands trembled as he moved . But he ate heartily . By the time he laid aside his bone food - stabber , the red sun had long disappeared from the west . The moons had not yet appeared . He moved slowly , but whether from satiation or exhaustion , it was impossible to tell . THE FLYING SORCERERS 47 “

34772	34842	34723	34723	He	869	“ Nonsense , Lant . I won the duel . Only the loser gets killed . I saw the black nest return . It attacked the village instead of coming up into the mountains after me . If it was going to destroy the village anyway , there was no longer any reason for me to stay up in the hills . So I dug out the other bicycle . ”

35586	35660	35698	35698	they	903	” I said . I spat out a bitter shred at Pilg 's feet . He eyed it uncertainly , but pride won out over hunger . He would not eat it unless it was offered to him . I would not do so . I had fed him three times in the past three hands of days and I had no intention of taking Pilg any closer into my family than that . “
35677	35681	35698	35698	they	903	" Pilg exulted . "
35706	35707	35803	35803	they	903	" “
35815	35853	35936	35936	you	913	" My mention of food had caused Pilg to salivate ; the spittle ran down his chin — but social protocol held him back . He glanced again at the discarded bit of root near his foot . “
35897	35898	35936	35936	you	913	" “

35948	36016	36021	36021	Lant	71	" Pilg looked hurt . Immediately I felt sorry , it had been a cruel and unkind thing to say . Pilg had indeed suffered more than I , and it was unfair for me to add my mockery to his as fast as me for any vind stored up They will b have us 78 THE FLYING SORCERERS skills for ing was land already heavy burden . “
36023	36027	36035	36035	I	0	” he said , "
36038	36039	36035	36035	I	0	" "
36042	36059	37254	37254	I	0	" I said , and immediately wondered why , for I did want him to go . “
36073	37253	37265	37266	my Advisors	916	" Curse it ! He 'd done it to me again ! I had sworn I was not going to invite him to partake — but he had annoyed me until I had insulted him , and then to assuage the insult , I had to prove to him that he had not annoyed me . I wondered if I was going to have to start eating my meals in secret just to avoid Pilg . But he was right about that one point . Perhaps we would be able to trade some of our skills for some of their food . Probably my own trade of bonemongering was not as skillfully practiced this far south as it was in the land we had journeyed from . But so much of it depended upon the magician of this village . Would Shoogar be willing to swear an oath of truce for the duration of the wading season ? Would the new magician even want Shoogar around , considering the strength of his reputation ? Would you feel safe if a magician of such power wanted to move into your neighborhood ? If this new magician could not match Shoogar 's knowledge and skills , would Shoogar deign to treat him as an equal ? Was there a magician anywhere who could match the powers Shoogar had already so dramatically demonstrated ? Shoogar might , just might , consider dueling this village 's magician for the right to rule the magic of this area . If he lost ( an unlikely chance ) , we would have to keep movingonly this time without our magician . More likely , if he won , we would incur much ill will in this area , for is it not said that a new magician must take nine generations to be accepted by a tribe ? I feared for the inevitable meeting with these villagers and their Guild of Advisors . Hopefully , we would have time to rest before that meeting , but probably not . As soon as they became aware of our presence here on the slopes of their mountain , they would send an emissary . There was n't much left of our Guild - We would be a sorry group of representatives : myself , of course ; Hinc the Weaver , Pilg the Crier , Damd the Tree Binder , and one or two THE FLYING SORCERERS 79 others . Ran'll the Quaff - Maker had drowned in one of his vats , Tavit the Shepherd had been lost with much of his flock , and none of the remaining shepherds was yet old enough to replace him in the Guild . Some of the others had not survived our long trek south . But the two Guilds would meet and hopefully we would work out some kind of agreement whereby we could camp on this land until the waters should withdraw . Then we would either seek a new area to plant our village , or petition for the right to remain . But again , so much depended on the magicians . Later , as red sunset / blue dawn approached , our tired group of Advisors trudged across the slope to the lower village and the obligatory meeting with them . We had spent most of the red day bathing in the cold stream that ran through the pasture , and allowing the women to massage us and rub precious oils and fats into our skins . The oils and fats had been saved specifically for such an occasion as this . Had we not had this eventual confrontation continually in mind , we would have eaten them long ago . We had exchanged our traveling skins for other garments . We would not be presenting ourselves as poorly as we really were , for we had stripped nearly every member of the tribe naked in order to assemble enough fine clothing for our Advisors to wear to this all - important council . Shoogar stayed behind , to meditate ; the time was not yet right for the other village to cast its eyes on his magnificence . As we walked , Damd the Tree Binder remarked on the fine quality of woods in this area . There were thin strong shoots of bambooze , the fibrous tubular plant that could be used for building , or that could be eaten as food or fermented for Quaff . There were tall slender birts , stippled in gray and brown ; there were sparkling aspen , white spirit pine and sturdy red vampire oaks . There was rich , dark 80 THE FLYING SORCERERS 1e village they mightrade our this landit a hill , than our Of shrubbery , and wild houseplants , stunted and twisted for lack of a magician 's blessing and a proper Binding . There were streams aplenty , and as we walked we trudged through a thick carpet of crackling discarded leaves . Yes , this was a rich wood . One which had been finely cared for , but had not yet realized its full potential . Before we were halfway through this thick arm of forest , it was obvious that this was as fine an area in which to live as any . one could hope for . Froo , the eldest shepherd , exclaimed over the grazing grounds ; Jark , - who had some moderate skill at quaffmaking , expressed delight over the quality of the bambooze . Hinc the Weaver munched thoughtfully on a fiber plant as he walked . If they allowed us to stay , we would be lucky indeed . I speculated that there must be more work here than any one village could hope to do . If they had had a good harvest this year , they might be in an expansive mood . It was our hope that we could trade our labors for some of their food , or for the right to use some of this land . Their village was on the crest of a hill , lowest of the range below the wooded slopes . It was larger than our own had been , but not impressively so . Most important , many of their housetrees appeared unused , and those that were had considerable distance between them . Where our village had had a solid - packed floor of dirt from the extensive comings and goings of commerce , this village had a gentle carpet of blackgrass , cut through only here and there by dirt paths . Clearly they did not trade on the scale we were used to . As we approached , we could see their Advisors gathering in a clearing near the edge of the village . We raised our hands and gave them the finger gesture of fertility . They returned it . A tall man covered with sparse curly fur , brownish red , stepped forward . “
37268	37389	37456	37456	You	917	” And he introduced them . There were more than thirty - traders , weavers , fishmongers , Quaffmakers and craftsmen were amply represented . To my ill - concealed delight , they did not introduce a bonemonger . Could it be that this village lacked one of my skill ? If so , I was sure to find much work . Or - a dampening thought - could it be that THE FLYING SORCERERS 81 they did not consider a bonemonger important enough to belong to the Guild of Advisors ? I thrust that thought away . A bonemonger was as good as anybody . Gortik finished pointing out the last of his Advisors , then turned to us . “
37395	37455	37465	37465	You	917	” That was a poser . We had not yet designated any of our number as Speaker . We had buried Thran , our old Speaker , only two hands of days previously . His memory was still too warm for us . There was much shuffling and whispering amongst ourselves . Finally Pilg pushed me forward , saying , “
37475	37476	37477	37477	I	0	" "
37481	37486	37503	37503	We	918	" I whispered back . "

37557	37569	37576	37576	Lant	71	" I hissed . The rest nodded eagerly . Hinc said , “

37598	37612	37619	37619	He	71	" And with that he pushed me out of the huddle and announced , “

37648	37702	37706	37706	you	0	” I quavered . I had the feeling that at any moment , ancient Thran would step forward to question my impudence . Or that somehow Gortik would recognize me as an impostor and fail to grant me the respect due my uneasy office . But he merely nodded his acceptance and said , “

38033	38068	38074	38074	I	0	“ Nobody lives on the Heights . Mostly because nothing grows . We stay there during Wading Season , but only because the ocean covers everything else . Otherwise , it 's free land . ”

39184	39346	39368	39368	they	957	” hus But we aren are so sme time ? Sure enough , a terrible thing happened . Try as we could to hurry , the seas rose up and sealed off the island . It took eleven days . . It would have taken us only a few hours to cross by way of the Neck , an ever - narrowing strip of land , but somehow , we just could n't get the women organized . The confusion in the camp was terrible . It took six days just to get the tents down , and then it was so late we had to put them back up . again so we could get to sleep . After all , the red sun was high in the sky and it was night . Gortik and his advisors came up to see us on the second day . They stood about and fretted , urging us constantly to hurry faster . "
39382	39383	39388	39388	you	956	” "
39394	39398	39503	39503	Lant	71	" murmured Gortik . “
39405	39502	39512	39512	I	0	” I chimed brightly , and scurried off .. Thereafter , Gortik came up every day to fret and moan and worry over the delay of our departure . Finally , though , we were on our way . Gortik and his advisors were only too happy to act as our guides . It took us five days to cross the island . We arrived at the Neck just in time to see the seas crash over its peak . Gortik sighed , a sound of despair . I sighed too . He looked at me , “
39522	39528	39512	39512	I	0	” He shook his head . “
39545	39557	39512	39512	I	0	" I had to agree with him . . He said , “
39578	39589	40127	40127	Your	963	" I nodded . Reluctantly , I gave the order . "
39619	40126	40160	40160	themselves	3132	” We were settled in again on the Heights of Idiocy well before nightfall . It was time to introduce our magicians . I was extraordinarily pleased with myself . Lant the Speaker ! Speaker of one of the finest villages in the world ! Speaker for Shoogar the magnificent ! I beamed proudly . Shoogar was an impressive figure in a purple and red robe , one that changed colors as the suns changed their positions in the sky . On a string around his neck he wore the quartz lenses of the mad magician , a trophy of the kill and a token of proof that he was who he claimed to be . In a high singsong chant he told them of his skill , how he had defeated his most dangerous enemy , Purple , the mad magician who had claimed to come from the other side of the sky . There was a stir among the listeners at that . Evidently , Shoogar 's fame had preceded us . He told of how he had flattened the mountain , Critic 's Tooth , how he had called down the thunder and laid waste to the land for miles around . As proof , he held high Purple 's quartz lenses . He embroidered the story hardly at all — the truth was impressive enough . When he finished , I detailed how we had had to flee our former village because of the side effects of Shoogar 's spell ; how we had been travelling south for nearly a quarter of a cycle . Our journey had begun at the blue conjunction , and stretched across hundreds of miles and the floor of the empty ocean . The suns had moved farther and farther apart in the sky as we traveled , Red Virn and Blue Ouells stretching the days longer and longer between them until the darks shrank away to nothing . I told how , at great danger and loss of life , we had crossed the great desert mudflats . As the darkless time approached down the the mounta preceded listeners at other THE FLYING SORCERERS 87 the seas had returned to this land , and the latter part of our journey had been a pell - mell flight from the ever - encroaching waters . Many were the times we awakened to find the ocean lapping at our tents . I did not mention that that was how we had lost Thran , drowned in his tent one night . It would not do for them to know that I was so new to Speaking for my village . Now Virn and Ouells were living at opposite ends of the sky , and the darkless time was upon us . As the oceans crept to their height , I related how we had arrived here at the base , of the southern mountains , seeking refuge and a place to build a new village . Gortik smiled , “
40162	40163	40160	40160	themselves	3132	” “
40170	40175	40160	40160	themselves	3132	” I said calmly . “
40178	40182	40196	40196	Our	968	” said Gortik , “
40194	40195	40196	40196	Our	968	” “
40201	40205	40230	40230	he	964	" I countered , “
40223	40224	40269	40270	Our magician	3679	" “
40236	40268	40283	40283	He	3679	” Gortik 's smile mocked us . It was obvious he did not believe in Shoogar 's power . I hoped it would not be necessary to demonstrate it to him . “
40272	40276	40307	40309	the old magician	974	" Gortik continued , “
40311	40334	40340	40340	Purple	108	” The shrubbery rustled behind Gortik as if someone were hurriedly being moved into place . Gortik stepped aside then , saying , “
40345	40554	40559	40559	you	71	” I thought my heart would stop . Shoogar stood trembling and speechless , unable to move . The man who had stepped forward was indeed Purple , the living breathing man whom Shoogar had killed - had thought he had killed - in fiery combat at the last conjunction . Around Shoogar the others of our village shrank away as if to escape Purple 's inevitable lightning strike . I wanted to shrink within myself . I wanted to run . I wanted 88 THE FLYING SORCERERS to die . Well , at least the latter wish would be granted - and soon . Purple looked us over carefully . He wore his suit of sky blue — all of one piece , it fitted his bulk like a second skin . Several objects hung from the wide belt around his formidable waist . The hood was thrown back . His glance was squinty and unsure ; his eyes were watery and wavered back and forth from one to the other of us . At last his searching gaze came to rest on - oh , Elcin , nok - on me . He strode forward eagerly , grasping my shoulders and peering close into my face , “
40561	40602	40643	40643	Shoogar	70	” His words were oddly pronounced , but they came from his own mouth , With his speakerspell destroyed he had had to learn to talk like a man . He released me before I could faint and looked around , “
40610	40642	40643	40643	Shoogar	70	” ! He caught sight of the shorter magician then ; Shoogar was stiff and trembling . This was it - I braced myself . Let it at least be painless . "
40645	40656	40662	40662	I	0	" he said , stepping past me , hands outstretched . “
40670	40839	40894	40894	You	979	" Shoogar uttered a single , inhuman shriek and leapt at his throat . The two of them tumbled to the ground , the big magician and the small . Shoogar was making unholy grunting noises , Purple was choking for air . It took nine of us to pry them apart . The youngest and strongest members of our council bore Shoogar kicking and screaming out of the clearing . His cries carried back to us through the woods until they were cut off by the sound of a splash . The river . In a moment , a chastened , dripping Shoogar returned to us , flanked on one side by Jark the Shepherd and on the other by Wilville , my eldest son . He stood there glowering . Meanwhile , Purple was brushing himself off . He was surrounded by solicitous and concerned advisors . They patted at his bulk like anxious women . Gortik was nonplussed . He looked at me and said , “
40851	40893	40913	40913	God	140	” I looked from him to Purple . My head reeled . I felt I was drowning . My mouth opened and closed like a fish tossed upon the bank to die . How could this disaster have found us out ? “
40898	40905	40913	40913	God	140	" I said to the magician , “
40915	41003	41009	41009	He	980	” but there I got stuck for the question itself was insane . Purple believed in no Gods , he had said so many times . I could not look at him , at his paunchy frame , his alien flesh , his pale hairless skin and his patches of unnaturally straight black fur . He was ugly in my eyes , and menacing to my soul and sanity . Gortik was smiling , pleased at our discomfiture . I gestured at Purple and managed to croak , "
41006	41008	41009	41009	He	980	" . "
41017	41021	41028	41040	a magician who was not as well appreciated as he might have been	983	" Gortik said . “
41042	41047	41069	41069	Dorthi	108	" He frowned darkly . “
41067	41068	41071	41071	We	982	” "
41075	41108	41071	41071	We	982	" Shoogar murmured . I nodded . Gortik 's was a familiar story . Sometimes magicians endure long after their powers and their respect have vanished . Villages suffer because of it . “
41116	41120	41190	41192	A strange magician	989	" Gortik continued . "
41195	41196	41197	41197	He	989	” "
41203	41219	41223	41223	he	989	” Gortik nodded . The other Advisors interrupted each other in their eagerness to explain , “
41226	41227	41229	41229	he	989	” “
41234	41235	41243	41248	None 89 90 THE FLYING SORCERERS	992	” “

41278	41289	41327	41327	We	982	” Gortik roared . There was quiet ; Gortik said , “
41335	41336	41346	41347	Poor Dorthi	142	" “
41341	41345	41346	41347	Poor Dorthi	142	” Shoogar repeated . “

41373	41384	41385	41385	He	108	” Gortik said , as if that were explanation enough . "
41390	41400	41462	41462	My	0	” said Shoogar , and that was explanation enough . “
41407	41461	41462	41462	My	0	" Purple said . He took a step forward and thumped himself hard in the belly with his fist . His belly was big and soft , so the blow should have made him wince . It did not . I thought for a moment that Purple had become as rigid as stone . “
41466	41470	41495	41496	a boy	478	” he repeated . “
41506	41507	41511	41511	You	71	” “
41516	41517	41560	41560	Purple	108	" “
41552	41558	41596	41596	he	108	" I did not realize , "
41562	41595	41596	41596	he	108	" that my flying egg was moving . You had painted thick gray goo over all the knobs and dials , so that I could see none of the settings on my — "
41604	41608	41631	41631	Purple	108	“ — spellmakers . ”
41634	41659	41663	41663	he	108	“ Somehow they had gained entrance to my flying egg — which I have told you about — and done terrible things to it . ”
41666	41682	41707	41707	he	108	“ I was furious , Lant . I would have killed the pack of you . ”
41703	41706	41707	41707	he	108	“ Later , "
41710	41761	41927	41927	Purple	108	“ I realized that you had acted from ignorance . Perhaps you thought that the egg was alive and dangerous . Perhaps that was the reason for Shoogar 's earlier attacks on me . I wanted to know why , why you had dirtied and broken implements in my flying home “
41834	41904	41915	41915	Shoogar	70	“ When I opened the door to go looking for you , the wind of my passage picked me up and sucked me out . When I realized I was falling , I pulled my hood up and curled in a ball . My impact suit saved me by holding my shape - much as water in a vase does not change shape when you set it down hard . "
41905	41913	41915	41915	Shoogar	70	“ I wish the vase had broken , ”
41917	41924	41927	41927	Purple	108	" The fall knocked me out , "
41929	41983	41989	41989	I	0	“ but I broke no bones . But I saw very little of the landscape coming down . I still do n't know just where here is my flying egg does not respond to my signals . It has not answered me for months . I fear it may be beyond my scope . "
41984	41988	41989	41989	I	0	“ True enough , ”
41992	42016	41927	41927	Purple	108	“ Shoogar 's spells entirely destroyed it . It was over the mountain called Critic 's Tooth when Elcin 's hammer struck it . ”
42017	42020	41927	41927	Purple	108	“ Elcin ? "
42021	42032	41989	41989	I	0	“ The small , but mighty , god of thunder . "
42033	42049	42085	42085	Purple	108	“ Ah , yes . I know him . You say he struck my egg ? "
42050	42084	42085	42085	Purple	108	“ He struck it with a great flash , and a sound loud enough to shake the world and shatter the sky . I could neither hear nor see for many moments afterward . "
42092	42107	42149	42149	Purple	108	“ Tell me , Lant , does the ground glow blue at night now ? "
42108	42148	42189	42189	Purple	108	“ In the old village , yes . And all the trees and grass have died . Villagers and animals as well . Look , Pilg and Ang have lost their fur , and Pilg is covered with sores . "
42183	42188	42198	42198	He	108	“ It 's true , ”
42192	42197	42198	42198	He	108	“ I am marooned . ”
42209	42215	42198	42198	He	108	“ Those are radiation sores . “
42219	42223	42224	42224	You	1004	" he repeated . “
42230	42246	42269	42269	you	1004	" He was trailing off into gibberish in his excitement . He looked blindly around . “
42271	42305	42269	42269	you	1004	" We all shrank back , even Purple 's own villagers . He was being too free with his curses . But Gortik and several of his Advisors stepped forward to comfort Purple . “
42310	42321	42269	42269	you	1004	" they murmured , patting his shoulders with visible reluctance . “

42559	42657	42555	42555	you	0	" Purple echoed , in such a way that two Advisors stepped up to take his arms . Gortik glanced at me , at Purple , at Shoogar . He must have been thinking furiously . He had thought his magician better than ours ; but now Purple had admitted to being hurt , and hurt badly , by Shoogar 's dueling spells . Obviously both magicians were powers to be reckoned with . How they must hate each other . It boded not well for either village . Gortik , the Speaker , drew me aside . “

42752	42791	42702	42702	You	1013	" I nodded immediately . How much longer would Shoogar restrain himself ? We had to get away from Purple 's own dueling ground as fast as we could . I waved my hands frantically at my Advisors . “
42800	43230	43309	43309	Lant	71	" All I wanted was to put as much distance between Shoogar and Purple as possible . We hurried back up the slope . One thought was uppermost : we were trapped on an island with two mad magiciansElcin 's Wrath — what had we done to deserve such a fate ? Could we have possibly angered the Gods that much ? It did not take long for the word to spread . The wave of dismay was a visible thing as it washed across the encampment . Women began wailing , strong men trembled , children bawled in confusion . Dogs barked . Many began tugging at their tent ropes , pulling them down . Exhausted as they were , they were ready to move on , so great was their fear of Purple . Incrediblel — that these few pitiful families had once been a strong and fruitful village . Yet so we had been before the coming of Purple . We had seen that village reduced to rubble , seen our friends and neighbors dead , and our property obliterated because of the feud between Shoogar and the mad magician . And the duel was not yet over . Purple still lived . He had followed us , and he would destroy us . No . He had flown here in a single night . For a quarter of a cycle , he had been waiting for our arrival ! Shoogar was unapproachable . That Purple still lived , was indication of his failure . He had cast his finest spell , and the 94 THE FLYING SORCERERS other held not even a grudge . Angrily , Shoogar shook off his two escorts and stamped off across the already sea - dampened field . The crowd parted before him like goats from a pool of defiled water . Anxious mothers herded their children safely out of sight . All over the camp tents were falling now as the word spread . The people were ready to flee ; they did not know where they would go , but they were willing to die trying , so great was their fear of Purple . Here and there , sobbing women were loading their packs . Children tugged at their skirts . Many of the men I passed were putting extra sets of hobbles on their wives — there is no telling what a hysterical woman will do . Several members of the Guild of Advisors were standing and arguing . They broke apart when they saw me . "

Shoogar would not move without consulting me first . I told them we would stay here . There was again some grumbling , but we were committed to this course of action — if not by my authority as Speaker , then certainly by the authority of the all - encompassing sea . Clearly , they had not expected me to fare so well with Shoogar , but since I had , they were left with no choice but to honor my claim to the office . It was as if the Gods themselves were backing me up .. As they wandered back to their tents I called my two sons , Wilville and Orbur , to me . Wilville , noticing my smile , asked , “

This time it would be just the two of us , without our squabbling councils to hinder us . We had finished with the formalities of the greetings , and now we could get down to the real business of negotiating . Of course , we had no choice in the matter . I and my fellow villagers were here for the duration of the wading season . Gortik and I had to come to some sort of agreement on how our two villages could survive till the onset of the next conjunction . To tell the truth , I was uneasy . This would be the first time I would have to Speak for my whole village and make decisions for them . It was one thing to browbeat one 's own people for their own good - quite another to attempt it with a perfect stranger . I carried with me a token of luck in lieu of the new Speaking Token which Shoogar had not yet begun to build . ( One of the most important ingredients he still had not locateda stone the weight of a small child . Indeed , we had not even selected the small child yet , whose weight was to be the - standard of the token . ) I felt únsure of myself without a proper Speaking Token - and worried that I might not do a proper job . “

'' The wide river swept through it on its surging course to the sea . Great black housetrees lined both sides of its banks . There were many frog - tending ponds and dams , and there were terraced riceblossom pools along the river banks . Off to one side , well away from the village proper was a tree so misshapen that had it been human , it surely would have been stillborn . Clearly , that was the nest of Purple the Magician . But that was not my destination . Not yet . First I would speak to Gortik . As I entered the village proper , a curious ragtag of villagers and children began to follow me .

52951	52985	53023	53023	He	108	“ But we will do anything to help you , Purple , anything ! We only wish the same as you — that you can return to your home as soon as possible . ”
52989	53022	53023	53023	He	108	“ That is very generous of you , but I am afraid there is no way . My flying egg is destroyed . I have no way to lift into the sky . "

53078	53109	53116	53116	Purple	108	" The egg that Shoogar - sank , that was only a small vehicle for exploring the contours of a world . I left the larger vehicle in the sky . ”
53119	53163	53173	53173	Gortik	134	“ No , you need not fear , Lant . It will not fall — not unless I call it down . But I am too far south to do that . If there were some way I could return to the north — "
53164	53172	53177	53177	Purple	108	" You mean you would leave us ? ”
53181	53229	53238	53238	Purple	108	“ Oh , my friend Gortik , I know 116 THE FLYING SORCERERS how it must hurt you , but please try to realize - I yearn to return to my home in the sky , to converse , confer and otherwise hobnob with my brother wizards . "
53241	53308	53315	53315	I	0	“ But , alas , there is no way . I can not travel north overland because the sea already covers everything . And I dare not attempt it by boat . I am told that it will be all whirlpools and dangerous uncharted reefs . There is no path by land , and there is no path by sea . I am marooned , marooned . ”
53320	53342	53363	53363	I	0	“ If only there were a path through the air — but nothing goes through the air but birds and eggs . "

53367	53378	53384	53384	he	108	“ perhaps today you might not be in this predicament . ”

53809	53824	53884	53884	Shoogar	70	“ I do n't like it , Lant . I do n't like it . "
53825	53883	53884	53884	Shoogar	70	“ But Shoogar , do n't you see what it means ? You win after all -- you fought him because he would n't show you how to fly — you did n't kill him , but you put him into a position where he has to show you how , or he ca n't go home . ”
53888	53926	53928	53928	he	1261	“ So what ? Why should I help him build a flying machine ? He will leave in it and I will still have no fly in lying to unexcites or he put him or you ho after “

54425	54440	54444	54444	him	1261	" I asked . He fingered the lenses on the string around his neck . "

55031	55038	55040	55040	he	108	” Shoogar said . I relaxed . “

55054	55369	55378	55378	Him	1289	” The blue sun was at one side of the sky ; the red sun was at the other . The world was bathed in red and blue light ; 120 THE FLYING SORCERERS tereo of them caught big shortnes stumping in shadows stretched in two directions . We waited in the meadow below the heights . All was still . This would be the first meeting of the two magicians would they be able to live up to their truce ? Purple , fat and paunchy , was already waddling up the slope , escorted by Gortik and his advisors . He was a bright figure in his suit of strange cloth . He paused and squinted up the hill . I looked too . Shoogar was stumping imperiously toward us , magnificent in his shortness . Shoogar caught sight of Purple then , and stopped . The two of them surveyed each other , one up the hill , one down . For a moment , all was still and silent . I held my breath and prayed . And then Shoogar took a step forward , another . Purple did likewise . I exhaled loudly in relief ; the two magicians carefully closed the remaining distance . They ended up facing each other , one standing to either side of me ; Gortik was standing opposite my position , also between the two magicians . As Speakers for our villages , we had thought it best to place ourselves so . If the magicians should attack each other , we would be there to stop them ( I hoped ) . If we could n't stop them . ... Well , I would be in no position to worry about it . Shoogar and Purple eyed each other warily , Shoogar looking Purple up and down , Purple only looking down . “
55373	55377	55378	55378	Him	1289	” I prompted . "
55381	55390	55378	55378	Him	1289	” they both said , pointing in unison . “
55393	55542	55599	55599	me	0	" Gortik and I cried . Reluctantly , Shoogar and Purple reached out and took · each other 's right hand ; then they joined left hands too . Now neither could reach his spellcasting equipment without first letting go , which would allow the other to reach for his . They glared at each other across their linked arms . I looked at Gortik and nodded . He nodded back . Simultaneously , we each turned to our respective wizard and snipped off a lock of his hair , two fingernail clippings , and took a droplet of blood and a nasal dropping . While the two magicians watched , we mixed these ingredients together in a bowl between them , then separated THE FLYING SORCERERS 121 the result into two equal portions which we put into spell bags , one for Shoogar , one for Purple . “
55590	55596	55599	55599	me	0	" They continued to scowl . “
55601	55605	55619	55619	I	0	" I said , “

55697	55710	55712	55712	you	1297	" His eyes were fierce . After a moment , I repeated , “
55725	55730	55739	55739	I	0	” He muttered something . “
55733	55738	55739	55739	I	0	" I kicked him . “
55742	55774	55794	55794	I	0	” he snapped . Gortik leaned forward then and slid a leather - and - hair ring around the third finger of Shoogar 's left hand . I turned to Purple . “

55914	55972	55890	55890	Gortik	134	" Simultaneously , they let go of each others ' hands and leapt apart , glaring angrily . I closed my eyes and waited . There were no explosions , no hissing fireballs . I opened my eyes . They were still standing there , looking at each other . prosimultaneous abgrilyo Pissing as 122 THE FLYING SORCERERS "
55977	55981	55982	55982	They	1304	” murmured Gortik . “

55995	56012	56068	56068	Lant	71	” I said . Purple drew himself up and took a step forward , hand outstretched . “
56017	56067	56101	56101	Shoogar	70	” he asked . Shoogar slowly lifted them from around his neck . Reluctantly , he handed them over . Purple took them reverently , carefully . Hands trembling , he wiped them with a soft cloth and placed them across his face . He squinted around at us , “
56088	56100	56101	56101	Shoogar	70	" He stepped impulsively forward and clasped Shoogar 's right hand . "
56118	56137	56101	56101	Shoogar	70	" He was smiling - He actually meant it ! Shoogar was caught by surprise . He muttered , “
56142	56149	56101	56101	Shoogar	70	” without even realizing he had . “
56158	56159	56101	56101	Shoogar	70	" "
56162	56166	56216	56217	A man	3146	" laughed Purple , "
56175	56215	56225	56225	he	3146	” Gortik and I looked at each other . It was a start . If only they did n't kill each other trying . I was beginning to understand what old Thran had meant when he used to say , "
56239	56685	56690	56690	Ouells	107	" In fact , I was beginning to suspect that the goatherding task might be easier . For instance , it appeared that I had to organize the flying machine construction . I appointed Wilville and Orbur as officials aides and instructed them never to leave Purple and Shoogar alone together - not for any reason whatever . The boys nodded soberly . They understood all too well , but they were willing to accept the task — they were as eager to build the flying machine as Purple and Shoogar were . THE FLYING SORCERERS 123 Now if only the other men of the village would be as willing to accept my leadership . I smiled bitterly at the thought . If only the seas were Quaff , we could all get drunk - I might as well wish for a moon to fall out of the sky and carry away all my problems . The way things were going , if the seas were to turn to Quaff , I would find only a bladder with a hole in it . Hinc and the others had wanted to stay , then they wanted to migrate , then they wanted to stay — then they found out that staying meant they would have to clear the upper slopes , bind new housetrees , build extra nests and make the area livable — and they wanted to move on again . They wanted to do everything but work . To tell the truth though , the woods here were wild — they were a savage tangle of red crabvines and scraggly blackbushes . Broken branches hung everywhere , and stingbee nests were a common sight . Graygauzes hung from almost every branch , and once we found a hollow of nesting vampire kites . Everywhere else the woods seemed delightfully tame and well cared for — but here , where we were supposed to settle , here it was as if all the wildness had been stored for the rest of the forest . Or perhaps we had not noticed these things until we began to work . We all nursed stings and bites . The women were never less than exhausted . , We men ate badly - sometimes worse than on the trailand lived in chaos . That the work was tiring was no secret . For once even the women were allowed to grumble . The children helped or hindered as suited their whims , and in general had a fine time . Shoogar appeared each morning at the rising of the blue sun and blessed the day with a hasty chant : "
56710	57078	56690	56690	Ouells	107	" Then he disappeared back into his nest to sleep until noon . Meanwhile the shepherds had located several excellent pastures on which to graze the sheep . And they were delighted -at first - with the workforce sent up from the lower village . One of the lads was identical twins — so that though he was counted only as one , he did the work of two . In effect we svouelised out west to shepher 124 THE FLYING SORCERERS had four novice shepherds to pick the burrs out of the wool and comb the sheep . That , of course , freed several of the more experienced novices to work alongside the rest of us in the sloping wood . They appreciated that not at all . Life in the sloping wood gradually became more pleasant than wandering across the deserts — that is , once we had housetrees and nests enough for our own needs . Hinc began to talk of weaving again , and began testing various fiberplants and trees . Jark was daily to be seen testing some new and exotic kind of root or herb as a flavoring for Quaff . Ang , faced by an absence of frogs , changed his vocation and set up fishing rods along the stream . And I Now that I had settled the affairs of two villages and their magicians , I was ready to return to bonemongering . Trone the Coppersmith was a dealer in metals and a member of the Guild of Advisors of the Lower Village . He was a broad scowling man who spoke in monosyllables . The hair of his head and torso was brown and coarse . He seemed to regard my wares with disfavor . I was at a loss to understand his hostility . At the beginning of our trek I had taken only the most valuable pieces of petrified bone from the ruins of the village . Later , on the trek , I had increased my store from a desert trove , an ancient runforit skeleton , dry and hard as stone . Trone should have been impressed , but he was n't . “
57084	57089	57091	57091	you	1315	” I asked him . “
57096	57097	57091	57091	you	1315	" "
57100	57104	56690	56690	Ouells	107	" he snapped . "
57130	57131	57139	57139	I	0	" “
57149	57150	57139	57139	I	0	" “
57153	57158	57177	57177	he	156	" the coppersmith admitted , “
57186	57342	57177	57177	he	156	” - Bellis the Potter . What was a potter ? I learned that by watching him at work . He took clay from the bottom of the river and worked it into the shapes of bowls . When it dried , it was as hard as any bone though far more brittle . Bellis had worked this into a high art , baking the clay ornaments in the hot sunlight until they would not go soft in the water , and could be used to carry water , soup , stews . He had even learned ways to paint and decorate the bowls and harden them by fire . It was possible to make other things as well out of clay . Bellis was considered one of the best workers of his craft in the region . Indeed , he could do things with his clay that I could not do with my bone . “
57345	57349	57409	57409	My	0	” I suggested , “
57385	57408	57465	57465	them	1324	” Bellis was a squat man , short and bent , almost deformed . He looked up at me through wizened eyes . "
57469	57496	57465	57465	them	1324	” Which might account for his twisted shape , I thought . But since I had no wish to quarrel with him , I said only , “
57503	57504	57563	57563	Your	1326	” “
57534	57562	57568	57570	Lant the Speaker	71	” Like a bonemonger in my own region , Bellis the Potter understood some rudimentary magic , at least enough to discuss his needs with a magician . “
57585	57586	57589	57589	I	0	" “
57596	57600	57613	57613	he	70	” I said . “
57623	57624	57613	57613	he	70	" “
57627	57631	58089	58089	You	1327	" said Bellis . “
57697	58088	58089	58089	You	1327	” I felt betrayed . Bellis was right , of course . To a magician at least , the advantages of clay over bone were enormous . And to the average person as well — one need not say a prayer of sorrow if one broke a clay bowl , one need only throw away the pieces — and that was that . I knew it instinctively — there was no market for bone here . Probably there never would be , for the best bone is petrified bone and bone would not , could not , petrify here — the climate was too wet . I should have realized it earlier . I could understand now why Hinc and the others had wanted to move on . Hinc was a weaver — but there were better weavers here . Jark was a Quaff - maker - but there was such an abundance of fermentable plants here , everybody made their own Quaff or chewed raba - root . And I was a bonemonger — but nobody used bone at all . ' Even though we wanted to move on , we could not do so until the seas receded — and that time was a long way off . And I doubted that anyone would want to migrate then - already many had announced themselves satisfied with their new homes . During the dry seasons , Gortik had told me , when the seas were down , this island was actually a peninsula off the main southern continent . We could see the larger mass of it across the swollen channel , some twenty - odd miles away . But for all the good it could do us , it might have been beyond the world 's edge . There was just our double village and four others on the island . All were near the shoreline . Every second hand of days , a trading caravan came round bringing the news and goods of the other towns and taking away the news and goods of ours . I soon found out that they had no use for a bonemonger either . No wonder I had seen no bonemonger here — they had all starved to death . When the local villagers wanted to indicate futility , they said , “
58097	58441	58444	58444	lizardhead	1328	” It was a fine time to find that out , I thought bitterly . Well , so I had no trade I must concentrate instead on Speaking for my village . I wondered if I dared tithe my people to pay me for the labor of Speaking for them . I had heard of THE FLYING SORCERERS 127 villages where the Speaker collected a toll from each fully grown man . But I sensed that my tribe would object strongly . My control was still too weak for me to risk such a test of power . Then Wilville and Orbur would have to support me , that was all there was to it . But no , Wilville and Orbur were working for Shoogar and Purple in the lower village . Shoogar and Purple were accepting responsibility for the two of them . Hm . If they were taking care of my sons , they could easily accept the care of the rest of my family , including me . After all , it was the two villages that supported the magicians . If they were to support me too , they would in effect be paying my tithe without ever knowing it . Yes , it would work . I could tell Gortik that I had decided not to ply my trade until after the affair with Purple and Shoogar was settled . My skill as a diplomat would be required to help them work together in order to speed Purple 's ultimate departure . Yes , Gortik would accept that . I went to tell them what I had decided . I found Purple and Shoogar wrangling over a writingskin with complicated markings all over it . Wilville was sitting on a stone crying in frustration . Orbur was patting him on the back . The source of the trouble was a perplexing one . Purple was trying to convince Shoogar that the lines on the skin were a flying machine . Shoogar did n't understand and neither did I. “
58446	58451	58458	58458	They	1329	" he was saying , "

58729	58772	58781	58781	you	70	” As one , they both rolled up their sleeves , preparatory to hurling curses . Without thinking , I stepped between them . Had I thought about it , I 'm sure I would have been moving in the opposite direction . “

58852	58868	58889	58889	I	0	” They hesitated . Before they could work up their fury again , I added , “
58901	58913	58889	58889	I	0	" Both spoke at once - like children , they were : “

58977	58998	59058	59058	Purple	108	" Both magicians turned on him , spells at the ready , but Orbur did n't blanch . He said , “

59071	59075	59076	59076	You	108	” insisted Purple . “

59144	59175	59176	59176	I	0	” I looked at the animal skin . The lines were black on a brown background . Even with his seeing pieces , Purple 's eyesight was none too good . “

59222	59230	59235	59235	you	108	” I asked . Shoogar looked up . “

59565	59614	59554	59554	Shoogar	70	” Shoogar did n't look any too pleased with his duties , neither did Purple . They both started to object , but I would n't hear any of it . I insisted that Wilville and Orbur get to work assembling their tools up on Idiot 's Crag . “
59618	59624	59554	59554	Shoogar	70	" I said to Purple , “
59650	59654	59677	59677	We	1353	" Purple said , “

59801	59808	59846	59846	Shoogar	70	" Shoogar looked up at this . “
59831	59845	59846	59846	Shoogar	70	" You have tried to use swamp gas to make a flying machine ? ”
59850	59901	59907	59907	Shoogar	70	“ That 's more intelligent than anything I would have expected of you , Shoogar . You are more advanced than I thought — that is just what we are going to do . In principle , that is — we will not be getting our gas from a swamp . "
59902	59905	59907	59907	Shoogar	70	“ Gas ? "
59909	59915	59923	59923	Purple	108	“ You use a word — ”
59916	59921	59960	59960	Purple	108	“ Yes , gas , ”
59930	59959	59960	59960	Purple	108	“ Air is many gases mixed together . The gas we will use will come THE FLYING SORCERERS 131 from water . Now , do you see this ? ”
59970	59980	59990	59990	Shoogar	70	“ This is a big bag . We will fill "
59981	59989	59990	59990	Shoogar	70	" That is not a big bag ! ”
59994	60002	60109	60109	He	108	“ That is a blue - drawing ! ”
60055	60108	60109	60109	He	108	“ Uh , forget the blue - drawings , Shoogar . You are right , this is not a big bag , this is a blue - drawing . But we will use big bags to lift the boat . We will fill them with my lighter - than - air gas . "
60114	60215	60223	60223	I	0	“ We will need several things . We will need a boat shell . These people here do not know how to build boats as big as you did up north , and Wilville and Orbur know much about working with wood . They can teach the local boatsmith a thing or two . We will also need cloth , fine cloth , out of which we will tailor the bags . Fortunately , the weaving here is among the finest in the region . Thirdly , we will need gas to fill the bags . I can supply that . ”
60216	60222	60223	60223	I	0	" Then all is settled , ”
60226	60235	60241	60241	Purple	108	“ We can easily build the flying machine . ”
60236	60239	60241	60241	Purple	108	“ Wrong , ”
60243	60264	60223	60223	I	0	“ unfortunately , Wilville and Orbur have so far been unable to find the proper materials for a boat frame . ”
60265	60274	60291	60291	Purple	108	“ Huh ? I thought you just said — ”
60276	60289	60291	60291	Purple	108	“ They know only how to build boats out of heavy wood , "
60293	60351	60361	60361	Shoogar	70	" and this boat must be light as well as strong . It must be made out of the lightest wood possible . Secondly , the quality of the cloth here is still unusable for the gasbags . It is too coarse . We are going to have to teach these people how to weave finer material . ”
60352	60359	60361	60361	Shoogar	70	“ And what about the gas ? "
60363	60376	60379	60379	his	108	“ Is there some reason why we ca n't get that either ? ”
60382	60414	60361	60361	Shoogar	70	“ No , it should be an easy matter to separate the water . I can use my battery , or Trone the Coppersmith can build me a spark - wheel . ”
60415	60426	60445	60445	Shoogar	70	“ Separate the water ? Battery ? Spark - wheel ? ”
60427	60444	60595	60595	Purple	108	“ Water is two gases . We will separate them and use one in the gasbags . ”
60588	60593	60595	60595	Purple	108	“ No , no ! "
60603	60619	60629	60629	I	0	" It should be narrower , and it should have a keel , like so ! ”
60620	60628	60629	60629	I	0	“ Put away the blue - drawings , "
60632	60639	60682	60682	they	1367	“ We do n't need them . ”
60673	60681	60694	60694	Purple	108	“ What will keep it from capsizing ? "
60685	60693	60694	60694	Purple	108	" Outriggers , we will have outriggers , "
60712	60728	60694	60694	Purple	108	“ Then what will keep the thing level when it is suspended in the air ? "
60729	60747	60766	60766	He	108	" A keel , of course a heavier beam of wood at the bottom of the hull . ”
60748	60765	60766	60766	He	108	“ But if it is heavier , wo n't it weigh down the boat too much ? ”
60770	60788	60999	60999	Orbur	78	“ You may be right . If it does , we may have to add another gasbag . "
60981	60998	61055	61055	Purple	108	" Why not sew up just one very big bag as large as all the others ? "
61041	61053	61092	61092	Orbur	78	“ If all I have is one bag and this happens , "
61057	61091	61092	61092	Orbur	78	“ then I am marooned at sea , or even high in the air ! But if I have many bags and this happens , I can only lose one at a time . ”
61096	61107	61162	61162	he	70	“ Yes , yes , I see . I see . "
61151	61161	61162	61162	he	70	“ I have visited every weaver on the island , "
61165	61180	61284	61284	he	70	“ All are eager to supply our needs . This is their finest cloth . "
61289	61309	61284	61284	he	70	“ And why are they here ? I thought this was to be a council of weavers and magicians . ”
61310	61340	61490	61490	he	108	" It is — but they are helping to build the flying machine . They have as much right to participate in these discussions as you . Perhaps more . ”
61481	61489	61490	61490	he	108	“ If the cloth will hold water , ”
61493	61527	61618	61618	Lesta	160	" it can be made to hold air . But if none of these cloths work , we will have to find one that will . Even if we must weave it ourselves . ”
61609	61612	61618	61618	Lesta	160	" Humph , ”
61620	61645	61661	61661	Shoogar	70	" why do you want to carry water in a clothbag anyway ? Why do n't you use a pot like a normal person ? ”
61646	61659	61677	61677	He	108	“ The spell calls for a bag , you butter - wart ! ”
61693	61715	61750	61750	Purple	108	" It is as I feared — these are all too coarse for our purposes . Ca n't you do better ? ”
61716	61749	61753	61753	he	108	“ Those are our best — and if they are the best we can do , then you will not find anyone anywhere who can match them , let alone surpass them . ”

61847	61853	61892	61892	Purple	108	“ Here is finer cloth , ”
61879	61891	62064	62064	he	160	" That should prove to you that finer weaves are possible , ”
62060	62063	62089	62089	he	160	“ Humph , ”
62083	62088	62089	62089	he	160	“ You are right , ”
62092	62108	62121	62121	Purple	108	“ This is a fine piece of cloth - why do n't you use this ? ”
62109	62119	62127	62127	He	108	" Because I have n't got enough of it , ”
62136	62144	62156	62156	Lesta	160	“ I want you to match this . "
62145	62154	62156	62156	Lesta	160	“ Why should I even bother to try ? "
62158	62173	62181	62181	Purple	108	“ If you want cloth that fine , go where you got that piece . ”
62174	62180	62181	62181	Purple	108	" I 'm trying to ! ”
62184	62206	62283	62283	I	0	“ I want to go home . I am marooned in a strange land , and I want to go home . ”
62288	62300	62301	62301	Lesta	160	“ You can not weave cloth like that , can you ? ”
62308	62313	62318	62318	he	108	“ What was that ? ”
62314	62317	62318	62318	he	108	“ No , ”
62321	62335	62349	62349	I	0	“ No , I can not . Nobody can . It is demoncloth . ”
62336	62348	62349	62349	I	0	“ But if you could learn to weave cloth like that , ”
62352	62368	62381	62381	he	108	" that would make you the greatest weaver in the land , would n't it ? "
62369	62380	62381	62381	he	108	“ I am already the greatest weaver in the land ! ”
62384	62387	62388	62388	I	0	“ Oh , ”
62391	62412	62349	62349	I	0	“ but what would happen to you if another learned how to make cloth like this pas He stopped breathing . "
62420	62443	62349	62349	I	0	" He did n't answer . He glared at me , at Purple , at me again . Abruptly he regained himself . “
62446	62450	62459	62459	Purple	108	” he said . “
62457	62458	62472	62472	he	108	" “
62482	62523	62472	62472	he	108	" Lesta bristled . He started to turn away , then turned back . He opened his mouth to speak , then closed it . He started to gesture to Purple , then pulled back his hand . He glared . “
62530	62534	62472	62472	he	108	” he repeated . “
62560	62575	62579	62579	Lesta	160	" At that Purple turned back to us , still fastening his impact suit . “
62581	62585	62597	62597	I	0	” he said . “
62590	62595	62597	62597	I	0	" Lesta looked pleased . "
62606	62680	62704	62704	You	160	" Lesta stopped looking so pleased . He swallowed hard . Suddenly he no longer had any choice in the matter ; the alternative was to lose face — and his position as head weaver . We went to examine the looms . Purple 's claim that he could teach a finer quality of weaving was accepted , but his insistence that he be allowed to examine the looms met with some resistance . "
62699	62703	62704	62704	You	160	” Lesta shrugged , “
62712	62713	62715	62715	I	0	" “
62719	62723	62734	62734	I	0	” said Purple . “

62740	62741	62755	62762	a weaver who will show me his looms	1415	" “
62764	62972	62755	62762	a weaver who will show me his looms	1415	" At that the old weaver relented and led us toward his secret clearing . Only weavers were allowed to enter it . That Lesta was willing to break a generations - old tradition showed how important he considered Purple 's cloth . As we approached we could hear the sounds of great creaking machinery , shuddering and protesting . This was alternated with shouts and commands — it made a steady rhythm : a shout and a shudder , a command and a creak . We entered the glade and caught our first sight of the looms . They were heavy wooden structures - giant moving frames set at odd angles to each other . They rocked steadily back and forth at each command , and it looked as if the cloth appeared between them . Some of the looms were covered with spiderweb traceries of threads , others with halfpieces of brown undyed cloth stretched across them . The team leader caught sight of us then , and his command stuck in his throat . The frameworks halted in their busy motion , slowed and came to a stop . Their flashing threads were stilled . The novices and journeymen turned to stare as one . “
62977	62981	62755	62762	a weaver who will show me his looms	1415	” said Purple ; "
62990	63194	63206	63206	I	0	” Lesta snapped orders at his weavers . They looked at him 137 138 THE FLYING SORCERERS questioningly - Weave ? With strangers here ? He growled menacingly . I could see why he was head weaver . The apprentices went nervously back to work . The team leader swallowed and issued his command , the looms began grinding again . The young men sweated as they pushed the heavy wooden frames back and forth , back and forth , while the younger boys played a form of catch with a ball of yarn between the two frames . I had never seen weaving before , and I was entranced by the process . Lesta explained it : there are two vertical sets of threads , each set in a separate frame and independent of each other , but interlocked in such a way that they alternate . The horizontal threads are laid on one at a time , the frames are moved so as to reverse their positions , and another horizontal thread is strung . Purple nodded slowly , as if he understood everything . Perhaps he did . He examined a sample of the cloth they were weaving and asked , “
63204	63205	63229	63229	I	0	" "
63240	63249	63229	63229	I	0	" Purple ran his fingertips along the cloth . “
63259	63260	63229	63229	I	0	” “

63584	63659	63563	63563	I	0	” We all shook our heads again . While Purple continued to describe his mystical sticky substance to them , I moved closer to examine the looms . The weavers looked at me with ill - concealed hostility , but I ignored them . The teeth of the looms were carved from hardwood limbs . Each section was about one hand - length and set into a slot at the top of the frame . “
63668	63672	63563	63563	I	0	” I asked . “
63683	63692	63706	63706	We	1421	” quavered the apprentice I had spoken to . “

63793	63865	63872	63872	You	0	” I examined the frame again , climbing up on the platform to do so . I wanted to check the slot to see how each piece was fastened . Yes , it would be possible to carve bone to fit into that slot . I pulled out a measuring string and began tying measuring knots into it . Abruptly Lesta saw what I was doing and broke away from Purple , "

63922	63937	63909	63909	I	0	” He looked up at me , Purple and Shoogar moved up behind him . “

64154	64206	64147	64147	You	0	" We looked . The framework had a half - finished piece of cloth on it . It was a small piece of cloth , less than one half the width of the loom , but at its edges the threads stretched and spread evenly to every tooth on the frame . “
64209	64213	64219	64219	You	0	” said Lesta , "
64233	64260	64281	64281	I	0	" Purple had gone over to examine the cloth . Lesta followed . I jumped down from the platform and ragtagged over . Lesta was saying : “

64289	64293	64303	64303	I	0	" Purple said . “

64407	64422	64446	64446	You	0	” repeated the weaver . Shoogar was standing right behind him . He said , “
64434	64445	64446	64446	You	0	” The old man paled . He whirled on Shoogar , “
64450	64458	64446	64446	You	0	” Shoogar was rolling up his sleeves , “

64469	64514	64542	64543	old man	1426	” Lesta eyed him warily . Obviously he did n't . He took a step back , then another , a third and he bumped into Purple . He jumped away and looked at us , glanced nervously at his looms , then said , “
64536	64537	64542	64543	old man	1426	” “
64545	64557	64565	64565	Lant	71	” Purple boomed . He clapped the weaver on the back . "
64574	64866	64565	64565	Lant	71	" I was delighted . If nothing else , I would unload most of that runforit skeleton after all . What luck ! The carving of the teeth would take care of most of the flat bones and all I 'd have to worry about then would be the hundred and twenty - eight ribs . Now , let 's see , I 'd probably still have to sand some of the pieces flatter , then carve slits into them — the best way might be to use a cutting thread to slice very narrow lines . H’m , it would be like carving a bone comb , but faster because I would not have to carve so deep . I could use a framework of cutting threads , and cut all the slots in a section at once . If I measured it precisely enough , each section would be the same as every other one . The same as every other one — that was an interesting thought ! If one broke , you could replace it immediately ; there would be no delay in carving a new piece to fit . You could always keep a couple of extras around . That seemed practical . Hmm ... I wondered ; I might be able to finish the teeth even sooner if I could find some apprentices — but no , there was not enough free labor in either of the villages . The only thing we had an excess of was women - and most of them were less than useless . We discussed some of the details for awhile longer , until at last Purple stretched his arms over his head and stared up into the sky . “
64869	64874	64565	64565	Lant	71	” he yawned , ' "
64883	64884	64893	64893	My	0	" “
64888	64892	64907	64907	I	0	” I said . “
64918	64958	64959	64959	I	0	” We climbed toward the Upper Village . We were far enough past the interpassage that there would be a period of darkness between red sunset and blue dawn . Shoogar might even get a glimpse of the moons . “
64969	64973	64974	64974	I	0	” I said . “
64979	64983	64984	64984	I	0	” Shoogar muttered . “
64996	64997	65001	65001	you	1429	" “
65004	65011	65012	65012	You	1429	" I said impulsively to Purple . “
65017	65018	65019	65019	I	0	” “
65025	65619	65019	65019	I	0	” he said . As we entered the Upper Village we could see Damd the Tree Binder preparing the virgin tree for cultivation . A wild housetree is a thick sturdy giant with pliable limbs ; it must be bound and strengthened before it can hold a house . The lowest branches must be softened and treated , and then bent into the ground to grow into roots . The upper branches must be twined together to form a cradle for the nest . Within a hand of days the nest weaver can begin his work . At Wilville and Orbur 's insistence , Purple ate with me and my family . Ordinarily , I would never have invited him anywhere near my nest , but the alternative was to publicly refuse — and that might have offended the men of the Lower Village . As it turned out , I need not have feared . Purple and Wilville and Orbur were so excited about their project that they spoke of nothing else throughout the whole meal — and we were having fresh sea leeches too ! The three of them argued back and forth about methods of construction and the principles by which the machine would work . I tried to follow as best as I could , but most of it was beyond me at last I had to give up and turn my attention instead to calming my nervous wives . All this talk of flying machines and airbags was upsetting them enormously . The two of them twittered nervously in the background and refused to approach except at my sternest command . Finally , I had to threaten to beat them and refuse them our table scraps . Shoogar had been invited to join us too , but he had declined . Instead , he had spent the whole twenty minutes of darkness up on Idiot 's Crag , straining to catch a glimpse of ve fear their project are argued to havingothing THE FLYING SORCERERS 143 the moons . At blue dawn he was furious . Only one of the three largest moons had shown , and that only for a second as two clouds parted . Shoogar had been unable to tell which moon it was . It was just as well . I knew what he wanted from the sky , and I would be just as glad if he never found it . Purple had never seen a cultivation before . He stood and watched as Shoogar offered the seventeen blessings in Quaff borrowed from the Lower Village . ' Shoogar was relaxed as I had not seen him relax since his confrontation with Purple . It did him good to get his mind off the complexities and unknowns of a flying spell . A cultivation is mostly a simple rote reciting , so basic and foolproof that even the position of the moons can not change it . Purple watched politely while Shoogar chanted in his brightly marked robe and heavy headdress , prayer shawl and beads . When Shoogar sprinkled the quaff at the base of the tree , he muttered something about comparative somethings and fertility rites . Demon words again . At last we reached my favorite part of the ceremony . All of the women and children shed their clothes and began dancing around the newly sanctified tree , singing , and painting stripes round and round the trunk in bright colored dyes . Purple 's interest immediately perked up . “
65625	65629	65019	65019	I	0	” he asked . “
65632	65640	65673	65673	Purple	108	” I did n't understand his question . "
65669	65670	65675	65675	They	1431	” “
65682	65683	65786	65786	they	1431	” “
65687	65783	65786	65786	they	1431	" Purple 's naked face turned pink . He watched a bit longer , then gradually lost interest in the ceremony . It did go on for a very long time . He wandered off morosely . It was only when Shoogar got to the tree - bleeding that 144 THE FLYING SORCERERS Purple 's attention returned . He was sitting dourly off to one side , lost in thought . Now , as Damd the Tree Binder began tapping into the veins of the tree and Shoogar began chanting again , he looked up . “
65790	65792	65786	65786	they	1431	” . "
65797	65961	65786	65786	they	1431	” shouted one of the children derisively . What kind of a magician was this , who did not even recognize a simple cultivation ceremony ? We watched patiently as Shoogar blessed the blood of the tree and anointed the tied limbs and roots - to - be . Guided by Damd 's ropes and Shoogar 's chanted instructions , the lowest limbs would become additional sections of trunk . The higher limbs , which had been bent downward and tied together , would grow into a strong circular framework for a nest . The spell was nearing completion when Purple abruptly stepped into the middle of it . He brushed through the circle of chanting women and ran a finger through the blood of the tree . The chanting stopped instantly . We stood frozen in shock , wondering why Purple would break a treespell . And Shoogar , furious , reached for a pouch at his waist . Thoughtfully Purple said , “
65972	66017	66021	66021	you	1433	" He turned to Shoogar , his sticky fingers outstretched . Shoogar was taken aback . He hesitated , he forgot the pouch in his hand , and doubtless he remembered his oath . But his voice was thick with fury as he asked , “
66030	66031	66034	66034	you	70	” “
66039	66053	66058	66058	I	0	” Purple rubbed the sticky substance between his palms , savoring its feel . “

66092	66183	66208	66208	I	0	” The murmur of voices around him should have told Purple why not . It did n't , of course . I stepped quickly through the crowd , took Purple by the arm and led him out . He stumbled along with me almost in a daze , he was murmuring excitedly in his own tongue . Behind his back I signaled Shoogar to start the ceremony again . I moved off to one side with Purple and tried to get some sense out of him . THE FLYING SORCERERS 145 “
66218	66220	66233	66233	Housetrees	162	” . “

66275	66280	66251	66251	you	108	” He looked puzzled . “
66286	66298	66317	66317	we	1434	" He went back to examining the sap on his hands . “
66320	66321	66317	66317	we	1434	” “
66324	66328	66345	66345	You	108	” he gasped . “

66461	66536	66552	66552	you	108	" I sputtered . There had to be a way out of this mess . Purple was desperate to fly ; but Shoogar and the villagers would never permit housetree sap to be so defiled . A duel was in the offing , unless A weird thought occurred to me . I would have dismissed it instantly , even with my layman 's knowledge of magic . But Purple was so oddly unorthodoxI said , “
66567	66568	66552	66552	you	108	" "
66577	66578	66589	66589	you	108	” “
66581	66586	66589	66589	you	108	" I was incredulous . “
66593	66594	66589	66589	you	108	” “
66598	66613	66614	66614	Sap	163	” There was an odd expression on Purple 's face , a delighted expression . “
66618	66619	66626	66626	you	108	” “
66628	66640	66626	66626	you	108	” but he was n't listening . He was fidgeting impatiently . “
66643	66647	66654	66654	I	0	” he said . "
66674	66675	66702	66702	you	108	” "
66704	66705	67052	67052	Lant	71	” “
66718	67046	67052	67052	Lant	71	” And off he went . It was the right answer , of course — but I was still surprised : Purple was so unorthodox . By the time I had finished the first set of loomteeth , Purple and Shoogar had finished their first set of experiments with wild housetree sap . Purple knew what he wanted to achieve , and Shoogar knew best how to achieve it . The heated sap could be treated with certain other magician 's chemicals to make a putrid and foul smelling soup . Cloth could be dipped into this soup , and it would form an airtight seal . However , the seal was neither as tight nor as permanent as Purple had wished and so they continued to experiment . On the day I began carving the third set of loomteeth , Purple announced that he had reached a solution to the problem of weaving a watertight cloth . Instead of dipping the whole cloth into the housetree soup , he would dip the spun threads before they were woven . When the thread dried it was impregnated with the sap and it had a smooth and shiny feel . Cloth woven from these treated threads could then be treated in a modified housetree - binding solution and dried again . The threads , already soaked with housetree blood , would swell and join and become one solid material , impermeable to air and water . Purple was delighted . If thread could be woven fine enough , and if my bone loomteeth would work as expected , THE FLYING SORCERERS 147 then surely we could weave a cloth light enough and tight enough for the flying machine . By the time I had finished the third set of loomteeth , Lesta had already woven several swatches of fine aircloth for Purple . It was smooth and shiny , and the weave was almost invisible to the eye . “
67054	67092	67052	67052	Lant	71	” Purple exclaimed ... I had to admit that it was . Old Lesta beamed with pride . Purple had been running from person to person , stopping them , and demanding that they feel his cloth . “
67116	67138	67052	67052	Lant	71	” He was so overcome with emotion , he could not finish the sentence . Lesta was only slightly more subdued . “
67141	67145	67164	67164	We	1437	” he demanded , “

67256	67273	67274	67274	Betrayer	1438	” said Purple . His face was red and blue and several other colors at once . “

69241	69256	69265	69265	Purple	108	“ We have not the men to spin , and not enough to weave ! ”
69258	69264	69265	69265	Purple	108	“ I do n't understand — ”
69275	69293	69238	69238	Lesta	160	“ You have enough spinners for all your other types of weaving — why not for aircloth ? ”
69294	69412	69427	69427	Purple	108	“ Because aircloth is n't just woven ! The thread has to be spun fine and dipped , then it has to be dried . That requires three times as many men working on spinning . Then after 152 THE FLYING SORCERERS and a patch such worn , the cloth is woven , it has to be dipped again . That 's a whole new step ! Where am I to get the men for such work ? It takes almost twice as long to weave a patch of aircloth as it does to weave anything else and that patch is only one fourth the size of what we could be weaving because you want it compacted ! ”
69413	69425	69434	69434	Lesta	160	“ It would not be aircloth if it were n't compacted , ”
69429	69432	69434	69434	Lesta	160	" Fine , ”

69487	69507	69434	69434	Lesta	160	“ It takes nearly a hand of days to spin enough thread for a single patch of the stuff . ”
69508	69516	69434	69434	Lesta	160	" Well , then bring in more spinners= ”
69517	69555	69483	69483	Lesta	160	" And where am I to get them ? I can not ask my weavers to accept such a demotion , and there are not enough boys in either of our villages to take on as apprentices . "
69556	69569	69434	69434	Lesta	160	“ Why not hire spinners from the other villages on this island ? "
69570	69581	69601	69601	I	0	“ What?—and let them have the secret of aircloth too ? ”
69582	69600	69601	69601	I	0	“ They would not have to know about the final step of the dipping of the cloth , ”
69604	69619	69483	69483	Lesta	160	“ Hm . You are right there — but they will never do it . ”
69620	69624	69483	69483	Lesta	160	" Why not ? ”
69625	69634	69601	69601	I	0	“ What would their weavers do for thread ? ”
69635	69643	69483	69483	Lesta	160	" Hire their weavers to help spin . "

69792	69799	69804	69805	153 Ang	86	“ We can not do it , ”
69810	69823	69987	69987	Lesta	160	“ We can not do it - I have not enough nets . "
69824	69829	69987	69987	Lesta	160	" Weave some more . "
69830	69852	69804	69805	153 Ang	86	“ I can not do it — it will take too long to weave enough nets to feed that many people . "
69853	69861	69987	69987	Lesta	160	" Perhaps Lesta 's weavers can help . ”
69862	69878	69987	69987	Lesta	160	“ Nonsense , we cannot - my men do not know how to weave nets . "
69879	69891	69804	69805	153 Ang	86	" It 's a form of weaving , is n't it ? ”
69892	69897	69987	69987	Lesta	160	“ Of course , but- "
69898	69911	69987	69987	Lesta	160	“ Then they can learn . Ang , will you teach them ? ”
69912	69917	69987	69987	Lesta	160	“ Yes , but , "
69918	69976	69987	69987	Lesta	160	“ There are no buts about it . If we spend the next hand of days just weaving nets for Ang , by the time the new weavers arrive we should be able to feed them regularly . By that time we will have enough aircloth thread on hand to demonstrate the proper weaving techniques to them . ”
69977	69984	69987	69987	Lesta	160	“ We can not do it — "
69990	69994	69987	69987	Lesta	160	“ Why not ? "
69995	70114	70120	70120	Purple	108	“ I have been figuring . We have enough fiberplants and fibertrees . We will have more than enough thread . As long as there are wild housetrees , we will have the sap — we do not have to worry about these things . But we still do not have enough spinners in proportion to the weavers . Our problem now is that we are not producing enough aircloth thread to keep our own weavers busy — if we bring in new weavers and spinners , we will only be multiplying our own problem by five . We will have five times as many weavers sitting around idle waiting for thread . We can not do it . ”
70115	70118	70120	70120	Purple	108	“ Nonsense , ”
70122	70138	70146	70146	Lesta	160	“ The problem is that we have not enough people spinning , that 's all . "
70139	70144	70146	70146	Lesta	160	" That 's all ? "
70148	70184	70196	70196	Purple	108	“ Is n't that enough ? If we ca n't find enough people in our own village to make a significant difference , do you think we will be able to find them in another ? ”
70185	70194	70222	70222	he	108	" I have been doing some figuring too , ”
70229	70273	70306	70306	Purple	108	“ Now , using our present number of weavers and looms , at the rate of one patch of aircloth . 154 THE FLYING SORCERERS produced per hand of days , it will take almost 12 years to make enough for my needs . "
70286	70305	70306	70306	Purple	108	“ Sure , it 's fine stuff , but who needs it if it takes that long to weave ”
70311	70354	70362	70362	Lesta	160	“ Now , if we bring in all the weavers and all the spinners of the other villages on this island , that multiplies the rate of production by five and cuts the waiting time down to two and a half years . "
70355	70360	70362	70362	Lesta	160	“ Oh , fine , "
70364	70386	70398	70398	He	108	“ I 'm not sure I could survive even one more year of Purple , let alone two and a half . "
70401	70465	70472	70472	Lesta	160	“ Now , let 's consider the problem - it 's not that it takes such a long time to produce a piece of aircloth that is delaying us , not at all — it 's just that we do n't produce enough of it . If we had more looms and more men to operate them , we could produce larger amounts . "
70466	70470	70472	70472	Lesta	160	“ Of course , ”
70474	70495	70527	70527	Purple	108	" and if I were a bird , I could fly — and I would n't need aircloth at all . ”
70534	70572	70627	70627	Purple	108	“ I have figured this out very carefully . Counting all the weavers in all five villagesand counting all the journeymen and all the novices — and even all the apprentices , there are more than enough — "
70573	70578	70586	70586	Purple	108	“ Pfah ! Nonsense ! ”
70579	70585	70586	70586	Purple	108	“ _ more than enough , ”
70589	70597	70627	70627	Purple	108	“ If all of them are weaving . "
70598	70623	70642	70642	his	108	“ And who will spin the thread for them if all are weaving ? Little creatures will come in at night and do it ? ”
70648	70670	70586	70586	Purple	108	“ Not at all . First off , I 'm surprised you did n't ask where they will weave this cloth . "
70671	70682	70642	70642	his	108	“ Without the thread it does n't make any difference . "
70683	70769	70783	70783	I	0	“ Let 's take this one thing at a time . If every man who is a member of the weaver 's caste could become a full - fledged weaver , and if we had enough looms for all of them and each man worked a full day at his loom , we could make as THE FLYING SORCERERS 155 . much aircloth as I need within four - huh , let 's see - huh , well before Lant 's wife delivers her child . ”
70770	70782	70788	70788	Lesta	160	“ A little more than two hands of hands of days , "
70795	70848	70854	70854	Purple	108	“ Purple , you 're a fool that 's 175 looms we 'd need . We have but six in this village . Where are we supposed to get the rest ? You 'd change us from weavers to loom builders — and we 'd be building for the next five years . "
70849	70852	70854	70854	Purple	108	“ Wrong , "
70856	70878	70879	70879	He	108	“ And you exaggerate besides . First of all , we do n't need 175 looms . We only need 60 % "
70890	70910	70788	70788	Lesta	160	“ — we only need 60 , but we will use them continually , all day and all night ! ”
70918	70931	70939	70939	Purple	108	“ Use them continually ? Are we to give up sleeping now ? "
70932	70937	70941	70941	He	108	“ No , no — ”
70946	70980	70986	70986	Purple	108	“ Listen , you only work during blue days , right ? When the blue sun sets , you stop . Well why ca n't you work just as well during red daylight ? "
70990	71107	71131	71132	The weavers	1393	“ Look , the light is just as bright at night as it is during the day . One team of men can work at night , another team of men can work during the day - we'll call them shifts . That way we only need one third as many looms . Each man still works a full shift , but they do n't all have to work during blue day . Why should the looms stand empty and unused when there is light ? One shift will work in the morning , another in the evening , a third during red morning , a fourth until red sunset . Each shift will work nine hours ”
71116	71130	71131	71132	The weavers	1393	“ You 'd have us violate the weaving spells ? Defile the gods ? ”

71339	71380	71403	71403	Lesta	160	“ But what I do know about weaving suggests that the time of day the cloth is woven is unimportant . However , if there is any serious concern , I can construct some modifying spells to alleviate any danger . ”
71397	71401	71403	71403	Lesta	160	“ But still , "
71405	71412	71426	71426	Purple	108	“ Purple has called for sixty looms "

71428	71507	71548	71548	he	160	“ You have six . Each of the other four villages has at least that many . Lant tells me that Hinc and some of the weavers of the Upper Village have already built one of their own . That is thirty - one right there .

71577	71593	71604	71604	Lesta	160	“ Well , it takes time to carve them -almost four days per full set . "

71606	71639	71648	71648	I	0	“ That means more than 240 days of carving by Lant before there are enough teeth for all of the looms — and what will we do about breakage in the meantime ? ”

72006	72043	72078	72078	He	108	" I ca n't even give you an idea . It 's a totally new situation for me . I 'll guess four hands of days , maybe more , maybe less — how 's that ? ”

72344	72443	72478	72478	Lesta	160	“ Listen , there is nothing sacred about spinning - even old Lesta admits it . The only reason you use boy apprentices to do it is that there is no weaving for them to do . Well , now that there is weaving for them to do , they do n't have to spin any more . The success of this whole plan depends on using the women for spinning — and your apprentice weavers can move up to being novices . Your novices can be promoted to journeymen . Your journeymen will all become team leaders . "

We no longer treat our women as poorly as our ancestors did because we are beginning to understand them — and because of it , we are getting better usage out of them . Harder work , Lesta ! “

79357	79403	79405	79405	I	0	“ Well , each one would be a promise , Lant - a promise of a future spell . The person could keep it or trade it as he sees fit , or he can redeem it later when I have the time for it . ”

79561	79584	79591	79591	I	0	“ Yes , yes , a good idea , Lant . We can give one spell token for each day 's labor . ”

79594	79634	79635	79635	He	1702	“ One for each five days of labor . That is THE FLYING SORCERERS 175 the way Shoogar works — it makes his spells worth more . ' Work for a hand of days , earn a spell . ' ”

79956	80007	80014	80014	I	0	“ Yes , we can build you a device for cutting many slices of bone at a time . We will use cranks and pullies , and it will be operated by two apprentices . I think we may be able to pull fifty threads at a time with it . "

80026	80062	80075	80075	Orbur	78	“ As soon as we have a chance to build it — first we must finish the airboat frame . The spirit pine is too heavy — we are going to try again with bambooze . ”
80063	80073	80356	80356	I	0	" And that means building a whole new frame , "

80532	80550	80502	80504	My second wife	1725	“ Kate is my name . I have a name . Purple has given it to me . ”

There was only me to stop them as they streamed toward the river , toward PurpleI pushed and fought my way to the front of the crowd so that they could see me . “

81719	81724	81668	81668	he	108	“ For naming women ? ”
81725	81779	81787	81787	I	0	“ Purple , you 're a magician — you should have known 180 THE FLYING SORCERERS better ! I suppose you named them right out in public , in the hearing of others , so that every woman who spins now knows the names of every other woman ! Well , did you ? ”
81780	81786	81787	81787	I	0	" Certainly . Why not ? ”
81790	81848	81859	81859	he	1758	“ Because they 'll use magic on each other ! And magic is too powerful to be placed in the hands of fools and women ! They 'll get above themselves , Purple ! First you have given them a profession , now you give them names . They 'll think they 're as good as men ! "
81849	81858	81859	81859	he	1758	“ It bothers you , does n't it ? ”

83375	83409	83372	83372	He	70	“ By their very definition names are part of the object which they are the name of . You ca n't separate the two . A flower is a flower is a flower . ”
83410	83426	83372	83372	He	70	“ Nonsense , Shoogar ; a flower by any other name is still a flower ! ”
83427	83469	83372	83372	He	70	“ Wrong , Lant — it 's only a flower because you call it a 184 THE FLYING SORCERERS flower . If it were n't a flower , it would be something else . It would be whatever you named it ! "
83470	83479	83372	83372	He	70	“ But it would still smell the same ! ”
83480	83489	83372	83372	He	70	“ But it would n't be a flower ! ”
83497	83543	83372	83372	He	70	“ I 'm sorry , Shoogar , but these names can not be retracted . The best thing we can do is deconsecrate them and make the best of a bad situation . Make the women spellproof . Let the names be only meaningless words . "
83544	83621	83626	83626	I	0	“ That 's just it , Lant . There are no meaningless words . All words have meanings , whether we know them or not . There can be no words that are not also specific symbols of the objects they are names of — and a symbol is a way to manipulate the object . When Purple says we must deconsecrate the names , he is talking foolishness . You can not deconsecrate a name . ”

83721	83782	83807	83807	he	1830	“ Yes , Lant , there is . I will simply consecrate every woman with the same name . Therefore no one will dare cast a spell on anyone else 's woman , because he will also be casting a spell on his own . And no woman would dare curse another because she would be cursing herself as well ! ”
83783	83790	83795	83795	he	1830	“ Shoogar — you are brilliant ! "
83791	83794	83795	83795	he	1830	“ Yes , "

85127	85135	85136	85136	He	108	“ Is there a standard punishment for — "

85292	85313	85289	85289	he	70	“ The word is Purple 's . Purple tells us that a theft is an offense where he comes from . “
85337	85348	85373	85373	magicians	363	” There was a murmur of agreement . Shoogar continued , “
85375	85391	85373	85373	magicians	363	” This time the Speakers agreed heartily . Shoogar was taking them off the hook . “
85401	85416	85428	85428	I	0	” said Shoogar , advancing on the boys . They shrank away from him . “
85435	85467	85428	85428	I	0	” And with that he unfurled the huge bolts of cloth the boys had taken from Purple . They were long strips , the first ones sewn together for the airbags . “
85473	85477	85428	85428	I	0	" commanded Shoogar . “
85483	85512	85428	85428	I	0	" began Purple . Shoogar ignored him . The head weavers shoved the boys forward and forced them onto the ground , flat on the strips of cloth . “
85517	85521	85537	85537	Shoogar	70	" said Shoogar . “
85528	85534	85537	85537	Shoogar	70	” The weavers did so . "
85539	85543	85550	85550	I	0	" Purple protested , "
85548	85549	85550	85550	I	0	" "
85557	85573	85550	85550	I	0	” said Shoogar , not taking his eyes from the struggling bulks in the cloth . “
85584	85626	85634	85634	They	1906	” Shoogar threw him a glance . He may have remembered the word , but what of it ? Oxygen was the gas Purple threw away when he made hydrogen from water . Throw - away gas . THE FLYING SORCERERS 189 "
85629	85633	85640	85640	You	70	” he said . “
85638	85639	85640	85640	You	70	" “
85644	85715	85735	85735	You	70	” said Purple . He was quite pale . Shoogar turned away with a grimace . Purple made a sound in his throat . I thought he would go after the other magician ; but he did not . The boys were completely bound up now , the weavers were tying the cloth firmly about them . They looked like giant sting thing larvae , long and brown and shapeless . “
85730	85734	85738	85738	men	294	" said Shoogar . “
85747	85765	85738	85738	men	294	" When the boys were unrolled , they were stiff and dead . Even Shoogar was shaken . “
85770	85777	85735	85735	You	70	" He shook his head slowly . “
85785	85791	85870	85870	I	0	” He circled the bodies . “
85807	85869	85882	85882	I	0	" We looked . Their faces were dark and cold . Their tongues protruded , and their eyes bulged in amazement ; but of wounds there were none . When we told Purple , he made a sound of pain — but as if he had expected it , I thought . He went down to the clearing himself to see . “
85877	85881	85882	85882	I	0	" he said . "
85888	86040	86083	86083	I	0	" When he saw their stiff forms , he recoiled . He sank down upon a log and buried his head in his hands and sobbed . Even Wilville and Orbur edged away from him . The fathers of the boys arrived then . They had been summoned from the other side of the island , and it had taken them almost a day to make the journey . When they learned what had happened , they began to wail . They had come to participate in a punishment ceremony , not a funeral . I myself felt strange , empty , taken with a terrible sense of loss . Gortik gathered up the thefted cloth , handling it with new 190 THE FLYING SORCERERS respect , and presented it to Purple . Purple raised his head , looked at the offering . He shook his head vehemently , shrinking back . "
86049	86082	86091	86091	They	1912	" In the end , we buried the boys in it . Afterward I found Purple alone . He was sitting morosely on the unfinished airboat frame . He looked at me , “

86218	86232	86233	86234	Savage societies	1914	" he said . He stopped then and looked at me . Speechless . “
86236	86240	86244	86244	you	108	" I asked . “
86253	86254	86259	86259	Lant	71	” “

86309	86348	86350	86350	they	1917	” He covered his face . Suddenly , I was calm . Purple was outside all human experience . We had been assuming things about him just as he had been assuming them about us . I asked , “
86360	86366	86381	86381	Advisors	75	” He shook his head . “
86399	86404	86381	86381	Advisors	75	” I was impressed . “

86902	86958	86969	86969	Purple	108	" Cloth and spell chips . Yes . Until your coming , one could not theft enough cloth to be worth the effort . So much cloth did not exist . And how could one theft the services of a 192 THE FLYING SORCERERS magician ? The idea was nonsense until you arrived , Purple . "
86959	86967	86969	86969	Purple	108	“ I 've invented a new crime , ”

88672	88725	88793	88793	He	108	" Hot air . Hot air is lighter than cold air . That 's why smoke rises . The cursed trouble is that hot air gets cold . We 'd sink into the sea and stay there ; we could n't possibly get far enough north in a hot - air windbag . "
88741	88792	88793	88793	He	108	“ Surely there must be some way , Purple . It was not so long ago that you thought an airboat was impossible . Is there nothing you can do about your battery ? There must have been a first source of electrissy some time . How was it done ? ”

89409	89413	89388	89388	we	1998	” he said , “

89730	89797	89800	89800	you	2015	” He was trailing off into gibberish . What he needed was another bowl of Quaff . Me too . . We trudged up to the Upper Village , and climbed into my nest . I dug out a fresh bladder . Purple took the first swig . Somewhere along the way he 'd lost his bowl , so he drank it straight from the bladder . "
89807	89833	89800	89800	you	2015	" I asked . Purple lowered the skin from his mouth . He gave me a dignified look of reproach and staggered to his feet , “
89843	89884	89887	89887	God	140	” Somewhat unsteadily , he lowered himself from my nest and together we tottered through the village to one of the largest housetrees that of Hinc the Lesser . Purple took another swill of the Quaff and surveyed it thoughtfully . “
89893	89897	89932	89933	them girls	2021	” he asked . “
89935	89936	89932	89933	them girls	2021	" "
89939	89943	90081	90081	Dorthi	108	" said Purple , “
90018	90070	90081	90081	Dorthi	108	" He mumbled on and on like this . I took another drink of the Quaff and followed him back to his nest . He disappeared up into it , still mumbling . A hail of objects , vials , potions and other magical devices began falling out of the nestdoor . “
90073	90077	90107	90107	I	0	” Purple bellowed . “

90145	90180	90375	90375	Lant	71	” After a bit he dropped out of the nest himself , landing unsteadily on top of the by now large pile of spellcasting items . He started gathering them into a large pack . "
90212	90237	90252	90252	I	0	” Again we surveyed Hinc 's tree . The sun was red in the west . We had perhaps an hour before blue dawn . "
90247	90251	90375	90375	Lant	71	” I asked . "
90273	90363	90390	90390	I	0	” He took another drink of Quaff . The bladder was badly deflated by now . He hiccuped and pulled out a clay mixing bowl . He began mixing a potion , changed his mind abruptly and discarded it . He started another , but poured that one out too — it sizzled on top of the first . Finally he started mixing powders and things in his pottery bowl . Pottery . I wondered if I should be insulted . Purple sniffed his mixture and wrinkled his nose . “
90382	90389	90390	90390	I	0	" Abruptly he straightened and announced , “
90395	90424	90439	90439	Purple	108	" He lifted his robe and looked around for a bush to step behind . There were none . He looked at the bowl before him , shrugged , “
90428	90438	90439	90439	Purple	108	” There was a hot spattering into the bowl . “
90441	90445	90486	90486	Lant	71	” I cried , “
90470	90481	90502	90502	I	0	” 200 THE FLYING SORCERERS He lowered his robe modestly , “
90492	90501	90502	90502	I	0	” He reached for the Quaff , explaining , “
90508	90528	90502	90502	I	0	" He drank , then returned the bladder to me . He hefted his spell - potion bowl carefully . “
90540	90548	90502	90502	I	0	" I lowered the skin and said , “
90553	90554	90502	90502	I	0	” “
90562	90624	90642	90642	we	2027	" Immediately he began singing and dancing in a circle around Hinc 's tree . On his second round , he almost tripped over his robe , but fortunately he caught himself before he fell into his bowl . Quickly he divested himself of the robe , and picking up the bowl once again began dancing around the tree and singing , "
90655	90691	90768	90768	Hinc	133	" I wondered if I should tell him that it was not a prickly plant he was deconsecrating , but a housetree , when suddenly Hinc shoved his head out of his nest and shouted , “
90698	90704	90768	90768	Hinc	133	" He wrinkled his nose , “
90712	90713	90733	90733	Hinc	133	" "
90718	90727	90735	90735	We	2027	" Purple called as he came around again . “
90742	90743	90768	90768	Hinc	133	" “
90748	90764	90768	90768	Hinc	133	" Hinc 's neck - fur bristled . He dropped angrily out of the nest . “
90770	90774	90768	90768	Hinc	133	" I said . “
90784	90922	90768	90768	Hinc	133	” He did and we did . We told him how we were short of housetree blood , how Purple needed it desperately in order to complete his flying machine and leave this world . We told him how desperately Purple wanted to go home , and how he was doing Purple a great favor . We told him how it would only be for a day or two , and then Shoogar would be glad to reconsecrate the tree . By the time we finished telling him , Hinc was almost as drunk as we . He nodded agreeably as Purple gathered up his bowl again and began singing and dancing around the tree , sprinkling it gently with the potion . We watched for a bit and could n't help laughing . Purple called out , “
90932	91023	91029	91029	I	0	” THE FLYING SORCERERS 201 We looked at each other and shrugged . Hinc dropped the robe he was holding about himself and easily joined Purple . After pausing for a moment to finish the Quaff I did too . When we had finished deconsecrating Hinc 's tree , we found we had potion left , a lot of it , so we moved on to the tree of Ang the Fish - Farmer and Net - tender . He peered out of his nest at the noise and shouted , “
91034	91055	91029	91029	I	0	" Almost immediately he dropped out of his tree , stripping off his clothes , but Purple had stopped singing . “
91068	91069	91029	91029	I	0	” “
91078	91097	91029	91029	I	0	” cried Ang . He disappeared back into his nest and reappeared almost immediately with another full bladder . "
91105	91124	91129	91129	Lant	71	" After we had danced about his tree five times , Ang suddenly turned to me and asked , “
91136	91141	91129	91129	Lant	71	" I told him . “
91144	91204	91220	91220	you've	108	" was all he said . Whatever the magician wanted was fine with him . We kept on dancing . The noise awakened several other people nearby , and they joined us , with Quaff . We deconsecrated their trees for them too , and were about to start on mine – when abruptly we were out of potion . “
91225	91400	91433	91434	The Gods	143	" So we made some more potion . This time , though , we all provided the defiled water . By this time the sun was close to rising , we could see the blue - black glare of it behind the horizon . Most of the men in the village were awake now and eagerly joining the line to put defiled water into the potion pots of which there were several now . We passed around the everpresent Quaff bladders . As soon as one was emptied , another full one seemed to appear from nowhere . The new arrivals kept bringing them . The wives watched nervously from the nests . And then we were ready to resume the dancing and singing . We danced and sang around every tree we could , until the sun flashed over the horizon . We danced and sang in the harsh blue light until it disappeared behind a cloud bank and abruptly we were in the midst of a raging rainstorm . 202 THE FLYING SORCERERS “
91409	91432	91438	91439	The Gods	143	” We skipped down the slope and began to dance around Purple 's housetree and the seven giant airbags hanging over it . “
91443	91447	91455	91457	All the Gods	2032	" We sang , “
91461	91555	91455	91457	All the Gods	2032	" Lightning and thunder shattered the sky — the warm drops felt good against our naked fur . And thenA crackle of shattering brightness our hair stood on end -a giant KKK - R - R - R - ummmmppplll And a ball of orange flame enveloped Purple 's airbags , housetree and all . For a moment I stood petrified - had we gone too far ? Was Elcin about to destroy this village too ? And then it was over , and silence reigned . Only the quiet spattering of raindrops . “
91558	91565	91571	91571	you	2033	” said Purple in the stillness . "
91578	91598	91618	91618	Lant	71	” When I awoke , the crimson sun was glaring . Shoogar was standing above me , also glaring . “
91601	91617	91632	91632	Shoogar	70	" I said and groaned . The sound of my voice hurt my left eye . “
91620	91631	91632	91632	Shoogar	70	" he replied . His voice hurt my right eye . “

To do that meant that all the other work would have to wait until he could bless it . We would just have to pass out spell tokens to the housetree owners until Shoogar could redeem them . Like Purple 's , they would be promises of future spells , and he could catch up later . “

Harder and harder — it was a pocket hurricane ! It was coming from Orbur , coming from that whirling bladed device ! I stumbled back with my arm across my eyes . My sons laughed .

94295	94462	94710	94710	I	0	” I went . Wilville and Orbur were right . aves . Somebody must oice . Somebody miner . You will see I trudged back down the hill toward the village . Spread below me was another facet of the airboat 's construction . Great swatches of cloth had been spread out across an unused slope and Grimm the Tailor was sewing them together to make the first of Purple 's giant airbags . This was cloth that had already been treated in houseblood and tested for its watertightness . As it was sewn together , the seams would also be treated . The cloth was light and airy , and a gusty wind swept across the hill making ripples in its surface , despite the weights that were holding it down . I had not realized that we were this far along . I had imagined many more hands of days before we had enough cloth . Apparently , Purple 's prophecy had been correct , “
94489	94709	94727	94727	I	0	” Now , all of a sudden , the airboat was almost complete , the first of the bags was being finished and Purple was making a large - scale gasmaker . As I approached I noticed Shoogar also was working with Grimm . He was holding a copy of- of Purple 's bluedrawings ! He seemed to be directing something . When I came closer I realized that Shoogar either had figured them out or — No , it soon became apparent . He was directing the transference of the pattern onto the cloth . Knowing that the bag would form a sphere when inflated , Shoogar wanted the proper spell markings on it . Accordingly , he was using the best flying spell available — Purple 's . After all , were n't the blue - drawings the airship itself ? Would n't it be necessary to have blue - drawings on the balloon in order to make it lift ? Shoogar had taken on two apprentices , and they were painting the lines in wide swatches . I continued on down to the village , where I ran into a disgruntled group of villagers . They were setting up tents 209 210 THE FLYING SORCERERS othest I could . As you were here beneath their housetrees . “

94941	95090	95110	95110	Shoogar	70	” I said . I hurried back to my work area and quickly stained some bone chips blue . I directed my assistants to stain as many blue ones in the future as purple ones . We would need both . I returned to the villagers and began distributing the tokens . There was a little more grumbling about the houseblood - gathering teams . Some villagers felt that the magicians had no right to take their housetree blood , even if it was a prickly plant now . I paid them a purple token for Purple , and they were satisfied . They disappeared into their nests to sleep . I wandered downward to the weaving pastures . The weavers were grumbling because Shoogar had not shown up today to offer the morning blessings . I gave them some blue spell tokens in lieu of the blessing . “
95115	95162	95328	95328	Ang	209	" They eyed the blue chips warily . They had n't liked the purple ones that much , but they had been forced to accept them . Now they were having another chip introduced , and they liked it even less . I prevailed upon them . “
95211	95327	95349	95349	I	0	” . Glumly they did so . Now they were getting paid in blue chips and purple chips . I pocketed the balance of the tokens ; I was carrying several of each , and wandered back up to the village . Here and there were a few people I had missed earlier in the day , still moaning about not wanting to live in prickly plants . I gave them some tokens , blue ones for the reconsecration spell , purple ones for the use of their housetree blood . Having solved those problems , I felt that I had earned my pay as Speaker and went downslope to see Ang the Net Tender . "

95619	95718	95598	95598	they	2113	" Something about that troubled me . While my wives prepared the flatfish for dinner , I realized what it was . People 212 THE FLYING SORCERERS were trading those spell tokens as if they were the actual spells themselves . But they were n't . They were only the promises of the spells . But then again , a promise is a symbol of an act , and a symbol is the same as the act itself . They were trading magic ! It suddenly occurred to me that it was possible for a magician to make enough “
95720	95815	95598	95598	they	2113	” to release an inordinate amount of magic into the village . There would have to be controls of some kind . Oh well , it was Shoogar 's problem now , not mine . Three days later , Grimm finished the first of the giant airbags and began working on the second . Shoogar and Purple , Wilville and Orbur had already claimed the first one and folded it carefully over the giant filling framework that Wilville and Orbur had built so many hands earlier . Three other filling frameworks waited empty nearby . “

98786	98820	98782	98782	his	70	“ No , Orbur — if you have windmakers then obviously you are planning to use sails . The windmakers will make wind and push the sails , and the boat will move . "
98821	98841	98782	98782	his	70	" No , Shoogar — the windmakers push the air backward and the airboat moves forward . Without sails . "
98843	98866	98782	98782	his	70	“ Without sails , what will they have to push against ? The boat wo n't move at all through the air . "
98867	98873	98782	98782	his	70	" The boat will move . "

98914	98955	98966	98966	Shoogar	70	“ Yes ! We have tested the windmakers already — and when both Wilville and I are pumping as hard as we can the boat seems to edge forward as if it could hardly wait to leap into the air . "

99022	99030	99143	99143	He	70	“ And where will we put masts ? ”

99158	99179	99143	99143	He	70	“ It 's sand - ash wood . We 're using three thin planks to add stability to the floor . "
99184	99199	99143	99143	He	70	" It 's too thin . We ca n't possibly mount masts in it . "

99206	99217	99143	99143	He	70	“ We 'll have to hang them from the outriggers . ”

99278	99288	99290	99290	Shoogar	70	“ You 'll have to put them in front , "
99292	99338	99398	99398	Shoogar	70	“ Plenty of room if you do that . Put the masts and sails in front of the windmakers , then pedal in reverse . The wind will blow forward , into the sails . You 'll be facing in the direction you 're going . "
99339	99348	99356	99356	Shoogar	70	“ But pedaling in reverse is hard work ! "
99349	99355	99356	99356	Shoogar	70	“ Then reverse the gear ! ”
99359	99371	99381	99381	Orbur	78	“ Do I have to do all your thinking for you ? ”

99405	99439	99444	99444	Orbur	78	" Set the masts now , put the sails on before you leave . Then you 'll be prepared for anything . If the sails do n't work , you can take them offl "

99568	99600	99537	99537	he	70	" Now then , Lant , we have to get straight on this matter of the spell tokens . The blue tokens are obviously not being properly appreciated by the villagers . "

99708	99798	99804	99804	Shoogar	70	“ Well , Shoogar — it is well known that you do much more work than Purple . You do most of the spellcasting in the village , and Purple hardly does any . That makes Purple 's magic much rarer and worth a lot more . The people know that they can always redeem your coins for spells — but Purple 's magic is rarer , and hence they seem to think that it is more valuable or else he would use it as freely as you do .

100223	100269	100270	100270	He	78	“ Yes , yes , I think that . But try it anyway . What harm can it do ? There is only one way Shoogar will ever be convinced that we do n't need sails . We 'll have to let him try it . "

103718	103939	104010	104010	Purple	108	” Shoogar was bouncing around the base of the launching cradle , barking at the men struggling to tie more mooring ropes . Heavy wooden stakes were being pounded into the ground . Other men came running across the slope - each carrying two heavy ballast bags with him . They swung ominously back and forth . Trone the Coppersmith brought four . The ballast bags were also made of aircloth , and filled THE FLYING SORCERERS 231 with sand . Purple had realized their need only a hand of days ago , and Grimm had had to hurry to sew them up . Trone had taken the responsibility of seeing that they were filled . Now the men came jumping up onto the cradle and practically threw the bags at Wilville and Orbur - Orbur slipped under their weight and disappeared again into the bottom of the boat . There was a muffled curse . The bags had been finished and waiting since this morning . Purple said they were needed to provide extra weight that was expendable as the gas leaked out . A thought occurred to me why had n't he put them in the boat as they were finished , instead of waiting till the last moment like this . It certainly would have been easier . “
103946	104009	104010	104010	Purple	108	” He was calling . The men took off again , dashing to get another load . Wilville and Orbur staggered to stow them evenly . Purple then jumped into the boat to help . He grabbed the ballast bags as each one was brought up , and directed their distribution about the craft . . I jumped up on the cradle . “

As soon as I cut it , that side of the boat leapt upward , throwing it into a violent slant . Purple and Shoogar screamed excitedly , “

I ran back to the first side and cut another rope , but now the front of the airship was hanging lower than the back , and so I had to cut another and meanwhile all of them were screaming , Wilville and Orbur , Purple and Shoogar , Trone and the ballast crew , the roiling crowd - even Lesta , upset because the ropes had been bound from his finest cloth . And then there was only one rope left — the airboat was pointed severely at the sky . I cut it and It leapt upward , and there was a great echoing cheer from the crowd . I collapsed on the cradle , rolled over on my back , and watched them shrink into the sky . I was glad that there had not been more ropes . I was panting heavily . "

114839	114843	114837	114837	Me	0	” he answered . "

114884	114891	114837	114837	Me	0	” they called . He sighed . “
114895	115032	115046	115046	We	2658	" The wind was strong this high in the sky . Idiot 's Crag had shrunk to a spear of black on the horizon . Below us the sea was many colors . Spots were brown and opaque with mud . In some places reefs showed through . There were groves of submerged trees as well , spines of mountain rock , and even a tall cairn to Musk - Watz . You could see them all sticking out of the water . There were churning whirlpools and vast rippling tides , and the surface of the water was gray and foamy . Purple was sighting against the sun and marking something on a skin which had been stretched across a framework . Strange lines speared out from the center of the skin to its edges . “
115041	115045	115055	115055	I	0	” explained Purple . “
115053	115054	115055	115055	I	0	" "

115105	115145	115240	115240	We	2658	” Purple leaned far over the edge and tried to follow it with his eyes . I feared for his balance , but even more I feared for Shoogar who watched us with eyes gleaming . He straightened then . “
115160	115239	115240	115240	We	2658	" They nodded and began to do so . First one of the bladed wheels swung down to hang a manheight below the preand even at tali aimen THE FLYING SORCERERS 257 carious outrigger , then the other on the other side . I shuddered as I watched . I would not trade places with either of my sons . You would not get me out there , with nothing between me and the sea but empty air . “
115246	115250	115240	115240	We	2658	” called Purple . “
115261	115336	115240	115240	We	2658	” I did n't understand that last , but the boys apparently did . Wilville began backpedaling while Orbur pedaled forward . Slowly the Cathawk turned in the sky . The red sunlight seeped through the rigging , and the shadows shifted across our faces . Purple watched carefully on his measuring skin . A small rod stuck up from the center , and he watched the position of its shadow . He called , “
115342	115358	115240	115240	We	2658	” . He waited until both airpushers were still , then checked the shadow again . “
115362	115366	115240	115240	We	2658	” he called , "
115371	115387	115240	115240	We	2658	” When we were finally pointed in the right direction , he gave another order . “
115391	115470	115240	115240	We	2658	” he called . The two boys began chanting and pedaling . They had removed the extra twist in the pulleys , so that the airpushers blew their wind sternward again and the boys faced in the direction they were going . The chant was at a set rhythm , and they pedaled in time to it . Purple watched them for a while , then he peered over the side again . After a bit he said , “
115473	115477	115542	115542	You	71	" He straightened . “
115517	115541	115545	115545	Lant	71	” . He went to the back of the boat then and stretched out on a cot of aircloth over a wide frame . “
115547	115551	115586	115586	Purple	108	” he called , “
115580	115581	115586	115586	Purple	108	” “
115588	115593	115612	115612	Lant	71	" I reassured him . “

115634	115642	115645	115645	I	0	” He pounded himself on his stomach . “

115664	115668	115669	115669	Sh	239	” muttered Shoogar . “
115671	115675	115669	115669	Sh	239	” I hissed . “

115760	116031	116033	116033	they	2673	" Shoogar snarled at me and went forward to the front of the boat . I sank down tiredly on a pile of supplies and blankets . For a while I watched my sons as they pedaled . It was a funny sight , a bicycle so high in the air- with no wheels at all , yet they were pedaling so steadily , I had to laugh . They glared at me , but kept chanting and pumping . Above us the clustered windbags were like a distant roof . Large enough to be covering , but high enough so that they were not oppressive . It was a feeling like being sheltered , but also one of being strangely free . Occasionally the boys rested — and then all was silent . That was the most peculiar thing about the airship . Once in the sky , it neither creaked nor shuddered . There were no sounds at all , except perhaps that of our own heartbeats . We had stopped rising now . And a good thing too . The air was cold - almost biting . Purple pulled out some blankets and passed them around . Wilville and Orbur were wearing extra layers of clothing . It had been tied to their outriggers so they could pull it on as they wished . They also had water bottles and packs of hardbread . There was no need for them to come into the boat itself at all , if they did not wish to . The last of the red sun finally seeped below the horizon . “
116041	116046	116128	116128	you	2675	” I asked Purple . “
116124	116126	116137	116137	you	2675	" - “
116139	116140	116223	116223	I	0	” “
116228	116750	116765	116765	Lant	71	” In the dark the steady chanting and pumping was an eerie thing — coming , as it did , from outside the boat . Fortunately , the time till blue dawn was little more than an hour away — we would have naught but a brief flash of darkness at this time of year . Followed by seventeen hours of pure blue sunlight , an hour of double sunlight , and another seventeen hours of red sunlight . Then darkness again . Later in the year the darknesses would stretch , as would the times of double sunlight . The single - sun hours would shrink as the suns moved closer and closer in the sky - toward the inevitable red conjunction . We pedaled on through the darkened sky . Far to the east the horizon 's edge was limned by a faint blue glow . Blue Quells was sneaking up behind it , soon to shout and leap and flash brightly over the edge . Below , the sea was a dark platter , greasy and wrinkled . A cold wind whipped around us . I pulled my blanket tighter against it . The boat rocked gently . The swollen balloons seemed motionless above ; the sea motionless and flat so far below . My sons pedaled steadily . I fancied I could see the churned air stretching out in a line behind us , but that way was as dark as the way ahead . Their pumping was a steady sound , sensed rather than heard - a constant vibration filled the boat . And then it was morning , sharp and blue_bright Ouells was a pinpoint at the edge of the world , sleeting light sideways across our eyes . Wilville and Orbur rested then , while Purple sighted for the spine of land under the water . It was a barren range of hills , barely higher than the land around it . Beneath the risen ocean it would appear with a lighter color . 260 THE FLYING SORCERERS At first he thought we had lost it , then he sighted it off to our right . Apparently , during the dark , the wind bad slackened somewhat . The boys , having no way of knowing this , had kept pedaling , and so had carried us farther west than Purple had wanted us to go . Fortunately the wind was still blowing northeast , so Purple told Wilville and Orbur that they could rest until such time as we were again over our guide . The boys climbed into the boat , but did not remove their waist ropes until they were safely inside . They sucked eagerly at a skin of Quaff , passing it back and forth between them , then each stretched out on a cloth - lined framework , the Cathawk 's equivalent of a cot . Within moments they were asleep . I picked my way forward , past bundles of supplies . Shoogar was just stretching and yawning . He greeted me with a surly - grunt . "
116756	116760	116775	116775	I	0	” I asked . “
116785	116790	116791	116791	I	0	” he yawned grumpily , “

116841	116845	116820	116820	you	70	" I said . “
116853	116872	116881	116881	they	2685	” He was fumbling in his sleeve , but all he found was a damp husk - ball . “
116876	116880	116890	116890	I	0	” he said , "
116900	116912	116919	116919	Lant	71	” he shrugged and tossed the sodden mass over the side . “
116921	117003	117041	117041	I	0	” he mumbled and tottered off . I moved to the front of the boat and peered out . Here was a view , unobstructed by either balloons or rigging . I was suspended above a silvery - blue sea , miles above it . I seemed to be floating in silence . The stillness was overpowering . Deafening . The air was crisp and , at the same time , hot . Blue Ouells was already heating up the day . “
117010	117040	117053	117056	The THE FLYING SORCERERS	79	” I looked around . Purple had come up beside me . He placed his hands on the rail and looked out at the ocean blueness on all sides . “
117048	117052	117108	117108	Lant	71	” he said . “
117071	117107	117108	117108	Lant	71	" I nodded . I did not particularly feel like talking yet . My bones still ached from the cold of the night , and the sun had not yet begun to bake that out .. “
117110	117114	117187	117187	We	2688	” he said , "
117149	117186	117212	117212	We	2688	" I sighed . We had been over this many times already . It was on the basis of our migration that Purple had calculated the number of balloons and amount of supplies he would need . “
117220	117224	117212	117212	We	2688	" He nodded , "
117229	117265	117266	117266	We	2688	" then fell silent and became lost in thought , as if he were making figures in his head . After a while he brought out his measuring skin again and began sighting the sun . “
117276	117280	117287	117288	the boys	4131	" he said . “
117290	117345	117357	117357	you	71	" Afterward , when we were again vibrating to the tune of the whirring bicycles , I tottered aft and joined Purple for a bite of breakfast , my first meal since coming aboard the aircraft . Shoogar was snoring loudly on a cot . Purple bit into a sour melon . He said , “
117362	117363	117368	117368	your	71	” "

Behind us Shoogar 's snoring had stopped - he was lying on his back . His eyes were narrow slits — had he heard too ? The wind had died completely . Purple signaled Wilville and Orbur to take a rest while he measured the suns again . “

117934	118031	118032	118035	Bung - smelling apprentices	2702	” The boys stretched out for a short nap then . Shoogar was up at the front of the boat , offering a chant to MuskTHE FLYING SORCERERS 263 . Watz , trying to restore the wind , and Purple decided to climb up into the rigging to check his balloons . I climbed forward . So far , this journey had been very boring . There had been nothing to do but sit . Shoogar finished with his cantele and sat down on a bench . He began packing away his spell - chanting equipment . “

118724	118883	118884	118884	He	2732	" I shook my head . I did not understand many things in this life — and this was one of them . I wobbled aft to get some sleep . The boat rocked gently under the swollen balloons , and within moments the cares of magicians had slipped away . better negen for it s always . They always plan more care life and led aft to get som and within mo We spent a miserable hour of darkness drifting , all five of us huddled together at the bottom of the boat . Keeping THE FLYING SORCERERS 265 watch would have done little good , There was little to see but black water . After a while Purple gathered his blanket around him and stumbled off . We could hear him pacing back and forth at the stern of the boat , we could feel the pad - padding of his feet through the deck slats . “
118890	118894	118884	118884	He	2732	” murmured Orbur . “
118908	118912	118980	118980	He	2732	” said Wilville . “
118925	118979	118980	118980	He	2732	” I peeked out from under my blanket . Purple was peering upward at the balloons . They were illuminated by the eerie glow of his flashlight . They shone brightly in the dark , ominous and impassive . He was muttering something about hydrogen leakage . Wilville and Orbur exchanged a glance . “
118987	118991	118980	118980	He	2732	” said one . “
118997	119002	119368	119368	Shoogar	70	" replied the other . “
119016	119367	119384	119384	You	0	” I shivered . Below , we could hear the water lap - lapping , and the occasional splash and groan of a cavernmouth fish . Best we do not land at all , I thought - although , if the hydrogen was leaking , we would have no choice at all in the matter . I longed for a fire , blessed warmth , but Purple would allow us none no flame , no fire , no spark - making device of any kind . Nothing that might endanger the violently explosive hydrogen . Had it not been for the ample supply of Quaff , we would have been twice as unhappy and twice as cold . But Shoogar and I passed the flask back and forth between us , and after a while the sun came out and we did n't care any more . Purple sighted our course then , and Wilville and Orbur climbed out onto the outriggers . They turned us in the proper direction and began pedaling across the sky . Purple retired to his sleeping cot in the back of the boat . He snored like an awakening mountain . Shoogar was grumpy again . The few times he had poked his head out from under his blanket during the darkness , there had still been no moons . The first time of dark , there had been mist . The second time had been clear , but there were 266 THE FLYING SORCERERS still no moons ! It was annoying and frustrating : the sign of Gafia , when all the gods have stopped listening . Shoogar was unapproachable . He climbed up into the rigging , onto a little platform Purple called a bird 's nest , and sat there moodily . Later , when Purple awoke , he asked why Shoogar was so angry . I told him that it was the moons . Shoogar needed them and he could not see them — I did n't tell him why he needed them though . Purple called up to him , "

119438	119458	119528	119528	They	2735	” But he began climbing down . Purple pulled out an animal skin and began marking lines on it . “
119516	119527	119528	119528	They	2735	” Shoogar nodded . This much at least was correct . “
119534	119538	119540	119540	they	2735	" he said . “
119552	119553	119540	119540	they	2735	” “
119556	119560	120165	120165	Shoogar	70	” said Purple . “
119622	119739	120341	120341	Lant	71	" I stopped listening and wandered to another part of the airship . I am no magician and shop talk generally bores me . Later though I noticed that Shoogar had kept the spell chart that Purple had made , and was poring over it interestedly . He had a fierce look in his eyes , and was muttering grumpily and happily to himself . Blue dawn of the third day revealed us to be only _ a few manheights above the water . Great swells swept before us , the water rising and falling in constant uneasy motion . As Wilville and Orbur climbed out onto their bicycles they muttered about our lack of height . “
119751	120162	120341	120341	Lant	71	” Orbur said . Purple nodded thoughtfully . He was peering up at his balloons . I was peering uneasily down . The surface of the water was greasy and black , and crinkled with flecks of light . I could see the foam on the waves , and smell the wetness in the air . We had been moving erratically north for two days now , sometimes pushed by the wind , and sometimes by the airpushers . Whenever the flying machine had dropped too low , Purple poured sand out of the ballast bags until we rose again . But we only had one sandbag left , and Purple was beginning to worry . He had been measuring the balloons regularly since the first night . Periodically , he would climb up into the rigging and poke one experimentally , then climb down , tsk - tsk'ing and shaking his head . The windbags were drooping sadly now ; we could see that without climbing the ropes . He spent all morning leaning over the rail trying to estimate the distance to the water below . I spent long hours leaning over the rail myself , but little of it was in contemplation of the water . The continual height bad begun to unnerve me — and the motion , the constant sway of the boat , the uneasy rocking whenever someone shifted his positionIt was Purple 's observance of me that gave him the idea of how to measure our height . He would drop an object and time how long it took to fall . He could do that even in the dark if he listened carefully for the splash . After his latest calculation - made by dropping a sour 267 268 THE FLYING SORCERERS melon over the side — Purple announced that we were losing gas very rapidly and would have to pump up the balloons as soon as possible . He climbed up into the rigging then , while Wilville and Orbur manned the bicycle frames . Hopefully , he said , after we came down in the water , the propellors would keep us balanced and headed in the right direction . He began untying the neck of one of his windbags . He hung from the ropes above us , a puffy figure against a background of limp and bloated cloth , and he called instructions to the rest of us . “
120196	120273	120341	120341	Lant	71	" Carefully , he manipulated the long hose - like neck of the windbag , and let some gas seep out . We sank toward the watere let more gas ocells in the rigshish are the won the water , the edge . We low high are He let more gas out , then tied the neck of the bag again . He readjusted himself in the rigging and grabbed another bag . We continued sinking . “
120279	120330	120341	120341	Lant	71	” he called . I looked over the edge . We were less than one manheight above the water . Already the propellors were slashing across the tops of the swells , dipping in and out of them , churning them to froth . A foamy wake appeared behind us . “
120343	120387	120341	120341	Lant	71	” Purple called . I wobbled to the back of the boat to where the rudder was mounted . It too was an aircloth - hardened frame . I straightened it out , and looped a rope around it to hold it so . "
120393	120671	120674	120674	We	2740	” I looked again . We were still one manheight over the water . We had stopped sinking . Purple loosed a little more gas from the bag and we sank , sank — oof!--smacked into the water , slid sickeningly downward , then up again , across the tops of the swells , up and down , up and down . Wilville and Orbur kept pedaling . Amazing ! The airpushers kept churning the water behind us , and we moved steadily forward — the airpushers worked in water too ! What a marvelous device they were ! Purple then unslung the hoses from the windbags , so that they hung down into the boat frame . Sixteen long nozzles — I looked up and thought of a milkbeast 's belly . THE FLYING SORCERERS 269 Purple brought out a wooden frame which Pran the Carpenter had made for him . There was a slot in it to hold the battery . Two copper wires led out across separate arms . One of them ended in a clay funnel . To this Purple attached the first balloon nozzle . He hooked the whole affair over the boat rail and let the wires and funnel arm dip into the water . He made an adjustment on his battery . From the oxygen wire came the familiar furious bubbling . We could not see the bubbling on the other wire , it was inside the funnel . But we did see the gentle puffing of the balloon neck , and we knew that the gas was leaping upward through it . Suddenly there was a yelp from Orbur , "
120679	120739	120674	120674	We	2740	" Sure enough , we were . The annoying up - and - down motion of the boat across the swells had stopped . We had swung back into the air . I could see our shadow slipping across the water beneath us . Only the propellors still skimmed through the surface , and then they too were free . “
120743	120747	120674	120674	We	2740	" said Purple . “
120754	120777	120795	120795	We	2740	" There was a wind pushing us along . We watched glumly as our wake disappeared behind , lost in the swells . “
120784	120794	120795	120795	We	2740	” I asked . He switched off his battery . “
120798	120799	120828	120828	I	0	” “
120826	120827	120837	120837	I	0	” “
120842	120880	120837	120837	I	0	” He began looking around him . He laid aside the recharging framework and started rearranging the supplies in the bottom of the boat ; checking and tying the aircloth covers to see that they were secure . “
120886	121025	121026	121026	We	2742	” he called . There was one in the bow of the boat . We had been using it to hold wash water , but it was empty now . Shoogar brought it back to where we waited .. As soon as we were skimming through the tops of the swells again , Purple leaned far over the rail , the bucket trailing in his hands . He pulled it up , half full , and emptied it into the boat . Again be leaned over the edge . When he had poured ten bucketsful into the boat we were again splashing through the waves . Another ten bucketsful and we were dipping into the troughs . Ten more and we were firmly in the water . Up and down . Up and down . 270 THE FLYING SORCERERS “
121030	121034	121026	121026	We	2742	” he explained . “
121043	121101	121109	121109	I	0	” He peered over the side and measured how low the boat was riding in the waves . He poured fifteen more bucketsful into the boat before he was satisfied . It was up to our knees at its deepest point . He picked up his battery and funnel device again and started to lean over the side “
121117	121288	121302	121302	We	2743	” He sat down on a clothcovered seat and placed the device in the water before him . It began bubbling and he beamed delightedly . We were all delighted . On all sides splashed the restless ocean . If Purple 's gas - making magic were to suddenly stop working , we would be trapped here , a tiny craft bobbing across an uncaring sea . Whether Purple worried about this or not , I did not know . Apparently he had full confidence in the power of his battery and he worked steadily . Within seven hours , he had recharged all sixteen balloons . They hung taut and full - bellied overhead . Several times we had added more water to the boat to offset their increased lifting power . There were more than a hundred bucketsful in the boat now . At last though , Purple tied off the last windbag , and began disconnecting his battery wires . He tsked thoughtfully as he did so , “
121309	121324	121302	121302	We	2743	" He put the device aside and began gathering up the empty ballast bags . “
121330	121334	121335	121335	We	2743	” he instructed . “
121345	121419	121335	121335	We	2743	” While Shoogar and I did as he instructed , he began bailing the water out of the boat . After fifteen bucketsful had been poured out , the boat began rocking harder in response to the waves . A few more bucketsful and we were splashing through them , the swells smacking the bottom of the boat . A few more and we were level again while the water skimmed harmlessly below . “
121426	121435	121335	121335	We	2743	” Purple called to Wilville . Wilville nodded , “
121442	121491	121493	121493	you	2744	” He and Orbur were still on their bicycles , still hanging down onto the sea — they were pumping steadily , and keeping the airpushers spinning to maintain our heading in the proper direction . THE FLYING SORCERERS 271 Purple bailed one last bucket and straightened up . “
121502	121511	121525	121525	Lant	71	" I asked . He shook his head . “
121527	121592	121525	121525	Lant	71	” He put the pail aside . While I scratched my head in confusion , he splashed forward to the Cathawk 's toolbox . He came back carrying a drill , and proceeded to make a small hole in the narrow deck slats . It took only a few moments , and then he stood up proudly and wetly . Almost immediately Orbur called , “
121601	121662	121679	121679	you	2746	" Indeed we were . The ocean dropped away at an ever increasing pace . The water spilled out of the hole at a steady rate , and gradually there was less and less water in the boat . Like Purple 's first windbag so many hands ago , we fell upward . I leaned over the railing in excitement . “
121673	121677	121693	121693	you	71	” I said . “
121688	121689	121693	121693	you	71	" “
121696	121700	121693	121693	you	71	” said Shoogar . “
121709	121710	121693	121693	you	71	" "
121742	121743	121693	121693	you	71	" “
121747	121751	121693	121693	you	71	” commented Shoogar . “
121763	121764	121766	121766	you	2749	" “
121768	122019	122100	122100	I	0	” Purple beamed . It was the first compliment he had ever gotten from Shoogar . He checked our course heading then — the wind was blowing almost directly north - so the boys could either rest or pedal in the same direction , as they chose . They chose to rest and stretched out on their outriggers . There had to be one son on each outrigger at all times , or no son on eitherotherwise the airboat slanted all askew . Purple dried himself off as well as he could , then climbed into the rigging to tie up the airbag nozzles . They were still hanging down . By the time he had finished , all the water had drained out of the boat . He toddled back to where we waited and pounded a heavy bone plug into the hole . Once more the sea glistened far below us . Indeed , it seemed we were higher than ever . When we dropped a sour whates the bankingclas , no bume it was 272 THE FLYING SORCERERS melon over the side , it dwindled to a distant speck and vanished without a splash . We were aloft for the rest of that day and most of ' the next , before we again had to dump ballast . Purple always waited until we had sunk below a certain level before he would throw any away . Otherwise , he said , we were just wasting it . “
122031	122099	122100	122100	I	0	” he explained . We were standing in the front of the boat looking down at the glass - colored water . All was blue and red with the fairy - tale quality of double daylight . Above , massive cloudbanks covered half the sky , the multi - colored sunlights painting them in gaudy hues and stark relief . Purple eyed them with a worried frown . “
122107	122179	122184	122184	you	0	” he said . The blue sun hesitated on the horizon , then winked out , leaving everything rose - colored . The silence of the upper air was perfect , but for the sSSSSSS of the bicycles and the low chanting at the rear of the boat where Shoogar was trying to change the direction of the wind . It was northeast again , and the boys were pedaling west . “
122191	122198	122276	122276	We	2750	” I asked . Purple shrugged , “
122274	122275	122276	122276	We	2750	" “
122284	122289	122276	122276	We	2750	" I pointed out . "

122301	122305	122307	122307	I	0	” he admitted , “
122311	122332	122344	122344	Your	2753	” He sighed and sank down onto a bench . THE FLYING SORCERERS 273 I sat down across from him . “

122484	122496	122498	122498	Purple	108	“ All the time we had those damned sails , up , "
122500	122559	122649	122649	Elcin	84	“ we were powerless to fight the wind , so we were blown even farther away . Shoogar did n't want to let us bring them in , but we would have never gotten home otherwise . Once we got organized though , we made good time , and later on the wind gave us a push too . "
122560	122574	122498	122498	Purple	108	“ You were n't over the island the whole time , were you ? "
122575	122614	122631	122631	I	0	“ Oh no . Just before we started pedaling for home we were getting very close to the mainland . There was a very excited crowd there on the beach , but we did n't try to approach . ”
122615	122630	122673	122673	he	108	" It was well that you didn't — they might have stoned you or worse "
122669	122672	122673	122673	he	108	“ Thunder ! "

122684	122691	122772	122772	He	108	" Thunder means lightning , Lant ! "
122797	122802	122817	122817	he	108	“ What is it ? ”
122813	122816	122817	122817	he	108	“ Thunderstorm ! ”

123529	123704	123501	123501	His	70	” And with that , he snatched them up and heaved them over the side . Shoogar began screaming curses , but they were lost in the loudest crash of all . The spare windbags followed the sails , as did half our food and water . Wilville had emptied all the ballast bags by now and was helping Purple . We were still falling . A sickening sensation in the pit of my stomach told me we were about to die . Purple called for me to unreel a windbag nozzle , but not to untie it . What was he planning ? He grabbed it as it fell , and hooked it to his funnel . He had a ballast bag between his legs ; he plunged the nozzle and battery device into the bag of water . I saw him turn the battery up to its maximum release of electrissy . Great gulps of gas roared up the hosethe windbag expanded terrifically . 276 THE FLYING SORCERERS Purple waved to Wilville . “
123711	123715	123501	123501	His	70	” he bellowed . “
123721	123858	123865	123865	We	2765	” I could see long streamers of foam below us . We were falling at little more than a fast gallop — the sea was a wall of blackness — I could see the individual waves Cra - a - ack — the boat smacked down with a great splash that sent water in all directions . For a sickening moment all the ropes were slack — then they snapped taut again as the balloons leapt back . There was a yelp from behind me Shoogar- I turned in time to see Orbur lose his grip and fall into the water , but he surfaced again almost immediately and began paddling for an outrigger . Wilville was climbing down from the rigging then to see if Purple was all right , but the magician was screaming : “
123874	123875	123877	123877	you	2766	” "
123883	123954	123877	123877	you	2766	” pointed Wilville . Purple looked , saw his battery and funnel device lying in a puddle of water at the bottom of the boat . The puddle boiled . Purple yelped and leapt for it . The boat rocked as Orbur climbed into it , his fur plastered wetly to his body . He started up the rigging to join us , then stopped . He cocked his head oddly- "
123959	123963	123877	123877	you	2766	” he called . “
123971	123972	123982	123982	you	2766	” "
123975	123979	123982	123982	you	2766	” Purple cried . “
123984	124005	124016	124016	We	2767	" Then he stopped too . There was a distant cough of thunder . Behind us . Far behind us . “
124011	124015	124023	124023	We	2767	” said Orbur . “

124028	124208	124215	124215	Purple	108	” muttered Shoogar . He began climbing down . The bird 's nest , where he had been holding onto it , was bent out of shape . The rolling sea lifted us up and dropped us down . Lifted us up and dropped us down . The boat lay askew in the water . One of the outriggers THE FLYING SORCERERS 277 had snapped halfway off and had to be retied before we dared to ascend again . Wilville and Orbur were working on it now . The balloons - nearly empty now - drooped flaccidly above us . They had barely enough gas to hold themselves aloft . We had been sitting in the sea for half a day now . The red sun was seeping into the west , and the day was ever darkening . Purple sat glumly in the rear of the boat with his battery and his filling framework . Shoogar was half - heartedly bailing water . Apparently we had sprung a small leak somewhere . I staggered aft , stumbling once . “
124217	124226	124238	124238	I	0	" I asked . He shook his head . “

124508	124519	124535	124535	We	2769	” He started to shake his head to that , then- "
124544	124564	124605	124605	Lant	71	” He stood up , began looking around for things to throw overboard . He tugged at a bundle . “

124607	124615	124675	124675	Lant	71	” he said to my shocked expression , “

124704	124715	124791	124791	Orbur	78	” He began dropping armloads of it over the side . “
124719	124790	124794	124794	you	78	” I protested , but he ignored me — the Quaff went too . We stumbled forward , looking for other things to throw out . The sea rolled around us , rocking the boat and carrying away our hard - won treasures . Our Quaff . The blankets followed the food , all but three - which Purple agreed might be necessary . He picked up a twisting tool , “
124799	124803	124794	124794	you	78	” Orbur nodded . “
124806	124821	124791	124791	Orbur	78	” said Purple . It splashed over the side . He moved forward again . “
124826	124827	124791	124791	Orbur	78	" “
124831	124835	124791	124791	Orbur	78	” yelped Shoogar . “

124874	124905	124986	124987	The outrigger	4671	” snapped Shoogar . For a moment I wondered if maybe Purple was n't considering throwing Shoogar over too . But instead he thrust his spell kit back at him . “
124953	124985	124986	124987	The outrigger	4671	” Shoogar took his kit and examined it carefully . Purple stumbled forward and began to empty out the small cabin framework there . Wilville climbed back into the boat then . “
124991	124995	125033	125033	I	0	” he announced . “
124998	125032	125042	125042	Orbur	78	” said Purple , dumping an armload of things . He wobbled back to us and began throwing the tools overboard . THE FLYING SORCERERS 279 That done , he straightened and said , “
125060	125095	125042	125042	Orbur	78	" Orbur nodded and started to climb the rigging — that is , he tried to what happened was that he pulled the balloon down to where the rest of us could reach it . “
125098	125102	125129	125129	I	0	" said Purple , "
125111	125128	125129	125129	I	0	” He attached the hose to the funnel and battery and lowered it into the water . “
125138	125166	125167	125167	You	78	" he said to no one in particular and switched on his battery . While he worked the rest of us began to fill the ballast bags . “
125173	125184	125185	125185	We	2776	” said Purple when he saw what we were doing . “

125232	125297	125229	125229	I	0	” He turned back to his gas making . After two balloons had been filled , Wilville and Orbur climbed out onto the outriggers and began pedaling . The boat rode up and down the ocean swells . Five balloons later , it stopped riding the waves . Instead , the water just slapped at the bottom . Shoogar and I exchanged a glance . “
125306	125328	125229	125229	I	0	” he said and reached for the bucket . I helped him for a bit , then something occurred to me . “
125338	125342	125229	125229	I	0	" I asked . “
125354	125371	125229	125229	I	0	” As I spoke I was already tugging . There was a yelp from the stern . “
125374	125394	125229	125229	I	0	" shouted Purple , but it was too late . Water spurted up and struck me in the face . “
125401	125405	125229	125229	I	0	” Purple cried . “
125409	125410	125229	125229	I	0	” “

125428	125445	125449	125449	Lant	71	” He dropped his gasmaker and came splashing back , slipped in the water and fell . “

125456	125470	125475	125475	I	0	” The water was rapidly filling the boat and I began to understand . “
125487	125788	125799	125799	Purplel	244	” And then we were all down on our hands 280 THE FLYING SORCERERS and knees feeling around for it under the rising water . It was cold and it surged into the boat eagerly — a spouting fountain marked the spot where the hole was . We scrambled around frantically in that cold wetness and then suddenly I had it — something small and round and hard . The plug ! I tried to jam it back into the hole , but the water was up to my thighs already — I went down on my knees , but then I had to stretch my neck to hold my head above water , and after a few seconds even that did n't work . Shivering , I took a deep breath and went under . I pressed hard on the plug , but I could n't get the leverage , and the water continued to pour in too fast . There was another pair of hands on top of mine - Shoogar's — he was trying to help . But it was n't working — Even the two of us could n't press hard enough . I surfaced for air . Wilville and Orbur were shouting at me from their outriggers . They were up to their necks in water already — and still pedaling furiously . Purple was bailing frantically with the bucket . And then the water stopped rising . It was up to our chests , and waves were sloshing over the sides of the boat . We had stopped sinking . The windbags held the boat just a few hand's - breadths from total immersion . We stood there up to our chests in cold sea water and glared at each other . I said , “
125803	126054	126060	126060	You	2779	” He glared at me . Shoogar glared at me . Wilville and Orbur glared at me . The bags of wind hung over us , the restless sea tossed around us . The red sun began to seep behind the horizon . We had perhaps an hour and a half of daylight leftWell , since nobody else was going to do anythingI trod water to the center of the boat and ducked under . I came up with a ballast bag , pulled it to the rim - I could not have lifted it without going under - opened the mouth and poured the ballast over the side . I ducked , found another bag and emptied it . Purple began to laugh . Shoogar had gotten the idea and was helping me empty the bags of water overboard . It was n't enough . The windbags tugged upward on the boat frame , but they could n't lift it . THE FLYING SORCERERS 281 They could only keep it from sinking into the uneasy swells . Shoogar searched around for some more ballast bags , ducking under and feeling around with his hands . The dumping of ballast did not help noticeably . The rim of the boat frame continued to show only as an outline in the water . Purple had been clinging to the rigging and chortling helplessly while we worked . It seemed a singularly rude act . Now he found his voice and said , “
126069	126070	125799	125799	Purplel	244	" “
126076	126080	126094	126094	you	2779	” said Shoogar . "
126098	126105	126094	126094	you	2779	” He swam over to us . “
126115	126164	126094	126094	you	2779	” I looked at the plug in my hand and shrugged . Why not ? -1 ducked into the water and felt around for the hole . There was no pressure to fight this time , and the plug slipped in easily . I surfaced with a gasp . "
126169	126190	126209	126209	You	2779	” asked Purple . I nodded . He dove under to check it himself . He came up beside me . “
126199	126208	126229	126229	We	2780	” He gave Shoogar and me a look . “
126227	126228	126229	126229	We	2780	" “
126233	126238	126288	126288	You	2781	" they called back , "
126244	126287	126288	126288	You	2781	” Grumbling , Purple splashed aft . Shoogar and I grabbed buckets and set to work . We bailed fast and furiously . By the time Purple had two more balloons refilled , we had the water level down to our thighs . “
126291	126295	126377	126377	Purple	108	" I mused , “
126313	126376	126377	126377	Purple	108	" Purple only glared at me . I went back to my bailing . The red sun seeped down behind the horizon , leaving only a festering glow across the western edge of the world . We worked in shivering darkness . The water splashed coldly about our knees . After a while I became aware that we were rocking more noticeably . “
126379	126383	126384	126384	we	2783	" I called , "
126392	126406	126384	126384	we	2783	" He looked up from his battery device , peered over the edge . “
126411	126438	126384	126384	we	2783	” He tied off the neck of the balloon — the tenth to be filled and slogged forward to where we stood . 282 THE FLYING SORCERERS “

126534	126538	126506	126506	You	108	” grumbled Shoogar . “
126541	126596	126597	126597	Our	2783	” said Purple . He sloshed aft for his battery . There was nothing more to say . Shoogar and I paused in our bailing to hang the sodden blankets across the rigging , hoping to dry them out . I imagined that tiny icicles were forming on the ends of my body fur . “
126605	126614	126630	126630	You	108	” said Shoogar , sniffing at a package . “
126620	126629	126630	126630	You	108	” He tossed it soggily over the side . "
126640	126680	126681	126681	Shoogar	70	” I said , but it was a cheerless joke . He did n't appreciate it anyway — this was no time for joking . Purple was just filling the twelfth balloon , and we were miserable and cold . "
126683	126701	126681	126681	Shoogar	70	" I said . He looked at me from where he was huddling in his damp robe . “

126726	126783	126784	126784	Purple	108	” He turned to the railing and looked . I joined him . In the last fading glow of red sunset , we could just make out the black water skimming effortlessly below .. There was no doubting it — and every moment we rose higher and higher . The twelfth balloon was bulging taut overhead . “

127727	127784	127788	127788	him	108	" I - uh , I sort of miscalculated when I filled the windbags . I did n't realize they still had as much hydrogen in them as they did . I have enough power left to fill three airbags . Or to fill four if I do n't want to call my flying egg down . "
127790	127836	127924	127924	he	108	“ That should be enough . We should have at least four days of flying time left before the balloons are too weak again and I 'm out of power . If we ca n't make it by then , we 'll never make it . ”
127929	127975	128049	128049	Shoogar	70	“ Well , it seemed like a good idea , Lant - but I think those hills of yours are too deeply submerged now to be seen . Maybe we 'll be lucky though , and see them again when we get over shallower water . "
128035	128048	128049	128049	Shoogar	70	“ I had thought this trip was going to be over water , ”
128052	128057	128091	128091	He	108	" not through it . ”
128094	128168	128179	128179	Shoogar	70	“ But it was obvious , Shoogar , we should have thought of it sooner - always keep a quantity of water in the boat . It helps us to balance the craft so that it does n't rock so much when we move . It 's there for recharging the airbags — we never have to go down to the water any more . And we can use it as ballast too . ”
128169	128178	128179	128179	Shoogar	70	“ I tell you that that 's nonsense ! ”
128182	128216	128509	128509	he	70	“ Ballast , drinking water , gas - making water , wash water- What kind of a spell is it when you arbitrarily change the name of the object to suit your needs ? ”
128501	128508	128509	128509	he	70	" Well , that 's it , ”
128512	128529	128670	128670	he	70	“ We make it on the gas we 've got left , or not at all . ”
128665	128669	128670	128670	he	70	“ The moons , "
128674	128682	128744	128744	he	70	“ the moons should be visible soon . ”
128740	128743	128744	128744	he	70	“ Umph , ”
128747	128753	128760	128760	I	0	“ I ca n't see . ”

128763	128778	128797	128797	He	70	“ No , Lant , it has n't enough power to reach that far . ”
128779	128796	128797	128797	He	70	“ Attach it to your big battery . That still has some power left in it . ”
128800	128849	128922	128922	Wilville	79	“ I could do that , but it has n't got enough power left in it to turn the flashlight up that bright . Besides , blue dawn will be here in slightly more than an hour . If it is land , we 'll see it then . "

129145	129155	129168	129168	He	108	“ One of the bags must have a leak — ”

129174	129192	129283	129283	Shoogar	70	" No . Maybe it 's that one . Yes , the seam there — see it ? ”
129272	129281	129311	129311	Purple	108	" Throw some ballast ! Throw some ballast ! ”
129306	129309	129311	129311	Purple	108	“ No ! ”
129313	129326	129327	129327	He	108	“ That wo n't do any good . There 's not enough ! ”
129337	129344	129376	129376	he	108	“ Lant , get my airmaker ! ”
129345	129350	129376	129376	he	108	" Where is it ? ”
129351	129364	129453	129453	Purple	108	" In the back of the boat , I think ! Hurry ! "
129461	129467	129616	129616	Shoogar	70	“ Give me the other . ”

129656	129678	129616	129616	Shoogar	70	" said Purple . His face was white , and the bones of his knuckles showed where he gripped the railing . "

129714	129739	129743	129743	I	0	” Purple peered nervously backward . The dark thundering water was slipping steadily behind us . Wilville and Orbur lay clenched across their outriggers . "
129752	129768	129779	129779	My	0	” Shoogar said weakly . Purple grunted thoughtfully . He was looking at his airmaker . “
129774	129778	129782	129782	I	0	" I asked . “

129801	129811	129822	129822	We	2839	" He disconnected the battery and shook it experimentally . “
129831	129832	129855	129855	We	2839	" “
129853	129854	129928	129928	Orbur	78	" “
129876	129925	129942	129942	you	2844	" He put his face in his hands and made sounds of pain . Then suddenly he stood up , picked up the battery and — for an endless moment I thought he was going to fling it overboard and perhaps follow it . Instead he called briskly , “
129950	130181	130187	130187	you	2845	” I could see that he was only acting . He did n't want the others to see how deeply he felt his loss . He pretended to busy himself checking the rigging , but several times I caught him staring off into the sky with a faraway look . The boys unslung the windmakers again and Shoogar 290 THE FLYING SORCERERS began to chant with them — the I Think Icon , a fast chant , strong and purposeful . The shore line loomed ever nearer — the surf was white and foaming ; Shoogar steadily increased the pace of the chant . Even so , we kept sinking lower and lower toward the water - not as fast as before , but it was apparent that the airbags were no longer as tight as they had been . The water slipped past us , the windmakers dipping through the higher waves ; then cutting through the swells themselves , becoming visible only in the troughs between the waves ; and at last , no longer visible at all . The outriggers hung low along the sides of the boat , and pushed us through the surf . The balloons hung in silent stillness overhead , and the sea splashed below . An occasional spray of wet foam came through the rigging . Shoogar interrupted his chanting to call , “
130197	130284	130300	130300	We	2846	” I climbed forward . Ahead lay a bleak and forbidding landscape of jagged black and brown . It was streaked with gray and purple , and ominously stained whites . All was pitted and scarred . Here and there a flash of red testified to a scorchblossom 's attempt to take root , but little more was visible . Except — was that the fire - blackened shell of a wild housetree ? It looked like a gaunt hand frozen in an anguished skyward grasp . “
130317	130361	130300	130300	We	2846	” Purple came up behind me , a clicking device in his hands . I had noticed it on his belt before , but he had never explained its use . Now he tapped it experimentally and frowned . At last he smiled , "
130366	130374	130465	130465	Lant	71	" He used a demon word here , “
130411	130464	130465	130465	Lant	71	” The boat was splashing through the waves now , and Purple directed the boys to head for a place where the ground sloped gently into the water . We could see one not too far ahead , and the boys shifted direction to make for it . Purple peered ahead . ' “
130476	130481	130491	130491	Purple	108	” THE FLYING SORCERERS 291 “
130493	130521	130527	130527	Tooth	245	” I pointed . A few cracked , half - melted slabs of rock marked a conspicuous gap in the mountains to the north . He misunderstood . “
130529	130530	130548	130548	Critic	139	” “

130624	130641	130614	130614	he	2860	” . Purple was looking at his ticking thing again , waving it and pointing it . “
130646	130677	130688	130689	The Cathawk	226	” We bounced through the surf . There was a gentle bump as the nose of the boat slid up onto the sand . We had reached the northern shore . “
130683	130687	130688	130689	The Cathawk	226	” shouted Wilville . “
130693	130954	130979	130979	I	0	” As one person we jumped for shore , Shoogar and Purple and I scrambling over each other . At last we stood on solid ground again . The land was deso late , mostly naked rock , blood - colored in the westering light of Ouells and the overhead glow of Virn , but it was solid . No more standing in air , no more standing in water . No more standing in both at the same time . If ever I returned safely home , I swore , I would never again risk my life in so foolhardy a venture . The skies were not friendly Wilville , and Orbur had slung up the airpushers and pulled the Cathawk high on the shore , out of reach of the lapping waves . Immediately they began filling the ballast bags , and the interior of the boat as well , with a low level of water . 292 THE FLYING SORCERERS They began checking the rigging , the bicycle frames , and even the watertightness of the boatframe and the balloons . They acted as if they expected the Cathawk to fly again . How , I could not imagine . The gasbags were all limp from leakage , and I did not trust the seams on several of them . They still extended upward from their ropes , but none were very determined about it . How they hoped to refill the windbags , I did not know . Shoogar was walking around and chuckling to himself . "
130984	131071	131082	131082	I	0	" and he wandered off toward a distant blackened hill , carrying his spell kit . A strange black crust covered everything . It shattered when one stepped on it and left miniscule shards , or stinging dust which went up in wisps before the surly wind . Curious , I crunched across the ground toward the hill where Purple stood . He was attaching his big battery to another of his endless spell devices . He looked both sheepish and defiant as I came up . “

131115	131141	131096	131096	I	0	” And he finished attaching the wires to the disc - shaped thing from his belt . He twisted a knob , but nothing happened . “
131154	131180	131096	131096	I	0	” Purple explained , smiling foolishly . He twisted the knob again , harder this time , but the yellow light still did not appear . “
131187	131264	131096	131096	I	0	" he said . He sighed . I knew just how he felt then . I longed to be going home myself . How strangel — that I should consider an area that I had lived in for only a short time as my home ; while this bleak map , the blasted remains of the village where I had spent most of my life , was no longer home but a strange and alien land . “
131266	131318	131333	131333	Shoogar	70	” was a new land and a different life across the sea . For that one terrible moment Purple and I were alike . THE FLYING SORCERERS 293 Two strangers , marooned on a bleak and blackened shore , each longing for his home , his wives , and his Quaff . "
131328	131332	131337	131337	You	2864	” said Purple . "
131343	131497	131730	131730	Purple	108	" He picked up his useless devices and trudged slowly down the hill . The ground crunched beneath his feet . people did hien the Were , the 100 me could There was nothing to eat . I lay there in the darkness and listened to the roar of the surf and the rumble of my stomach . Man was not meant to live without bread alone . I was dizzy with hunger . My thoughts did n't even make sense any more . Purple had spent the red day wandering dully up and down this landscape of despair . I and my sons waited . There was little else we could do . Shoogar was the only one with a sense of purpose . He had positioned himself patiently at the top of a nearby slope to wait for the moons . He chanted a song of triumph . Purple muttered incessantly . “
131639	131729	131730	131730	Purple	108	” He crunched through the dark , mumbling insanely . He would pick up rocks and examine them , then throw them down again and stumble on . I stared up into the dark at the twinkling moons . There would be no next time . I was sure of that . Shoogar was n't going to let there be a next time . From his hill there was only silence now . 294 THE FLYING SORCERERS I turned over on my blanket and raised up on my elbows . “
131732	131736	131745	131745	I	0	” I called , "

131775	131870	131873	131873	I	0	” I leapt to my feet , thinking Shoogar had struck in the dark . But no — Purple 's flashlight went on revealing that he had tripped over a boulder . He lay there in his impact suit , grinning foolishly . I walked over and helped him up . The night was stale and still ; the surf was a distant rumble . We stood in the dark , Purple 's light the only thing in existence , casting an eery white aura into the chaotic blackness . Purple switched it off . “
131880	131902	131873	131873	I	0	" he said — and stopped . There was deathly silence . Not even insects still lived in this accursed land . "
131907	131922	131933	131933	Lant	71	" Purple repeated quietly . His hands clamped on my shoulders and he screamed , “

131943	131953	131956	131956	Lant	71	" He was as strong as an old ram . "

131996	132057	131990	131990	you	71	” There was a scraping sound in the dark as he removed the flashlight 's small battery , another sound as he pulled the calling device from his belt , an incomprehensible curse as he tried to attach the wires in the dark . He worked eagerly , impatiently - I could not blame him . At last he said , “
132062	132099	132111	132111	I	0	" There was a click as he switched on the device . A dial on its face gave off a soft glow . Before he even pressed the call button , he peered at this dial . “

The only one who 's going to get any benefit out of this will be Shoogar . "

138888	138891	138892	138892	he	108	" Shoogar , "
138900	138953	138977	138977	He	70	“ I have nothing to give you . You are too great a magician for me to insult you . I can not offer you anything at all that you do not already have , and for me to presume that I can would be an affront to your skill and greatness . "
138971	138976	138999	138999	Purple	108	“ No gift — ? "

139106	139121	139161	139161	He	70	“ You admit it - you admit that I am a greater magician — ? "
139122	139160	139181	139181	he	70	“ Shoogar , I admit it . You know more about the magic and the Gods of this world than anyone — including me . You are the greatest — and you have your flying machine now . "
139174	139180	139181	139181	he	70	“ I will miss you , ”
139184	139198	139419	139419	Wilville	79	“ All of you . Even you , Shoogar . And your duels . "
139409	139417	139436	139436	Orbur	78	“ I knew we had forgotten something , "
139431	139434	139436	139436	Orbur	78	“ North , ”

Each time the best we had done was to maintain our position over the shore - and each time , as the boys had slackened , the wind had threatened to push us inland .

139730	139786	139668	139668	We	2984	” We were miles east of where we had first touched shore . It was a spot that had once been below our old village . It was as desolate as the other . I chewed thoughtfully on one of Purple 's food sticks — it was soft and brown and had an odd taste . “
139793	139797	139668	139668	We	2984	” I said . “

139863	139869	139898	139899	The airpushers	2084	” Wilville was shouting now . "
139925	139926	139898	139899	The airpushers	2084	" “
139929	139933	139898	139899	The airpushers	2084	” I said , “
139959	139960	140004	140006	THE FLYING SORCERERS	79	” “
140026	141327	141381	141381	you	2992	” Wilville and Orbur were right , of course . They usually were in matters concerning the flying machine . It was almost as if they knew as much about it as Purple - certainly more so than Shoogar . Shoogar had protested their whole discussion equating the action of the wind on the balloons with the action of wind on sails . But , said Orbur , wind is wind . And Wilville and Orbur were right . The water splashed slowly under us , the airmakers churned it into froth behind us . The boys had to pedal nearly twice as hard as they would have in the air . The sea was sinking again , and rapids and whirlpools were frequent . Often , we had to take to the air . When we did this , we would usually slip backwards , but then the boys would begin driving either east or west , and in this manner we managed to avoid most of the dangers of our first journey . Whenever the boys tired of pedaling , we either took on ballast or released some gas . In the water , our backward slippage was slight . We trailed fishing lines behind us . They had been a gift from Purple and not understood at first , but once they had been explained we were eager to put them to use . Once we caught something big and it pulled us eastward for half a day before we could cut through the line . We had to use a special tool to do that . It was not that the food Purple had given us was inadequate . It was just that it tasted bad . We ate it only when there was nothing else available . On the fifth day we were lucky enough to slip into a section of water that was receding rapidly southward . We stayed with it as long as we could until it became too savage . Then we lifted into the air . The boys were delighted to find that the wind was behind us now . The darknesses were longer now - nearly two hours — and the seasons were changing . The oceans were slipping away again . They would continue to slip for months , but the process had begun . The sea below churned over razor - sharp reefs that were becoming mountain peaks . There was a period when we saw nothing but fog : blue fog , white fog , red fog , black fog , blue THE FLYING SORCERERS 313 fog , and so on , endlessly repeated with the cycle of the suns . We had lost three of our aircloth windbags by now . Their seams had given way abruptly , one right after the other , smacking the boat solidly into the water . We made up the difference by inflating Purple 's weather windbag even more . It was only half full , but more than offset the loss of the others . We lost two more bags in as many days . Apparently there was something seriously wrong with the glue Grimm had used to seal the seams — and perhaps his stitching was n't as strong as it should have been . The bags that we still had held their air for little more than a day . Shoogar and I were constantly recharging them . The aircloth had been tight when we had woven it , but it was certainly no longer so . Something tended to weaken it with continual use . We still trailed our fishing lines below us , they hung like slender threads of shimmering gossamer . I wondered how they were made , and if we could duplicate them . We sailed into another wall of fog . Blue fog , white fog , red fogIn black fog we hooked something big , too big to draw in . We dared not cut the line . It was too precious to lose . The wind whistled past us — how fast were we moving ? And then the fog cleared as the blue sun burnt it off , and we saw that we had hooked land . The desert we had crossed so many months ago which had been sea bottom for the last few seasons - was a swamp now ; a marsh of riotous colors , blooming briefly and frenetically during the few short hands of days it would take it to dry . There were roots to chew down there — and possibly meat . We reeled in the line and pulled ourselves down . We were within walking distance of home . We returned to the peaceful life of the twin villages . Indeed , life turned out to be even more peaceful than we 314 THE FLYING SORCERERS remembered it . And Shoogar and I were responsible . On the Cathawk 's departure we had dropped the dust of yearning across the cheering crowd . The resultant orgy lasted for three weeks . Most improper , of course , but it left a feeling of fellowship between the Upper and Lower Village . Another bond between us is Shoogar himself . He is now resident magician of both tribes . Before Gortik would let him assume that post though , he secured from Shoogar an oath to redeem and honor all spell chips in the village at their full value . Shoogar had needed some persuading before he would redeem Purple 's chips , but Purple 's parting words left him in what could only be called a good humor . Once , he was even seen smiling . There were one or two who were upset about the arrangement , of course . Hinc , who had invested heavily in Purple chips , felt that they should be redeemed at their old value of ten for one . Hinc has been scratching for the past three hands of days . But life is peaceful here . In the evenings I sit and listen to the wives quarreling and the children crying and think how good it is to be home . Life has returned to its gentle pace . I carve the bone into chips , and regulate the flow of commerce as I have always done . Others work out the new processes and make the goods and I distribute the chips , blue ones only since Purple has gone . Weaving is still our major industry here . Traders come not only from the other villages on the island , but from the mainland as well - even from as far south as the Land of Frozen Water . Every five days a new party arrives , always from further and further away . We are a powerful trading village now , gaining power as the fame of our cloth is spreading . Wilville and Orbur are at work on a new Cathawk . The old one sits in a place of honor in a special clearing owned by the son of Trone the Smith . It is Smith 's Son 's Clearing , and no trader ever comes without stopping to peer curiously at the boat out of water . The new Cathawk will be huge nearly fifteen manlengths -it will require over one hundred windbags and ten men on bicycles to propel it ; but the next wading season will not THE FLYING SORCERERS 315 interrupt our trade with the mainland . The boatmaking and weaving apprentices have never worked so hard in their lives . At first , when Wilville and Orbur announced their plans , there was some dissent—“What
141375	141377	141381	141381	you	2992	” . “
141388	141393	141849	141849	you	2998	" was the answer . "
141447	141827	141849	141849	you	2998	" Those who could not see the value of it were soon shouted down . Gortik and I gave my sons the go - ahead , and up on the crag the new cradle rises impressively . It seems likely that the women will have names forever . Shoogar had thought that after the airboat was finished we could deconsecrate even the Missa names — but as long as we need them for spinning , we dare not do that . And the plague spreads . The new wife , whom I bought on the mainland , had not been in my home but two days before she too asked for a name . My other wives support her . Somehow they have gotten the idea that all women must have names — even if they are only Missas . The only exception is my hairless daughter . Shoogar is planning to consecrate her soon . She will have a secret name of her own . Shoogar is frantically busy these days . He can deconsecrate , bleed and reconsecrate a housetree in almost no time at all . And it costs the nest owner only a spell token . It was lucky that Shoogar discovered that housetree bleeding is a good way to ward off the demons . He resells the housetree blood to the clothmakers for less than one chip per tree load — which is eminently fair of him . Because of Shoogar 's increased status I have had to take on extra apprentices . I have more than ten now , and they carve more chips in a day than can possibly be redeemed by any one magician . Many of the villagers no longer seem to regard the redemption of the spells as necessary . They trade the chips like lightweight , valuable , indestructible goods . 316 THE FLYING SORCERERS But others still value the chips well enough to keep Shoogar constantly busy . There is cloth to be blessed , looms to be consecrated , housetrees to be unblessed , bled and blessed again , fertility spells and name givings — and always he must watch out for his apprentices who are getting better and better in their attempts to kill him . “
