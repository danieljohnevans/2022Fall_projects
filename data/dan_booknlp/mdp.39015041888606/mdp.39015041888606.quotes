2058	2076	1995	1995	she	496	" Yes , of course . Tests of various kinds , as you know . Various indexes . "
2077	2089	1995	1995	she	496	" But your own personal judgments must count too , right ? "
2090	2096	2019	2019	They	897	" Yes . Of course . "
2100	2121	1995	1995	she	496	" But it must be hard to separate out your personal feelings about people from your professional judgments , yes ? "
2122	2126	1995	1995	she	496	" I suppose . "
2127	2134	1995	1995	she	496	" How do you do it ? "
2135	2174	1995	1995	she	496	" Well ... I suppose you would say it is a habit of mind . I like people , or whatever , for different reasons to the reasons that might make someone good on a project like this . "
2175	2184	1995	1995	she	496	" For what reasons do you like people ? "
2185	2232	2233	2233	She	899	" Well , I try not to be too analytical about that ! You know — it 's a danger in my job , becoming too analytical . I try to let my own feelings alone , as long as they are n't bothering me somehow . "
2236	2275	2233	2233	She	899	" Very sensible , I 'm sure . I do n't know if I could manage that . I should try . It 's all the same to me . That 's not always good . Not appropriate . "
2969	2972	2973	2973	she	498	" Anyway , "
2977	3012	2973	2973	she	498	" scientists can use the pond as a singlesetting minimum - temperature thermometer . Come here in the spring and you know immediately if the previous winter has gotten below minus fifty - four . "
3214	3236	3206	3206	she	498	" My God ! Come taste , Michel , but just a touch , I warn you . It 's terrible ! "
3264	3277	3239	3239	he	934	" It 's fifty times saltier than the sea , taste it . "
3326	3330	3331	3331	he	489	" My God , "
3338	3343	3331	3331	he	489	" Is it poison ? "
3354	3358	3359	3359	She	498	" No no . "
3362	3394	3359	3359	She	498	" Salts only . A hundred twenty - six grams of salt per liter of water . As opposed to three point seven grams per liter , in seawater . Incredible . "
3431	3439	3440	3440	he	489	" Salt raised to a higher power , "
3899	3927	3881	3881	He	497	" Check those glaciers , falling out of the passes and being blown away before they reach the valley floor . What an awesome place , really . "
3928	3931	3881	3881	He	497	" Yes . "
3932	3969	3881	3881	He	497	" These katabatic winds — falling off the polar cap — nothing can stop them . Cold as hell . I wonder if that little wind vane we set up here will even be there anymore . "

4017	4032	4177	4177	he	960	" What 's this , we 're still at work out here are we ? "
4033	4042	4177	4177	he	960	" No no . I 'm just curious . "
4043	4175	4177	4177	he	960	" Sure . Well , I want to try it . I want to try living somewhere where you can actually try to do something new . Set up new systems , you know . I grew up in the South , like you did . Only the American South is a lot different than the French south . We were stuck in our history for a long , long time . Then things opened up , partly because it got so bad . Partly just a lot of hurricanes hitting the coast ! And we had a chance to rebuild . And we did , but — not much changed . Not enough , Michel . So I have this desire to try it again . That 's the truth . "
4728	4732	4733	4733	Maya	496	" Excuse me , "
4753	4759	4749	4749	Michel	489	" Is it your hip ? "

4788	4863	4780	4780	she	496	" Here , let 's get your harness undipped from the sled . Okay , slip the sled under him . Move him gently ! Okay . Hold still there , we 'll get you back to the station . Can you stay steady or should we strap you down . Okay , let 's go . Help stabilize the sled . Someone radio the station and tell them to get ready for us . "
4982	4990	4991	4991	Michel	489	" He went down in a flash , "
4997	5018	4991	4991	Michel	489	" So fast he had no time to get a hand up . I 'm not surprised it broke something . "

9555	9689	9549	9549	they	1175	" It 's a pure situation , you have to remember that . There might even be indigenous life , left there underground from the early warm wet period . So that we have to make a sterile landing and a sterile colony . Put a cordon sanitaire between us and Mars proper . Then a comprehensive search . IfTerran life was allowed to invade the ground before we determined the presence or absence of life , it would be a disaster for science . And the contamination might work the other way too . You ca n't be too careful . No — if anyone tries to infect Mars , there will be opposition . Maybe even active resistance . Poison the poisoners . You can never tell what people will do . "
10042	10048	10032	10032	Maya	496	" What — running away ? "
10049	10079	10080	10080	Her	496	" No no — no — I'm going to have a look at the Scott and Shackleton huts . A matter of research . I 'll be right back . "

12675	12783	12672	12672	Michel	489	" Social life is a set of contradictory demands . That 's normal , agreed . But what we 're talking about here are requirements to be two opposite things at once . Classic double binds . And they are already causing a lot of the classic responses . Hidden lives . Multiple personalities . Bad faith . Repression , then the return of the repressed . A close look at the results of the tests given down there will show it is not a viable project . I would advise starting with small scientific stations , with rotating crews . As Antarctica itself is operated now . "
12863	12868	12869	12869	he	514	" Look , Michel , "
12872	12956	12869	12869	he	514	" They want to go . They 're capable of adapting . A lot of them did very well with that , so well that you could n't pick them out of a crowd in any kind of blind test . And they want to go , it 's clear . That 's how we should choose who to send . We should give them their chance to do what they want . It 's not really our business to decide for them . "
12957	12968	12861	12861	Professional	1321	" But it wo n't work . We saw that . "
12969	13046	13047	13047	He	1322	" I did n't see that . They did n't see that . What you saw is your concern , but they have the right to make their try at it . Anything could happen there , Michel . Anything . And this world is not so well Michel in Antarctica 25 arranged that we should deny people who want to take their chance to try something different . It could be good for us all . "
13055	13060	13047	13047	He	1322	" Think about it . "
13651	13674	13675	13675	John	555	" Roger , why do n't we just pull it down the road we 've got here and camp around the corner ? "

16451	16478	16479	16479	Roger	550	" You 'd better get assigned there in a hurry , had n't you — I hear it takes a whole lifetime to learn those canyons . "
16486	16493	16479	16479	Roger	550	" Oh not for our Roger , "
16503	16510	16511	16511	Roger	550	" No one ever learns Marineris , "
16514	16528	16511	16511	Roger	550	" It 's eight thousand kilometers long , with hundreds of side canyons — "
16529	16534	16535	16535	Eileen	551	" What about Gustafsen ? "
16538	16552	16535	16535	Eileen	551	" I thought he and a couple others knew every inch of it . "
16553	16556	16511	16511	Roger	550	" Well ... "
16557	16565	16511	16511	Roger	550	" Better start working on that transfer . "

16681	16689	16690	16690	Ivan	557	" Yes , it will be exquisite , "

16747	16753	16754	16754	Ivan	557	" You do n't agree ? "
16762	16802	16757	16757	Roger	550	" The best you can do is make an imitation Earth . That 's not what Mars is for . Since we 're on Mars , we should adjust to what it is , and enjoy it for that . "
16803	16815	16816	16816	John	555	" Oh but there will always be natural canyons and mountains , "
16819	16834	16816	16816	John	555	" There 's as much land surface on Mars as on Earth , right ? "
16835	16839	16757	16757	Roger	550	" Just barely . "
16840	16871	16816	16816	John	555	" So with all that land , it will take centuries for it all to be terraformed . In this gravity , maybe never . But centuries , at least . "
16876	16888	16889	16889	Roger	550	" Yes , but that 's the direction it 's headed , "
16892	16913	16889	16889	Roger	550	" If they start orbiting mirrors and blowing open volcanoes to provide gases , they 'll change the whole surface . "
16914	16922	16923	16923	Ivan	557	" But would n't that be marvelous ! "
16926	16944	16923	16923	Ivan	557	" You do n't seriously object to making life on the open surface possible , do you ? "
16952	16961	16962	16962	John	555	" I like it the way it is . "
17128	17134	17135	17135	he	1465	" Hike'll be over soon , "
17526	17529	17530	17530	he	567	" Oh ? "

17756	17763	17751	17751	they	1477	" Look out for that rock . "
17764	17773	17751	17751	they	1477	" How nice , that triangle of shards . "
17812	17823	17809	17809	she	551	" What if we let the wagon slip right now ? "
17846	17851	17852	17852	his	550	" It would fall , "
17876	17895	17870	17870	She	551	" Come on , would it break ? Are we in danger of our lives most every minute ? "
17896	17945	17870	17870	She	551	" No way . These things are practically indestructible . Otherwise , it would be too dangerous to use them . They 've dropped them off four - hundred - meter cliffs — not sheer you understand , but steep — and it does n't even dent them . "
17946	17971	17870	17870	She	551	" I see . So when you saved the wagon from slipping down that slope yesterday , you were n't actually saving our lives . "
17972	17995	17870	17870	She	551	" Oh no . Did you think that ? I just did n't want to climb down that hill and recover it . "
18000	18003	18004	18004	She	551	" Ah . "
18091	18094	18095	18095	Eileen	551	" What ? "

18164	18170	18171	18171	he	550	" No good campsites around , "
18187	18195	18178	18178	he	550	" See that feathering in the sky ? "
18218	18221	18215	18215	she	551	" Yes ? "
18222	18239	18215	18215	she	551	" Dust storm . Coming our way too . I think I feel the wind already . "
18307	18313	18314	18314	Roger	550	" Any campsites down there ? "
18317	18326	18314	18314	Roger	550	" No , the canyon gets even narrower . "
18405	18438	18401	18401	Roger	550	" You all down the canyon there , stick together and come on up to us . Doran , Cheryl , John , let 's hear from you — where are you ? "

18454	18463	18445	18445	Cheryl	553	" Yes , Cheryl , where are you ? "
18471	18487	18445	18445	Cheryl	553	" We 're in a sandstorm , Roger ! I can just barely hear you . "
18488	18496	18401	18401	Roger	550	" Are you with Doran and John ? "
18497	18525	18401	18401	Roger	550	" I 'm with Doran , and he 's just over this ridge , I can hear him , but he says he ca n't hear you . "
18529	18546	18401	18401	Roger	550	" Get together with him and start back for the main canyon . What about John ? "
18547	18563	18445	18445	Cheryl	553	" I do n't know , I have n't seen him in over an hour . "
18564	18572	18401	18401	Roger	550	" All right . Stay with Doran — "
18573	18576	18401	18401	Roger	550	" Roger ? "
18577	18580	18445	18445	Cheryl	553	" Yes ? "
18581	18587	18401	18401	Roger	550	" Doran 's here now . "

18608	18618	18601	18601	He	559	" Over that ridge there was too much interference . "
18619	18632	18633	18633	Roger	550	" Yeah , that 's what 's happening with John I expect , "

18726	18756	18757	18757	Eileen	551	" Well , we 've gone up the canyon we descended , but we must have taken a different fork , because we 've run into a box canyon . "
18810	18843	18808	18808	John	555	" Well , drop back to the last fork and try the next one to the south . As I recall , you 're over in the next canyon north of us . "
18844	18847	18848	18848	Doran	559	" Right , "
18851	18857	18848	18848	Doran	559	" We 'll try that . "

18916	18925	18911	18911	He	550	" Help me pull this up the slope . "
18926	18929	18930	18931	Dr. Mitsumu	552	" Why ? "
18934	18952	18930	18931	Dr. Mitsumu	552	" We 're setting the tent up there . Sleep on an angle tonight , you bet . "
18953	18959	18960	18961	Dr. Mitsumu	552	" But why up there ? "
18964	18977	18960	18961	Dr. Mitsumu	552	" Could n't we set up the tent here in the wash ? "
18978	18986	18987	18987	Roger	550	" It 's the old arroyo problem , "
18991	19017	18987	18987	Roger	550	" If the storm keeps up the canyon could start spilling sand as if it were water . We do n't want to be buried . "
19060	19074	19042	19042	Roger	550	" Okay , you four get inside and get everything going . Eileen — "
19075	19078	19081	19081	Doran	559	" Roger ? "
19083	19086	19081	19081	Doran	559	" Yes . "
19087	19098	19042	19042	Roger	550	" We 're still having trouble finding the main canyon . "
19099	19107	19108	19108	Cheryl	553	" We thought we were in it , "
19111	19125	19108	19108	Cheryl	553	" but when we descended we came to a big drop - off ! "
19126	19182	19042	19042	Roger	550	" Okay . Hold on a minute where you are . Eileen , I want you to come up the main canyon with me and serve as a radio relay . You 'll stay in the wash , so you 'll be able to walk right back down to the tent if we get separated . "
19183	19186	19187	19187	Eileen	551	" Sure , "
19246	19254	19259	19259	he	1343	" I hate it when this happens . "
19267	19273	19274	19274	Eileen	551	" I bet you do ! "
19277	19286	19274	19274	Eileen	551	" How are we going to find John ? "
19287	19309	19236	19237	the guide	1343	" Go high . Always go high when lost . I believe I told John that with the rest of you . "
19310	19313	19314	19314	Eileen	551	" Yes . "
19328	19335	19336	19336	Roger	550	" Even if he 's forgotten , "
19339	19393	19394	19394	he	550	" when we get high enough , the radios will be less obstructed and we 'll be able to talk to him . Or at the worst , we can bounce our signals off a satellite and back down . But I doubt we 'll have to do that . Hey , Doran ! "
19401	19404	19394	19394	he	550	" Yeah ? "
19410	19417	19405	19405	Doran	559	" What can you see now ? "
19418	19439	19394	19394	he	550	" Um — we're on a spine — it 's all we can see . The canyon to the right — "
19440	19443	19394	19394	he	550	" South ? "
19444	19487	19405	19405	Doran	559	" Yeah , the south , is the one we were in . We thought the one here to the north would be the main one , but it 's too little , and there 's a drop - off in it . "
19488	19521	19394	19394	he	550	" Okay , well , my APS has you still north of us , so cross back to the opposite spine and we 'll talk from there . Can you do that ? "
19522	19525	19526	19526	Doran	559	" Sure , "
19531	19540	19526	19526	Doran	559	" It 'll take a while , maybe . "
19544	19554	19560	19560	Roger	550	" That 's all right , take your time . "
19601	19608	19609	19609	Roger	550	" Let 's keep moving up , "
19615	19628	19609	19609	Roger	550	" I do n't think we have to worry about those two . "
19687	19696	19697	19697	Roger	550	" How are you doing back in camp ? "
19704	19708	19697	19697	Roger	550	" Just fine , "
19713	19739	19709	19710	Dr. Mitsumu	552	" It 's on too much of a tilt to stand , so we 're just sitting around and listening to the developments up there . "
19740	19746	19697	19697	Roger	550	" Still in your suits ? "
19747	19750	19697	19697	Roger	550	" Yes . "
19751	19762	19709	19710	Dr. Mitsumu	552	" Good . One of you stay suited for sure . "
19763	19768	19769	19769	Roger	550	" Whatever you say . "
19788	19804	19805	19805	he	550	" Watch out , I 'm going to turn up the gain on the radio , "
19820	19845	19812	19812	She	551	" JOHN ! Hey , John ! Oh , Jo - uhnnn ! Come in , John ! Respond on common band . Please . "
19865	19868	19869	19869	Roger	550	" Hmm , "
19877	19881	19869	19869	Roger	550	" Hey Roger ! "
19882	19890	19869	19869	Roger	550	" Cheryl ! How are you doing ? "
19891	19907	19908	19908	Doran	559	" Well , we 're in what we think is the main canyon , but ... "
19913	19928	19908	19908	Doran	559	" We really ca n't be sure , now . Everything looks the same . "
19929	19935	19936	19936	Roger	550	" You 're telling me , "
19961	19978	19952	19952	He	550	" Try going to the wash at the lowest point in the canyon you 're in . "
19979	19984	19908	19908	Doran	559	" We 're there . "
19985	20031	19952	19952	He	550	" Okay , lean down and see if you find any boot prints . Make sure Exploring Fossil Canyon 39 they are n't yours . They 'll be faint by now , but Eileen and I just went upcanyon , so there should still be — "
20032	20039	20040	20040	Cheryl	553	" Hey ! Here 's some , "
20043	20046	20048	20048	Doran	559	" Where ? "
20050	20056	20048	20048	Doran	559	" Over here , look . "
20060	20074	19952	19952	He	550	" Yeah , Roger , we 've found some going upcanyon and down . "
20075	20092	19952	19952	He	550	" Good . Now start downcanyon . Dr. M , are you still in your suit ? "
20093	20101	19952	19952	He	550	" Just as you said , Roger . "
20102	20152	19952	19952	He	550	" Good . Why do n't you get out of the tent and go down to the wash . Keep your bearing , count your steps and all . Wait for Cheryl and Doran . That way they 'll be able to find the tent as they come down . "
20153	20157	19952	19952	He	550	" Sounds good . "
20162	20188	19952	19952	He	550	" You all down there switch to band 5 to talk on , and just listen to common . We need to hear up here . "
20194	20218	19952	19952	He	550	" Let 's go up some more . I believe I remember a gendarme on the ridge up here with a good vantage . "
20219	20230	19952	19952	He	550	" Fine . Where do you think he could be ? "
20231	20236	19952	19952	He	550	" You got me . "
20398	20406	20407	20407	Roger	550	" I suppose we should go higher . "
20410	20435	20407	20407	Roger	550	" Although I thought I saw him back when we brought the wagon down here , and I doubt he 'd go back up . "
20442	20447	20437	20437	Eileen	551	" Pss ftunk bdzz , "
20454	20463	20437	20437	Eileen	551	" Ckk ssss ger , lo ! ckk . "
20464	20474	20475	20475	Roger	550	" Sounds like he may have indeed gone high , "
20491	20503	20475	20475	Roger	550	" Hey , John ! Nobleton ! Do you read us ? "
20507	20518	20505	20506	THE MARTIANS	511	" Ckk sssssssss yeah , hey ! sssss kuh sssss . "
20519	20537	20437	20437	Eileen	551	" We read you badly , John ! Keep moving , keep talking ! Are you all — "
20538	20547	20475	20475	Roger	550	" Roger ! ckk . Hey , Roger ! "
20548	20560	20505	20506	THE MARTIANS	511	" John ! We read you , are you all right ? "
20561	20571	20437	20437	Eileen	551	" ... sssss not exactly sure where I am . "
20572	20578	20437	20437	Eileen	551	" Are you all right ? "
20579	20585	20475	20475	Roger	550	" Yes ! Just lost . "
20586	20600	20437	20437	Eileen	551	" Well not anymore , we hope . Tell us what you see . "
20601	20604	20437	20437	Eileen	551	" Nothing ! "
20646	20653	20654	20654	John	555	" You wo n't believe it . "
20670	20703	20666	20666	he	1528	" You wo n't believe it , Eileen , Roger , crk ! Just before the storm hit I was way off down a tributary to the south , and I found ... "
20704	20708	20666	20666	he	1528	" Found what ? "
20709	20734	20666	20666	he	1528	" Well ... I 've found some things I 'm sure must be fossils . I swear ! A whole rock formation of them ! "
20735	20739	20666	20666	he	1528	" Oh yeah ? "
20740	20855	20666	20666	he	1528	" No seriously , I 've got some with me . Very small shells , like little sea snails , or Crustacea . Miniature nautiloids , like . They just could n't be anything else . I have a couple in my pocket , but there 's a whole wall of them back there ! I figure if I just left I would n't be able to find the same canyon ever again , what with this storm , so I built a duck trail on the way back over to the main canyon , if that 's where I am . So it took me a while to get back in radio clear . "
20856	20862	20863	20863	Ivan	557	" What color are they ? "
20868	20876	20877	20877	Roger	550	" You down there , be quiet , "
20880	20889	20877	20877	Roger	550	" We 're still trying to find him . "
20890	20916	20666	20666	he	1528	" We 'll be able to get back to the site . Eileen , can you believe it ? We 'll all be — Hey ! "
20917	20923	20924	20924	Roger	550	" It 's just me , "
20927	20938	20924	20924	Roger	550	" Ah ! You gave me a start , there . "
21269	21279	21280	21280	John	555	" So we 'll go there tomorrow , right ? "
21300	21311	21312	21312	Roger	550	" Or as soon as the storm ends , sure . "
21326	21341	21321	21321	his	550	" I do n't know , do n't get your hopes up too high . "
21347	21361	21342	21342	Eileen	551	" We 'll follow that duck trail of yours , if we can . "
21626	21636	21637	21637	Roger	550	" There 's the gendarme where we found you , "
21665	21672	21673	21673	he	953	" There 's the first duck , "
21677	21704	21673	21673	he	953	" I see it way over there , but with all the sand , it looks almost like any other mound . This could be hard . "
21705	21711	21712	21712	Roger	550	" We 'll find them , "
21837	21842	21833	21833	someone	4880	" Here it is , "
21935	21945	21946	21946	Roger	550	" Well , but there 's the next duck , "
21971	21993	21968	21968	John	555	" This is it ! Right down this ravine , in the wall itself . And some of them have fallen . "
22131	22141	22142	22142	John	555	" See Exploring Fossil Canyon 43 what I mean ? "
22146	22190	22142	22142	John	555	" Martian snails ! It 's like those fossil bacterial mats they talk about , only further advanced . Back when Mars had surface water and an atmosphere , life did begin . It just did n't have time to get very far . "
22191	22195	22196	22196	Cheryl	553	" Nobleton snails , "
22274	22285	22268	22268	Roger	550	" Uh - ohh .... Hey , people . Hey . "
22294	22311	22290	22290	he	550	" I hate to spoil the party , but ... these little things are n't fossils . "
22312	22315	22268	22268	Roger	550	" What ? "
22316	22322	22323	22323	John	555	" What do you mean ? "
22328	22334	22290	22290	he	550	" How do you know ? "
22335	22344	22345	22345	Roger	550	" Well , there are a couple reasons , "
22357	22384	22348	22348	Everyone	824	" First , I believe that fossils are created by a process that requires millions of years of water seepage , and Mars never had that . "
22385	22391	22392	22392	Ivan	557	" So we think now , "
22395	22425	22392	22392	Ivan	557	" But it may not be so , because it 's certain that there was water on Mars all along . And after all , here are these things . "
22426	22429	22433	22433	he	550	" Well ... "
22442	22501	22433	22433	he	550	" Maybe you 're right , but a better reason is , I think I know what these are . They 're lava pellets — bubble pellets , I 've heard them called — although I 've never seen ones this small . Little lava bombs from one of the Olympus Mons eruptions . A sort of spray . "
22511	22603	22502	22502	Everyone	824	" See , when lava pellets land hot in a certain sort of sand , they sink right through it and melt the sand fast , releasing gas that forms the bubble , and these glassy interiors . When the pellet is spinning , you get these spiral chambers . So I 've heard , anyway . It must have happened on a flat plain long ago , and when the whole plain tilted and started falling down this slope , these layers broke up and were buried by later deposits . "
22604	22614	22615	22615	John	555	" I do n't believe that 's necessarily so , "
22635	22649	22650	22650	Roger	550	" Of course we 'll have to take some back to be sure , "
22660	22671	22672	22672	Eileen	551	" Why did n't you tell us this last night ? "
22675	22724	22725	22725	He	550	" Well , I could n't tell till I had seen the rock they were in . But this is lava - sprayed sandstone , they call it . That 's why it 's so hard in its upper layers . But you 're an areologist , right ? "
22730	22742	22743	22743	Eileen	551	" Do n't they look like they 're made of lava ? "
22748	22753	22743	22743	Eileen	551	" Looks like it . "
22754	22763	22803	22804	both areologists	1577	" Well , lava does n't make fossils . "
22872	22883	22884	22884	Roger	550	" Once I thought I had found traces of aliens , "
22888	23054	22884	22884	Roger	550	" I was off by myself around the other side of Olympus , hiking canyons as usual , except I was by myself . I was crossing really broken fretted terrain , when suddenly I came across a trail duck . Stones never stack up by themselves . Now the Explorer 's Society keeps a record of every single hike and expedition , you know , and I had checked before and I knew I was in fresh territory , just like we are now . No humans had ever been in that part of the badlands , as far as the Society knew . Yet here was this duck . And I started finding other ones right away . Set not in a straight line , but zigzagging , tacking like . And little . Tiny piles of flat rock , four or five high . Like they were set up by little aliens who saw best out of the sides of their eyes . "
23055	23062	23063	23064	Mrs. Mitsumu	554	" You must have been astounded , "
23067	23171	23063	23064	Mrs. Mitsumu	554	" Exactly . But , you know — there were three possibilities . It was a natural rock formation — extremely unlikely , but it could be that breadloaf formations had slid onto their sides and then been eroded into separate pieces , still stacked on each other . Or they were set up by aliens . Also unlikely , in my opinion . Or someone had hiked through there without reporting it , and had played a game , maybe , for someone later to find . To me , that was the most likely explanation . But for a while there ... "
23172	23179	23181	23182	Mrs. Mitsumu	554	" You must have been disappointed , "
23184	23188	23189	23189	Roger	550	" Oh no , "
23193	23202	23189	23189	Roger	550	" More entertained than anything , I think . "
24062	24074	24079	24079	Bradbury	572	“ We have met the enemy , and he is us . "
24081	24097	24079	24079	Bradbury	572	“ The Martians were there ... Timothy and Robert and Michael and Mom and Dad . ”
24116	24124	24105	24105	Clayborne	550	“ But there was life on Mars . "
24318	24379	24381	24381	he	1626	" They still ca n't decide if there 's some ultrasmall nanobacteria down in the bedrock . The arguments go back and forth in the scientific journals all the time . Could be down there , so small we ca n't even see it . There 's been reports of drilling contamination . ... But I do n't think so . "
24958	24969	24951	24951	he	1645	" Your seismographs are probably picking us up right now . "
24986	24996	24970	24970	She	1641	" Yes , very nice ... the Earth moved . "
25008	25013	25000	25000	he	1645	" Several thousand kilometers . "
25122	25146	25110	25110	she	1641	" You really do n't think this wash would look better with some cactus and sage in it , say ? Or grasses ? "
25147	25165	25166	25166	He	550	" Nope . I like it the way it is . See that pentagon of shards there ? "
25169	25173	25166	25166	He	550	" How nice . "
25281	25287	25340	25340	She	1641	" Look at that rock . "
25288	25315	25340	25340	She	1641	" How nice that ridge is against the sky — it must be a hundred kilometers away , and it looks like you could touch it . "
25316	25322	25340	25340	She	1641	" Everything 's so red . "
25323	25339	25340	25340	She	1641	" Yeah . Red Mars , I love it . I 'm for red Mars . "
25432	25438	25439	25439	she	1641	" How old are you ? "
25442	25447	25439	25439	she	1641	" Twenty - six . "
25448	25452	25453	25453	He	1674	" My God ! "
25464	25467	25453	25453	He	1674	" What ? "
25468	25475	25439	25439	she	1641	" I thought you were older . "
25476	25479	25439	25439	she	1641	" No . "
25480	25489	25453	25453	He	1674	" How long have you been doing this ? "
25490	25494	25439	25439	she	1641	" Hiking canyons ? "
25495	25498	25439	25439	she	1641	" Yes . "
25499	25505	25453	25453	He	1674	" Since I was six . "
25506	25509	25439	25439	she	1641	" Oh . "
25550	25560	25561	25561	He	1674	" Can I come on another trip with you ? "
25573	25586	25561	25561	He	1674	" Oh yes . There are a lot of canyons to see . "

30173	30183	30157	30157	She	496	" Stop it ! J know you 're here . "
30294	30332	30291	30291	she	496	" What do you think I 'm going to do ? Do you think I 'm going to tell everyone about you ? Or send you home ? Do you think I 'm that kind of person ? "
30350	30353	30354	30354	he	953	" No , "
30362	30375	30354	30354	he	953	" I know you 're not . But I been so afraid . "
30376	30382	30383	30383	she	496	" Not necessary with me , "
30510	30517	30518	30518	she	496	" So who 's helping you ? "
30521	30524	30518	30518	she	496	" Hiroko ? "

30563	30567	30525	30525	His	953	" Your lover . "

30602	30625	30594	30594	he	953	" All of us wrapped around her little finger . And me living in a crawl space , for Christ 's sake . "
30626	30632	30640	30640	he	953	" To get to Mars . "
30633	30639	30640	30640	he	953	" To get to Mars , "
30644	30665	30640	30640	he	953	" To be with her , you mean . Crazy man that I am , damn fool idiot crazy man . "
30670	30676	30640	30640	he	953	" Where are you from ? "
30677	30688	30640	30640	he	953	" Tobago . Trinidad Tobago , do you know it ? "
30689	30697	30668	30668	Desmond	489	" Caribbean ? I visited Barbados once . "
30698	30704	30640	30640	he	953	" Like that , yeah . "
30705	30710	30640	30640	he	953	" But now Mars . "
30711	30714	30640	30640	he	953	" Someday . "
30715	30721	30722	30722	she	496	" We 're almost there , "
30725	30738	30722	30722	she	496	" I was afraid we would get there before I found you . "
30739	30742	30743	30743	he	489	" Hmph , "
30756	30770	30743	30743	he	489	" Well . Now I not in such a hurry to get there . "
30858	30876	30851	30851	he	489	" Hiroko , Phyllis , Arkady — they be trouble . Them and Frank , of course . "
30877	30883	30851	30851	he	489	" Tell me about it . "
30884	30893	30894	30894	he	489	" It 's quite a crew you have , "
30901	30904	30894	30894	he	489	" Yes . "
30918	30927	30915	30915	He	489	" You wo n't tell them about me ? "
30928	30931	30939	30939	him	489	" No . "
30932	30935	30939	30939	him	489	" Thanks . "
30946	30961	30939	30939	him	489	" I 'll help you , I swear . I 'll be your friend . "
30974	30981	30982	30982	she	496	" And I 'll be yours , "
30992	30999	30982	30982	she	496	" I 'll help you too . "
31000	31027	31028	31028	She	496	" We 'll help each other . There 'll be the hundred and all their jostle , and then you and me , helping each other . "
31035	31038	31028	31028	She	496	" Friends . "
31065	31073	31057	31057	He	1887	" Wait — what 's your name ? "
31074	31077	31057	31057	He	1887	" Desmond . "
31725	31851	31721	31721	he	1913	" Frank is thinking they may have to be investigated by some kind of formal , I do n't know , tribunal . Apparently material has gone missing , equipment , supplies , I do n't know . They ca n't account for their hours properly to him , and people back in Houston are beginning to ask questions . Frank says some down there are even talking about sending up a ship to evacuate anyone who has been actively stealing things . I do n't think that would do anyone any good , things are tenuous enough as it is . But Frank , well , you know Frank . He does n't like it when there are things going on outside his control . "
31852	31858	31859	31859	Maya	496	" Tell me about it , "
32139	32146	32135	32135	she	496	" Are they really taking things ? "
32147	32153	32117	32117	She	496	" Oh yeah , sure . "
32154	32158	32117	32117	She	496	" But why ? "
32159	32194	32117	32117	She	496	" Well , to have things that are their own . To be able to go out and explore different parts of Mars , and have things to keep their trips under the radar . "
32195	32201	32117	32117	She	496	" Are they doing that ? "
32202	32308	32309	32309	Maya	496	" Yeah . I 've been out myself . You know , they say it 's just a trip to 64 THE MARTIANS Hebes Chasma , and then they get over the horizon and set off to the east , mostly . Into the chaos . It 's beautiful , Maya , really beautiful . I mean maybe it 's just because I been cooped up so long , but I love being out there , I love it . It 's what I came for , here at last . In my life . I have a hard time convincing myself to come back . "
32319	32330	32309	32309	Maya	496	" Maybe that 's what you all ought to do . "
32331	32334	32117	32117	She	496	" What ? "
32335	32339	32309	32309	Maya	496	" Take off . "
32340	32346	32309	32309	Maya	496	" Where would I go ? "
32347	32393	32394	32394	She	496	" Not just you — all of you . Hiroko 's whole group . Take off and start your own colony . Go off where Frank and the rest of the police could n't find you . Otherwise you may get busted and sent home . "
32404	32407	32394	32394	She	496	" Hmm . "
32408	32428	32309	32309	Maya	496	" Could you do it , do you think ? Hide them all , like you 've hidden yourself ? "
32429	32453	32454	32454	He	1929	" Maybe . There 's some cave systems in the chaoses east of here , you would n't believe what I 've seen . "
32459	32508	32454	32454	He	1929	" We 'd need all the basics . And we 'd have to disguise our thermal signal . Send it down into the permafrost , melt our water for us . Yeah , I suppose it could be worked out . Hiroko has been thinking about it already . "
32509	32524	32571	32571	she	1930	" You should tell her to hurry up then . Before she gets busted . "
32525	32535	32454	32454	He	1929	" Okay , I will . Thanks , Maya . "
32716	32723	32713	32713	she	1930	" It 's been a while . "
32737	32745	32746	32746	he	1929	" Years since a time like that , "
32750	32760	32746	32746	he	1929	" Since I was about fifteen , I think . "
32769	32784	32761	32761	She	1930	" Flatterer . I take it your Hiroko does n't give you enough attention . "
32795	32806	32789	32789	He	1929	" We 'll see how it goes in the outback . "
32812	32820	32821	32821	she	1930	" I 'm going to miss you , "
32824	32837	32821	32821	she	1930	" Things wo n't be the same around here with you gone . "
32838	32845	32846	32846	he	1929	" I 'll miss you too , "
32855	32918	32846	32846	he	1929	" I love you , Maya . You 've been a friend to me , a good friend when I did n't have any . When I really needed one . I 'll never forget that . I 'll come back and visit you whenever I can . I 'm a very tenacious friend . You 'll find out it 's true . "
32919	32922	32923	32923	she	1930	" Good , "
33193	33195	33198	33198	i.e.	1952	" love "
33736	33739	33708	33708	He	1980	" Hi ! "
33748	33753	33740	33740	She	496	" What 's up ? "
33754	33765	33766	33766	They	1981	" I wanted to say hi , that 's all . "
33801	33810	33815	33815	His	1980	" Are you this Coyote they talk about ? "
33811	33814	33815	33815	His	1980	" Yes . "
33828	33846	33847	33847	Maya	496	" I thought so , I was sure of it ! So now you are a legend . "
33851	33871	33849	33849	Desmond	489	" No , I 'm Desmond . But Coyote is a damn good legend , yes . Very helpful . "
33918	33955	33971	33971	He	489	" The land is falling down so fast with this hydration , that a new boulder in a satellite photo is the most ordinary thing in the world . So I get around a lot now . "
33956	33960	33961	33961	He	489	" And Hiroko ? "
33964	33970	33971	33971	He	489	" I do n't know . "
33981	34025	33971	33971	He	489	" She 's Hiroko , that 's all . Making herself pregnant all the time , having kids . She 's crazy . But , you know . I like being with her . We still get along . I still love her . "
34026	34030	34078	34078	Oleg	593	" And her ? "
34031	34037	34038	34038	They	1988	" Oh she loves everything . "
34041	34046	34038	34038	They	1988	" What about you ? "
34047	34050	34051	34051	Maya	496	" Oh , "
34112	34117	34118	34118	he	489	" That sounds bad , "
34122	34133	34118	34118	he	489	" Yes . I do n't know what to do . "
34134	34153	34118	34118	he	489	" Sounds to me like you do know what to do , but you are n't doing it . "
34154	34157	34158	34158	she	496	" Well , "
34168	34171	34172	34172	he	489	" Look , "
34175	34202	34172	34172	he	489	" it 's love that matters . You have to go for love , whatever it takes . Pity is useless . A very corrosive thing . "
34203	34207	34118	34118	he	489	" False love . "
34208	34275	34172	34172	he	489	" No not false , but a kind of replacement for love . Or when it is . . . I mean , love and pity together , that 's compassion , I suppose . Something like Hiroko , and we need that . But pity without love , or instead of love , is a damn sorry thing . I been there and I know . "
34380	34387	34388	34388	she	496	" Drop by whenever you like , "
35242	35275	35237	35237	he	490	" You need more than this Maya , the big world is still out there . All of it waiting for you before it can make its next move , I judge . "
35276	35285	35237	35237	he	490	" It can wait a while longer then . "
35289	35300	35237	35237	he	490	" Why are n't you hooked up with a man . "
35301	35304	35237	35237	he	490	" Who ? "
35305	35313	35237	35237	he	490	" That 's for you to say . "
35314	35317	35318	35318	He	490	" Indeed . "
35538	35572	35518	35518	He	489	" There 's a man from Praxis here on planet I want to talk to . Nirgal thinks he 's the something or other , the messenger , but I do n't know . "
35573	35576	35577	35577	Maya	496	" Sure , "
35619	35630	35614	35614	Nadia	527	" Good , good , you need to get out , "
35636	35640	35641	35641	Maya	496	" Yes yes , "
35705	35712	35694	35694	She	496	" I 'm going with Coyote . "
35713	35723	35759	35759	He	489	" Not you too ! Will you come back ? "
35724	35729	35730	35730	He	489	" We 'll see . "
35736	35741	35730	35730	He	489	" Well , good . "
35742	35749	35759	35759	He	489	" You should get out too . "
35750	35758	35759	35759	He	489	" Yes ... perhaps now I will . "
35784	35792	35793	35793	he	489	" Do you think it 's time ? "
35796	35800	35793	35793	he	489	" Time for ? "
35801	35812	35774	35775	Michel Desmond	489	" For us ? For us to be out there ? "
35813	35816	35817	35817	she	496	" Yes , "
35919	35934	35916	35916	Desmond	489	" Look , he 's out in a field car , let 's follow . "
35988	35993	35980	35980	his	490	“ Welcome to Mars ! "
36034	36040	36041	36041	she	496	“ He 's a spy , "
36050	36056	36041	36041	she	496	“ He 's a messenger . "
36057	36064	36041	36041	she	496	" You do n't know that ! "
36065	36081	36041	36041	she	496	" Okay , okay . But be careful with him . Do n't be rude . "
36324	36328	36318	36318	she	496	“ My friend . "
36329	36332	36307	36307	she	496	“ Yes . "
36333	36340	36318	36318	she	496	" The one who understands me . "
36341	36344	36318	36318	she	496	“ Yes ? "
36642	36647	36648	36648	she	496	" I killed Phyllis , "
36703	36708	36709	36709	he	489	" You did good , "
36722	36727	36709	36709	he	489	" You saved Sax . "
37260	37263	37257	37257	lovers	2086	" in love "
37823	37836	37816	37816	she	496	" Desmond — were you in Nicosia the night John was killed ? "
37866	37872	37858	37858	He	489	" Yes . I was . "
37880	37885	37875	37875	his	489	" A bad night . "
37886	37890	37891	37891	she	496	" What happened ? "
37905	37909	37891	37891	she	496	" What happened ? "
37912	37924	37891	37891	she	496	" Did Frank do it , like they say he did ? "
37961	37970	37958	37958	he	489	" I do n't think Frank did it . "
37973	37993	37958	37958	he	489	" I saw him up in that triangular park , right around the time they must have attacked John . "
37994	38000	38001	38001	He	489	" But Selim and he ... "
38011	38119	38003	38003	his	489	" No one knows what went on between those two , Maya . That 's all just talk . No one can ever know what other people really said to each other . They make that stuff up . And it does n't matter what people say to each other either . Not compared to what they do . Even if Frank took this Arab and said , ' Kill John , I want you to do it , kill him kill him'—even if he said that , Maya and Desmond 75 which I doubt very much , because Frank was never that straightforward , you have to admit"—he
38128	38202	38003	38003	his	489	smile—"even so , if this Selim then went off and killed John , got his friends to help him , then it was still their doing , you know ? The people who do the deed are the ones responsible , if you ask me . All this stuff about following orders , or he made me do it or whatnot , all that is so much bullshit , it 's just excuses . "
38203	38212	38003	38003	his	489	" So if Hitler never killed anyone himself ... "
38213	38276	38003	38003	his	489	" Then he 's not as guilty as the guys in the camps , pulling the triggers and turning on the gas ! That 's right ! He was just a crazy old fuck . But they were murderers . And there were a lot more of them than there were of him . Sad when you think of it that way . "
38277	38280	38003	38003	his	489	" Yes . "
38290	38418	38419	38419	She	2102	" But look , Nicosia was complicated . A lot of people were fighting that night . Arab factions were fighting each other , Arabs were fighting Swiss , construction crews were fighting other crews . People say , ' Oh that Frank Chalmers started it all , started the riots as a cover for his arranging the murder of John Boone'—give me a break ! They just want to make it simple , they want a simple story , do you understand ? They pin blame on a single person because then it makes a simple story . And they can only handle simple stories . Because then only one person has to be responsible , rather than all the people who were fighting that night . "
38429	38452	38419	38419	She	2102	" It 's true . So — I mean — we were there too . So we were part of it too . "
38477	38483	38484	38484	he	2103	" I think about that , "
38492	38704	38484	38484	he	2103	" sometimes . I was sneaking around town in my usual way , having a high old time . It was like carnival back home in Trinidad , I thought . Everyone dancing to the music and wearing masks . I had a red mask , a monster face , and I could go anywhere I wanted . I saw John , I saw Frank . I saw you talking to Frank , in that park — you were wearing a white mask , you looked beautiful . I saw Sax down in the medina . And John was partying as usual . I — if only I had known he was in trouble , ahhh .... I mean , I had no idea that anyone was out for him . If I had only guessed , I might have been able to pull him aside and tell him to get out of the way of it . I had introduced myself to him at that party up on Olympus , just a little before that . He was happy to see me . He had found out about Hiroko and Kasei , you know . He would have listened to me , I think . But I did n't know . "
38716	38722	38710	38710	her	496	" None of us knew . "
38723	38726	38710	38710	her	496	" No . "
38727	38730	38731	38731	she	496	" Except , "
38734	38738	38731	38731	she	496	" maybe Frank . "
38742	38807	38739	38739	Desmond	489	" Maybe . But maybe not . And if he did know , then that would be bad , sure . But if I know him , he would have paid for it later , in his mind . Because those two were close . It would be like killing your brother . People pay in their mind , I believe that . So ... "
38825	38842	38810	38810	his	2104	" No need to worry about it now , Maya . They 're both gone now . "
38843	38846	38810	38810	his	2104	" Yes . "
38847	38856	38810	38810	his	2104	" They 're gone and we 're here . "

39535	39540	39532	39532	He	489	" Oh , Maya . "
39541	39546	39547	39547	He	489	" What is it ! "
39550	39581	39547	39547	He	489	" I visited Sax in Da Vinci , and Nirgal was there staying with him . His place up in the hills was covered by dust , did you hear ? "
39582	39588	39532	39532	He	489	" Yes . Too bad . "
39589	39637	39532	39532	He	489	" Yeah . But anyway they started talking about Hiroko . As if she was still alive . Sax even claimed to have seen her once , out in a storm . And I — I got so angry , Maya ! I could have killed them ! "
39638	39641	39642	39642	she	2145	" Why ? "
39645	39677	39642	39642	she	2145	" Because she 's dead . Because she 's dead and they refuse to face it . Just because they never saw the bodies , they make up all these stories . "
39681	39689	39532	39532	He	489	" They 're not the only ones . "
39690	39712	39532	39532	He	489	" No . But they believe the stories , just because they want to . As if believing makes it true . "
39713	39719	39720	39720	she	2145	" And does n't it ? "
39730	39752	39720	39720	she	2145	" No . It does n't . She 's dead . The whole farm crew . All of them were killed . "
39830	39835	39836	39836	she	496	" It 's cruel , "
39839	39866	39836	39836	she	496	" The , the disappearing . When you never see the bodies , you do n't know what to think . You 're stuck in limbo . "
39878	39886	39887	39887	he	2146	" You never saw Frank 's body , "
39890	39907	39887	39887	he	2146	" But you do n't go around telling people you think he might still be alive . "
39908	39911	39912	39912	she	496	" No , "
39920	39925	39912	39912	she	496	" But that flood ... "
39929	39954	39955	39955	He	2146	" The farm crew , though . You can see why people indulge themselves . They could have escaped , after all . Theoretically . "
39958	39997	39955	39955	He	2146	" But they were behind me in the maze . I only just got out in time . And then I hung around for days , and they did n't come out . They did n't make it . "
40018	40064	40065	40065	His	2146	" No . They were caught and killed . If they had gotten out , I would have seen them . Or she would have contacted me . She was cruel , but not that cruel . She would have let me know by now . "
40204	40209	40210	40210	she	496	" She loved you , "
40224	40241	40221	40221	he	2146	" She would have let you know if she was still around , like you say . "
40242	40247	40213	40213	He	2146	" I think so . "
40252	40271	40221	40221	he	2146	" So probably she is dead . But Nirgal and Sax — Michel too , for that matter — "
40272	40276	40221	40221	he	2146	" Michel too ? "
40277	40320	40321	40321	He	2146	" Half the time , anyway . Half the time he thinks it is just compensation , a myth that helps them . The other half he 's convinced they 're out there . But if it helps them , you know ... "
40324	40328	40321	40321	He	2146	" I suppose . "
40334	40340	40329	40329	She	496	" You love her still . "
40341	40345	40221	40221	he	2146	" I do . "
40346	40388	40221	40221	he	2146	" Well . That 's life too . Of a sort . Movement of , you know — Hiroko structures . In your mind . Quantum jumps , as Michel says . Which is all we ever are anyway . Right ? "
40400	40415	40389	40389	Desmond	489	" I do n't know . I think we are maybe more than that . "
40416	40437	40221	40221	he	2146	" Well . Whatever . It 's life that matters , is n't that what you told me one time ? "
40438	40442	40221	40221	he	2146	" Did I ? "
40443	40465	40466	40466	He	2146	" I think so . It seems like you did . A good working principle , anyway , whoever said it . "
40492	40503	40504	40504	Maya	496	" I worry that another bad time may be coming , "
40512	40551	40504	40504	Maya	496	" I do n't think Earth will let us get away with the immigration controls much longer . They 'll break them and Free Mars will protest , and we 'll be at war before you know it . "
40557	40565	40552	40552	He	2146	" I think we can avoid it . "
40566	40581	40504	40504	Maya	496	" But how ? Jackie would start a war just to keep her power . "
40582	40605	40552	40552	He	2146	" Do n't worry so much about Jackie . She does n't matter . The system is so much bigger than her — "
40606	40647	40648	40648	He	2146	" But what if the systems collide ? We 're living on borrowed time . The two worlds have very different interests now , and diverging more all the time . And then the people at the top will matter . "
40653	40672	40648	40648	He	2146	" There are so many of them . We can tip the majority of them toward reasonable behavior . "
40673	40681	40552	40552	He	2146	" Can we ? Tell me how . "
40682	40722	40648	40648	He	2146	" Well , we can always threaten them with the reds . There are still reds out there , plotting away . Trying to crash the terraforming any way they can . We can use that to our advantage . "
40805	40820	40800	40800	Desmond	489	" After all these years , we still think we can save the world . "
40821	40826	40827	40827	Maya	496	" Well we can , "
40830	40846	40827	40827	Maya	496	" Or we could , if only they would do what we told them to . "
41572	41583	41567	41567	he	489	" I have to tell you my latest Maya dream . "
41584	41588	41822	41822	he	2185	" Maya dream ? "
41589	41668	41567	41567	he	489	" Yes . I have them every year or so . I dream about all of us , really . But this one was funny . I dreamed I was going to Underhill to attend some conference , on gift economies or something , and I got there and lo and behold you were there too , attending a hydrological conference . A coincidence . And not only that , but we were staying at the same hotel — "
41669	41675	41567	41567	he	489	" A hotel in Underhill ? "
41676	41804	41822	41822	he	2185	" In my dream it was a city like any other , with skyscrapers and a lot of hotels . A conference center or something like that . So anyway , not only were we both staying at the same hotel , but they had made a mistake and booked us into the same room . We were happy to see each other in the lobby , because we had n't known we were both going to be in town , but we did n't discover we were accidentally put in the same room until we were up there in the hall , looking at our key tabs . And so , being responsible people , we went back down to the desk to explain the error — "
41833	41916	41822	41822	he	2185	" But then when we got to the desk , the night clerk gave us the same look you 're giving me now , and he said , ' Listen you two , I am Cupid , the god of love , and I made that mistake on purpose , to give you two a chance to be together without having planned it , so get back up there and have fun , and do n't try to cross me anymore ! ' "
41928	41933	41934	41934	Maya	496	" A great dream , "
41945	41949	41934	41934	Maya	496	" And then ? "
41950	41989	41990	41990	She	496	" Ah , well , then I woke up ! I was laughing too hard , just like now . I said , No , no , do n't wake up yet ! The good part is coming ! "
41997	42007	41990	41990	She	496	" No . The good part had already happened . "
43490	43498	43487	43487	hers	2253	" you 've got to be kidding , "

Another faction wants to make something go Coyote Makes Trouble 93 wrong with the deep thermal bombs .

46631	46647	46648	46648	Maya	496	" I suppose we should hope that UNTA knocks out those groups before they act . "
46666	46690	46661	46661	UNTA	606	" No . We should warn them they are penetrated . Then get them to stop their crazies . Follow the general strategy . "

Life in a box is life in a prison , even if it is a prison of one 's own devise . No , we would have gone mad . Many who go there come back damaged for life .

Looking at the evidence , I said then that it was a project in big trouble . Now we should look at the current situation . We have moved incrementally on Mars , taken things in their proper sequence . The infrastructure is now there in place to start making it an easier place to live . Perhaps now is the time for permanent settlers . "

I only started writing the journals in my eighties , so the references are n't very clear . But I know we met , even if I ca n't say I remember it . "
54569	54572	54553	54553	She	2717	" total recall "
54636	54646	54647	54647	she	2717	" You 'll have to tell me about it , "
54663	54669	54670	54670	Her	2717	" We were about twentyfive . "
54676	54683	54670	54670	Her	2717	" You really do remember everything . "
54715	54721	54722	54722	she	2717	" And we were ... ? "
54725	54730	54731	54731	Roger	550	" We were friends , "
54845	54852	54853	54853	Stephan	618	" Come on , Mr. Memory , "
54858	54874	54853	54853	Stephan	618	" Let 's eat ! I 'm starving , and it 's freezing out here . "
54875	54883	54884	54884	Roger	550	" It 'll get colder up there , "
54998	55004	55005	55006	Ivan Vivanov	625	" We 're the Sherpas , "
55167	55274	55159	55159	she	551	" We 're going to start up the Great Gully , which is the standard route for the first thousand meters of the face . Then , where the first ascent followed the Nansen Ridge up to the left of the Gully , we 're planning to go right . Dougal and Marie have seen a line in the aerial photos that they think will go , and that will give us something new to try . So we 'll have a new route most of the way . And we 'll be the smallest party ever to climb the scarp in the South Buttress area . "
55275	55280	55281	55282	Arthur Sternbach	491	" You 're kidding ! "
55289	55315	55285	55285	Eileen	551	" Because of the party size , we 'll be carrying as little oxygen as possible , for use in the last few thousand meters . "
55316	55323	55324	55324	Roger	550	" And if we climb it ? "
55327	55358	55324	55324	Roger	550	" There 's a cache for us when we top out — we'll change equipment there and stroll on up to the caldera rim . That part will be easy . "
55359	55372	55373	55373	Marie	616	" I do n't see why we even bother with that part , "
55376	55398	55399	55399	Eileen	551	" It 's the easiest way down . Besides , some of us want to see the top of Olympus Mons , "
55403	55411	55413	55413	Marie	616	" It 's just a big hill , "
55510	55520	55521	55521	Arthur	491	" I ca n't believe how tall it is ! "
55534	55540	55529	55529	He	491	" It 's just unbelievable ! "
55544	55549	55550	55550	Hans	619	" From this vantage , "
55553	55565	55550	55550	Hans	619	" the top is over seventy degrees above our real horizon . "
55566	55577	55579	55579	Arthur	491	" You 're kidding ! I ca n't believe it ! "
55956	55980	55943	55943	Noyova	628	" The reds are finished , Clayborne . You should n't be holding office — you are the leader of a dead party . "

56618	56629	56605	56605	he	491	" How do you balance with one of these on ? "
56630	56636	56637	56637	Hans	619	" You 'll find out , "
56728	56737	56738	56738	Roger	550	" Whoah ! Look out there ! Sorry ! "
56892	56897	56898	56898	Ivan	625	" The Khumbu Rockfall , "
56992	57020	57021	57021	Arthur	491	" There 's aconite , and those are anemones , and that 's a kind of iris , and those are gentians , and those are primulas .... "
57026	57033	57021	57021	Arthur	491	" What the hell is that ! "
57050	57057	57058	57058	Hans	619	" It 's a dune dog , "
57062	57079	57058	57058	Hans	619	" They 've clipped some marmot and Weddell seal genes onto what is basically a wolverine . "
57080	57093	57096	57096	Roger	550	" You 're kidding ! It looks like a miniature polar bear . "
57518	57524	57504	57504	he	550	" See the blood pheasant ? "
57525	57528	57485	57485	Hans	619	" No . "
57529	57543	57485	57485	Hans	619	" Over there . The head tuft is black . Pretty well camouflaged . "
57544	57554	57504	57504	he	550	" You 're kidding . Why there it is ! "
57555	57576	57485	57485	Hans	619	" They like these rocks . Blood pheasants , redstarts , accentors — more of them than we ever see . "
57579	57583	57485	57485	Hans	619	" Look there ! "
57584	57587	57588	57588	Roger	550	" Where ? "
57599	57618	57590	57590	himself	550	" On the tall rock , see ? The killer rabbit , they call it . A joke . "
57619	57625	57626	57626	Arthur	491	" Oh , a joke , "
57642	57648	57629	57629	Roger	550	" A rabbit with fangs ? "
57649	57694	57590	57590	himself	550	" Not exactly . Actually there 's very little hare in it — more lemming and pika , but with some important traits of the lynx added . A very successful creature . Some of Harry Whitebook 's work . He 's very good . "
57698	57708	57629	57629	Roger	550	" So some of your biological designers become famous ? "
57709	57743	57629	57629	Roger	550	" Oh yes . Very much so . Whitebook is one of the best of the mammal designers . And we seem to have a special love for mammals , do n't we ? "
57744	57750	57629	57629	Roger	550	" I know I do . "
57760	57773	57629	57629	Roger	550	" I just do n't understand how they can survive the cold ! "
57774	57880	57629	57629	Roger	550	" Well , it 's not that cold down here , of course . This is the top of the alpine zone , in effect . The adaptations for cold are usually taken directly from arctic and antarctic creatures . Many seals can cut the circulation to their extremities when necessary to preserve heat . And they have a sort of antifreeze in their blood — a glycoprotein that binds to the surface of ice crystals and stops their growth — stops the accumulation of salts . Wonderful stuff . Some of these mammals can freeze limbs and thaw them without damage to the flesh . "
57881	57886	57887	57887	Roger	550	" You 're kidding , "
57893	57898	57887	57887	Roger	550	" You 're kidding ! "
57899	57923	57924	57924	Roger	550	" And these adaptations are part of most Martian mammals . Look ! There 's a little foxbear . That 's Whitebook again . "
58078	58107	58074	58075	Marie Whillans	616	" Look , Dougal and I have already gone nearly a thousand meters up these so - called blank slabs . There are cracks all over the place . "
58108	58118	58119	58119	Eileen	551	" As far as you 've gone there are , "
58122	58149	58119	58119	Eileen	551	" But the true slabs are supposed to be above those first cracks . Four hundred meters of smooth rock . We could be stopped outright . "
58150	58190	58191	58192	Hans Boethe	619	" So we could , but there 's got to be some cracks . And we can bolt our way up any really blank sections if we have to . That way we 'd have a completely new route . "
58197	58211	58194	58194	his	2835	" Putting bolts in some of this basalt wo n't be any fun . "
58215	58221	58222	58222	Eileen	551	" I hate bolts anyway , "
58225	58262	58222	58222	Eileen	551	" The point is , if we take the Gully up to the first amphitheater , we know we 've got a good route to the top , and all the upper pitches will be new . "
58286	58301	58283	58283	Marie	616	" The point is , what kind of climb do we want to have ? "
58302	58311	58312	58312	Eileen	551	" We want to get to the top , "
58341	58346	58347	58347	Marie	616	" Wait a second , "
58358	58381	58347	58347	Marie	616	" That 's not what it 's about . We 're not here just to repeat the Gully route , are we ? "
58393	58422	58382	58382	Her	616	" That was n't what I was told , anyway . I was told we were taking a new route , and that 's why I 'm here . "
58423	58432	58433	58433	Eileen	551	" It will inevitably be a new route , "
58436	58473	58433	58433	Eileen	551	" You know that , Marie . We trend right at the top of the Gully and we 're on new ground . We only avoid the blank slabs that flank the Gully to the right ! "
58474	58483	58484	58484	Marie	616	" I think we should try those slabs , "
58487	58498	58484	58484	Marie	616	" because Dougal and I have found they 'll go . "
58545	58597	58542	58542	Eileen	551	" Climbing any route on this wall with only eleven people will be doing something . Look , we 're only talking about the first twelve hundred meters of the climb . Above that we 'll trend to the right whenever possible , and be on new ground above those slabs . "
58598	58607	58608	58608	Marie	616	" I do n't believe in the slabs , "
58618	58644	58608	58608	Marie	616	" Well , that being the case , I do n't see why you sent Dougal and me up the slabs these last few days . "
58645	58653	58654	58654	Eileen	551	" I did n't send you up , "
58661	58715	58654	58654	Eileen	551	" You two choose the leads , you know that . But this is a fundamental choice , and I think the Gully is the opening pitch we came to make . We do want to make the top , you know . Not just of the wall , but the whole mountain . "
58722	58743	58719	58719	Marie	616	" Okay . You 're the boss . But it makes me wonder . Why are we making this climb ? "
59033	59045	59046	59046	Hans	619	" I 'm not in the best of shape for this , "
59049	59062	59046	59046	Hans	619	" It may take me a few days to get my rhythm . "
59063	59070	59071	59071	Roger	550	" Do n't worry about me , "
59074	59085	59071	59071	Roger	550	" We 're going about as fast as I like . "
59086	59096	59046	59046	Hans	619	" I wonder how far above Camp Two is ? "
59097	59113	59046	59046	Hans	619	" Not too far . Too many carries to make , without the power reels . "
59114	59137	59071	59071	Roger	550	" I look forward to the vertical pitches . If we 're going to climb we might as well climb , eh ? "
59138	59150	59046	59046	Hans	619	" Especially since the power reels will pull our stuff up . "
59151	59154	59155	59155	Breathless	631	" Yes . "
59378	59387	59388	59388	Eileen	551	" Let 's get up to Camp Two , "
59600	59610	59594	59595	Eileen Monday	551	" So we were friends once , you say . "
59611	59614	59615	59615	Roger	550	" Yeah . "
59622	59630	59615	59615	Roger	550	" You do n't remember at all ? "
59631	59639	59615	59615	Roger	550	" It was a long time ago . "
59640	59656	59615	59615	Roger	550	" Yes . I was twenty - six , you were about twenty - three . "
59657	59665	59615	59615	Roger	550	" You really remember that long ago ? "
59666	59673	59674	59674	Eileen	551	" Some of it , yes . "
59690	59741	59742	59742	She	551	" I wish I did . But as I get older my memory gets even worse . Now I think for every year I live I lose at least that much in memories . It 's sad . My whole life before I was seventy or eighty — all gone . "
59745	59761	59742	59742	She	551	" I know most people are like that , though . You 're an exception . "
59762	59775	59777	59777	Roger	550	" Some things seem to be stuck in my mind for good , "
59808	59817	59742	59742	She	551	" Have you hit your three hundredth yet ? "
59818	59834	59742	59742	She	551	" In a few months . But — come on . Tell me about it . "
59835	59853	59854	59854	She	551	" Well ... you were a student . Or just finishing school , I ca n't remember . "
59857	59934	59854	59854	She	551	" Anyway , I was guiding groups in hikes through the little canyons north of here , and you were part of a group . We Green Mars 119 started up a — a little affair , as I recall . And saw each other for a while after we got back . But you were in Burroughs , and I kept guiding tours , and — well , you know . It did n't last . "
59939	59973	59974	59974	She	551	" So I went on to become a mountain guide — which I 've been for as long as I can remember — while you moved to the city and got into politics ! "
59981	59990	59977	59977	Roger	550	" Obviously we must have impressed each other ! "
59991	59997	59998	59998	Roger	550	" Oh yes , yes . "
60002	60008	59998	59998	Roger	550	" Searching for each other . "
60016	60036	60009	60009	He	550	" Actually I only got into government about forty years ago . Too late , as it turned out . "
60042	60052	60053	60053	Eileen	551	" So that 's what 's got you down , "
60056	60059	60053	60053	Eileen	551	" What ? "
60060	60070	59977	59977	Roger	550	" The Red Mars party — out of favor . "
60071	60079	60053	60053	Eileen	551	" Out of existence , you mean . "
60084	60095	60053	60053	Eileen	551	" I never could understand the Red point of view — "
60096	60102	59977	59977	Roger	550	" Few could , apparently . "
60103	60127	59977	59977	Roger	550	" — until I read something in Heidegger , where he makes a distinction between earth and world . Do you know it ? "
60128	60131	60053	60053	Eileen	551	" No . "
60132	60180	60181	60181	Roger	550	" Earth is that blank materiality of nature that exists before us and more or less sets the parameters on what we can do . Sartre called it facticity . World then is the human realm , the social and historical dimension that gives earth its meaning . "
60186	60228	60181	60181	Roger	550	" So — the Reds , as I understood it , were defending earth . Or planet , in this case . Trying to protect the primacy of planet over world — or at least to hold a balance between them . "
60229	60232	60233	60233	Roger	550	" Yes , "
60236	60244	60233	60233	Roger	550	" But the world inundated the planet . "
60245	60311	60181	60181	Roger	550	" True . But when you look at it that way , you can see what you were trying to do was hopeless . A political party is inevitably part of the world , and everything it does will be worldly . And we only know the materiality of nature through our human senses — so really it is only world that we know directly . "
60312	60320	60321	60321	Roger	550	" I 'm not sure about that , "
60324	60344	60345	60345	He	550	" I mean , it 's logical , and usually I 'm sure it 's true — but sometimes — "
60357	60361	60353	60353	his	550	" You know ? "
60367	60370	60371	60371	Roger	550	" World . "
60390	60393	60378	60378	He	550	" Planet . "
60398	60401	60394	60394	Eileen	551	" Maybe . "
60459	60466	60467	60467	she	551	" We 'll continue this later , "
61024	61034	61038	61038	his	2890	" the most insignificant of the Pequod 's crew , "
61057	61080	61054	61054	Pip	635	" The intense concentration of self in the middle of such a heartless immensity , my God ! who can tell it ? "
61095	61140	61087	61087	Pip	635	" By the merest chance the ship itself at last rescued him ; but from that hour the little Negro went about the deck an idiot .... The sea had jeeringly kept his finite body up , but drowned the infinite of his soul . "

61572	61577	61578	61578	Roger	550	" Who said that ? "
61586	61589	61590	61590	she	551	" Shelley , "

61620	61627	61613	61613	She	551	" Come join us for dinner ? "
61628	61644	61532	61532	She	551	" What ? Oh sure , sure . I did n't know it was time . "
61865	61874	61875	61875	he	550	" I just do n't have it today , "
61884	61888	61889	61889	she	623	" Me neither , "
61896	61912	61889	61889	she	623	" I think we 'll have to start using oxygen during the climbing pretty soon . "
61993	62006	62007	62007	Dougal	560	" Great , we were just about to run out of rope . "
62024	62027	62028	62028	she	616	" Look , "
62059	62067	62068	62068	Marie	616	" That Terran expedition , I bet , "
62071	62082	62068	62068	Marie	616	" They left ropes the entire way , I hear . "
62093	62101	62102	62102	Frances	623	" I hate seeing stuff like that . "
62105	62117	62102	62102	Frances	623	" I think we 'd better go onto oxygen pretty soon . "
62124	62127	62129	62129	Marie	616	" Why ? "
62131	62137	62129	62129	Marie	616	" We 've barely started . "
62138	62151	62129	62129	Marie	616	" Well , we 're at about four kilometers above the datum — "
62152	62155	62156	62156	Marie	616	" Exactly , "
62159	62166	62156	62156	Marie	616	" I live higher than that . "
62167	62193	62129	62129	Marie	616	" Yes , but we 're working pretty hard here , and going up pretty fast . I do n't want anyone to get edema . "
62194	62202	62203	62203	Marie	616	" I do n't feel a thing , "
62212	62221	62222	62222	Dougal	560	" I could use a bit of oxygen , "

62307	62314	62299	62299	her	616	" Down you come , boy . "
62315	62320	62271	62271	Dougal	560	" On your head . "
62321	62330	62331	62331	Frances	623	" We 'll see how the weather goes , "
62334	62351	62331	62331	Frances	623	" But either way , if we make normal progress we 'll be needing oxygen soon . "
62933	62944	62945	62945	Roger	550	" Let 's hope no one is following us up , "
62948	62954	62945	62945	Roger	550	" Not supposed to be . "
62958	62976	62945	62945	Roger	550	" I guess getting out of this Gully wo n't be such a bad idea , eh ? "
62977	63015	62945	62945	Roger	550	" Rockfall is almost as bad on the face . Last year Marie had a party on the face when a rock fell on a traverse rope and cut it . Client making the traverse was killed . "
63016	63021	63080	63080	She	551	" A cheerful business . "
63022	63031	63035	63035	her	551	" Rockfall is bad . I hate it . "
63086	63090	63080	63080	She	551	" You know . "
63094	63100	63080	63080	She	551	" No precautions to take . "
63101	63116	63117	63119	The lead climbers	2735	" Exactly . Well , there are some . But they are n't sufficient . "
63202	63210	63211	63211	Roger	550	" I wonder how long this lasts , "
63238	63244	63235	63235	she	551	" Three hundred more meters , "
63407	63411	63412	63412	Eileen	551	" Nice campsite , "
63439	63452	63422	63422	Ginger	626	" Looked like you had a hard day of it down there . "
63453	63456	63457	63457	Dougal	560	" Invigorating , "
63467	63478	63463	63463	Eileen	551	" Looks like a little oxygen might be in order . "
63487	63501	63480	63484	THE MARTIANS The lead group	2947	" I know , I know . Just a little . A cocktail . "
63502	63510	63511	63511	Marie	616	" It only makes you crave it , "
63514	63528	63511	63511	Marie	616	" Maybe so . We ca n't use much down here , anyway . "
63552	63574	63539	63539	Eileen	551	" Bring those and the power reels up first . We should be able to use the reels between these camps . "
63718	63755	63756	63756	Eileen	551	" Look , Marie , the rest of us have n't led a single pitch , have we ? And we did n't come on this climb to ferry up goods for you , did we ? "
63789	63867	63773	63773	Marie	616	" That 's not the point . Get back down to Camp One tomorrow , and finish bringing it up . The bottom team will move up and reel Camp Two up to Three , and those of us here at Two will carry one load up to Three and have a bash at the lead after that . That 's the way it is , Marie — we leapfrog in my climbs , you know that . "
63886	63912	63883	63883	Marie	616	" Aye , well you 'll need us more when the climbing gets harder anyway . But we ca n't afford to slow down much . "
64038	64041	64032	64032	Eileen	551	" Mind ? "
64042	64045	64046	64046	She	551	" No . "
64063	64077	64060	64060	He	550	" I 'm sorry Marie is being so hard to get along with . "
64087	64106	64107	64107	She	551	" Marie is always like that . It does n't mean anything . She just wants to climb . "
64110	64128	64107	64107	She	551	" We go on like this every time we climb together , but I still like her . "
64129	64132	64133	64133	Roger	550	" Hmph . "
64138	64145	64135	64135	his	550	" I would n't have guessed . "
64174	64182	64183	64183	Eileen	551	" You seem ... disturbed about something , "
64186	64189	64190	64190	Roger	550	" Ehh , "
64193	64200	64190	64190	Roger	550	" About everything , I suppose . "
64219	64227	64216	64216	She	551	" So you fought all the terraforming ? "
64228	64255	64302	64302	he	550	" Most of it , yeah . First as head of a lobbying group . You must be part of it now — Martian Wilderness Explorers . "
64256	64262	64216	64216	She	551	" I pay the dues . "
64263	64290	64216	64216	She	551	" Then in the Red government . And in the Interior Ministry , after the Greens took over . But none of it did any good . "
64291	64297	64302	64302	he	550	" And why , again ? "
64298	64301	64302	64302	he	550	" Because , "
64311	64412	64302	64302	he	550	" Because I liked the planet the way it was when we found it . A lot of us did , back then . It was so beautiful ... or not just that . It was more overwhelming than beautiful . The size of things , their shapes — the whole planet had been evolving , the landforms themselves I mean , for five billion years , and traces of all of that time were still on the surface to be seen and read , if you knew how to look . It was so wonderful to be out there . "
64413	64421	64302	64302	he	550	" The sublime is n't always beautiful . "
64422	64446	64448	64448	he	550	" True . It transcended beauty , it really did . One time I walked out onto the polar dunes , you know .... "
64457	64549	64448	64448	he	550	" And so , and so it seemed to me that we already had an Earth , you know ? That we did n't need a Terra up here . And everything they did eroded the planet that we came to . They destroyed it ! And now we 've got — whatever . Some kind of park . A laboratory to test out new plants and animals and all . And everything I loved so much about those early years is gone . You ca n't find it anywhere anymore . "
64560	64568	64557	64557	her	2961	" And so your life 's work ... "
64569	64572	64573	64573	He	550	" Wasted ! "
64612	64633	64604	64604	he	550	" A three - hundred - year life , entirely wasted ! I mean I might as well have just ... "
64643	64651	64652	64652	she	2961	" At least you can remember it , "
64656	64671	64652	64652	she	2961	" What good is that ? I 'd rather forget , I tell you . "
64672	64684	64711	64711	her	2961	" Ah . You do n't know what that 's like . "
64685	64708	64709	64709	She	2961	" Oh , the past . The God - damned past . It is n't so great . Just a dead thing . "
64714	64728	64709	64709	She	2961	" Our past is never dead . Do you know Sartre 's work ? "
64729	64732	64711	64711	her	2961	" No . "
64733	64875	64876	64876	Roger	550	" A shame . He can be a big help to we who live so long . For instance , in several places he suggests that there are two ways of looking at the past . You can think of it as something dead and fixed forever ; it 's part of you , but you ca n't change it , and you ca n't change what it means . In that case your past limits or even controls what you can be . But Sartre does n't agree with that way of looking at it . He says that the past is constantly altered by what we do in the present moment . The meaning of the past is as fluid as our freedom in the present , because every new act that we commit can revalue the entire thing ! "
64879	64882	64876	64876	Roger	550	" Existentialism . "
64883	64954	64711	64711	her	2961	" Well , whatever you want to call it . It 's part of Sartre 's philosophy of freedom , for sure . He says that the only way we can possess our past — whether we can remember it or not , I say — is to add new acts to it , which then give it a new value . He calls this ' assuming ' our past . "
64955	64964	64876	64876	Roger	550	" But sometimes that may not be possible . "
64965	65020	64876	64876	Roger	550	" Not for Sartre . The past is always assumed , because we are not free to stop creating new values for it . It 's just a question of what those values will be . For Sartre it 's a question of how you will assume your past , not whether you will . "
65021	65026	64711	64711	her	2961	" And for you ? "
65027	65055	64876	64876	Roger	550	" I 'm with him on that . That 's why I 've been reading him these last several years . It helps me to understand things . "
65056	65059	65060	65060	He	2962	" Hmph . "
65065	65079	65060	65060	He	2962	" You were an English major in college , did you know that ? "
65085	65088	65089	65089	She	2963	" So — "
65098	65119	65089	65089	She	2963	" You have to decide how you will assume this past of yours . Now that your Mars is gone . "
65127	65138	65124	65124	She	2963	" I have to plunge into the logistics for tomorrow . "
65142	65149	65154	65154	he	2962	" Okay . See you inside . "
65986	65991	65992	65992	he	550	" Come on up ! "
66078	66081	66082	66082	he	550	" Ah ! "
66505	66515	66516	66516	Eileen	551	" The Gully ends pretty near to you anyway , "
66594	66599	66589	66589	Stephan	618	" What 's that ? "
66600	66634	66589	66589	Stephan	618	" Chir pine , they call it . I saw some growing out of the rocks above Camp One . It 's amazing what you find living on the side of this cliff . "
66635	66638	66639	66639	Roger	550	" Yes , "
66642	66666	66667	66667	He	618	" Oh I know , I know . You do n't like it . But I 'm sure I do n't know why . "
66678	66716	66717	66717	He	618	" Look in the cracks across the Gully . Lot of ice there , and then patches of moss . That 's moss campion , with the lavender flowers on top of the moss cushion , see ? "
66726	66737	66721	66721	Roger	550	" That 's a wonderful talent to have , drawing . "
66738	66753	66754	66754	He	618	" Skill . Look , there 's edelweiss and asters , growing almost together . "
66764	66767	66768	66768	he	618	" Pika , "
67407	67411	67400	67400	Hans	619	" hard eon , "
67688	67697	67698	67698	He	3030	" It looks like orbicular jasper , see ? "
67735	67740	67741	67741	Roger	550	" Looks like lichen , "
67744	67748	67741	67741	Roger	550	" Fossilized lichen . "
67749	67789	67741	67741	Roger	550	" Yes . This is orbicular jasper . For it to be trapped in this basalt implies a metamorphic slush — lava partially melting rock in the throat above the magma chamber , and then throwing it all up . "
67818	67827	67828	67828	Dougal	560	" At least it 's good hard rock , "
67864	67870	67871	67871	Arthur	491	" It 's a ledge , "
67874	67929	67871	67871	Arthur	491	" A perfect ledge . I ca n't believe it . It 's about half a meter wide , and extends around this rampart for a couple hundred meters , just like a damn sidewalk ! We just walked right around that corner ! Completely vertical above and below — talk about a view ! "
67951	67962	67946	67946	Arthur	491	" There 's one like this on Half Dome in Yosemite "
68044	68055	68056	68056	Roger	550	" You and Marie walked along this ledge without ropes ? "
68059	68067	68056	68056	Roger	550	" Oh , it 's fairly wide , "
68071	68101	68056	68056	Roger	550	" Do n't you think ? I ended up crawling there where it narrows just a bit . But mostly it was fine . Marie walked the whole way . "
68102	68109	68110	68110	Roger	550	" I 'm sure she did . "
68496	68499	68525	68525	Hans	619	" mixed , "
68538	68545	68532	68533	each other	858	" Must have been Marie leading . "
68546	68559	68525	68525	Hans	619	" I do n't know , that Arthur is pretty damn good . "
68603	68609	68593	68593	Roger	550	" Need crampons up here . "
68610	68624	68532	68533	each other	858	" Except the ice is so thin , you 'd be kicking rock . "
68625	68629	68532	68533	each other	858	" Mixed climbing . "
68630	68635	68593	68593	Roger	550	" Fun , eh ? "
68678	68690	68532	68533	each other	858	" I wonder if that 's Arthur and Marie 's work . "
68738	68754	68768	68768	Arthur	491	" Hey ! Watch out up there ! You 're dropping ice chunks on us ! "
68755	68767	68768	68768	Arthur	491	" Oh ! Sorry , did n't know you were there . "
68778	68781	68782	68782	Marie	616	" Sorry , "
68786	68803	68782	68782	Marie	616	" Did n't know you 'd come up so late . Have you got more rope ? "
68804	68807	68770	68770	Marie	616	" Yeah . "
68838	68841	68842	68842	he	491	" Beautiful , "
68845	68911	68842	68842	he	491	" They have parhelia on Earth too , you know — a natural effect of the light when there 's ice crystals in the atmosphere . It 's usually seen in Antarctica — big halos around the sun , and at two points of the halo these mock suns . But I do n't think we ever had four mock suns per side . Beautiful ! "
68912	68917	68918	68918	Marie	616	" Let 's go , "
68924	68939	68918	68918	Marie	616	" We 'll see you two down 136 THE MARTIANS at Camp Five tonight . "
68964	68968	68969	68969	Stephan	618	" Strange pair , "
69024	69030	69031	69031	Arthur	491	" Can you believe this ? "
69034	69041	69031	69031	Arthur	491	" It 's a damn hotel ! "
69187	69201	69202	69202	Stephan	618	" It 's going to be nice to lie out flat for once , "
69251	69260	69261	69261	he	3061	" It 's tuff , do you see ? "
69272	69349	69261	69261	he	3061	" This is a shield volcano , meaning it ejected very little ash over the years , which is what gave it its flattened shape . But there must have been a few ash eruptions , and when the ash is compressed it becomes tuff — this rock here . Tuff is much softer than basalt and andesite , and over the years this exposed layer has eroded away , leaving us with our wonderful hotel . "
69350	69355	69357	69357	Arthur	491	" I love it , "
69479	69482	69483	69483	Arthur	491	" Hans ! "
69500	69518	69483	69483	Arthur	491	" Get over here , Hans . Have a seat . There you go . Sit down . "
69528	69570	69571	69571	Frances	623	" All right , Hans , tell me something . Why is this cave here ? And why , for that matter , is this escarpment here ? Why is Olympus Mons the only volcano anywhere to have this encircling cliff ? "
69574	69587	69571	69571	Frances	623	" It 's not the only volcano to have such a feature . "
69588	69593	69594	69594	Hans	619	" Now , Frances , "
69597	69629	69630	69630	Frances	623	" You know it 's the only big shield volcano with a surrounding escarpment . The analogies from Iceland that you 're referring to are just little vents of larger volcanoes . "
69633	69645	69630	69630	Frances	623	" That 's true . But the analogy may still hold . "
69646	69649	69650	69650	Hans	619	" Perhaps . "
69655	69693	69650	69650	Hans	619	" You see , there is still not a perfect agreement as to the cause of the scarp . But I think I can say that my theory is generally accepted — wouldn't you agree , Frances ? "
69694	69697	69698	69698	Hans	619	" Yes .... "
69708	69757	69698	69698	Hans	619	" You see , Frances is one of those who believe that the volcano originally grew up through a glacial cap , and that the glacier made in effect a retaining wall , holding in the lava and creating this drop - off after the glacial cap disappeared . "
69758	69773	69774	69774	Frances	623	" There are good analogies in Iceland for this particular shape for a volcano , "
69777	69790	69774	69774	Frances	623	" And it 's eruption under and through ice that explains it . "
69791	69798	69799	69799	Hans	619	" Be that as it may , "
69802	69822	69799	69799	Hans	619	" I am among those who feel that the weight of Olympus Mons is the cause of the scarp . "
69823	69830	69831	69831	Arthur	491	" You said that once before , "
69834	69845	69831	69831	Arthur	491	" but I do n't understand how that would work . "
69867	70044	69864	69864	He	618	" The volcano is extremely old , you understand . Three billion years or so , on this same site , or close to it — very little tectonic drift , unlike on Earth . So magma upwells , lava spills out , over and over and over , and it is deposited over softer material — probably the gardened regolith that resulted from the intensive meteor bombardments of the planet 's earliest years . A tremendous weight is deposited on the surface of the planet , you see , and this weight increases as the volcano grows . As we all know now , it is a very , very big volcano . And eventually the weight is so great that it squishes out the softer material beneath it . We find this material to the northeast , which is the downhill side of the Tharsis Bulge , and is naturally the side that the pressured rock would be pushed out to . 138 THE MARTIANS Have any of you visited the Olympus Mons aureole ? "
70050	70054	69864	69864	He	618	" Fascinating region . "
70055	70058	70059	70059	Arthur	491	" Okay , "
70062	70095	70059	70059	Arthur	491	" but why would n't that just sink the whole area ? I would think that there would be a depression circling the edge of the volcano , rather than this cliff . "
70096	70099	70100	70100	Stephan	618	" Exactly ! "
70124	70259	70116	70116	He	618	" The point is , the lava shield of Olympus Mons is a single unit of rock — layered , admittedly , but essentially one big cap of basalt , placed on a slightly soft surface . Now by far the greatest part of the weight of this cap is near the center — the volcano 's peak , you know , still so far above us . So — the cap is a unit , a single piece of rock — and basalt has a certain flexibility to it , as all rock does . So the cap itself is somewhat flexible . Now the center of it sinks the farthest , being heaviest — and the outside edge of the shield , being part of a single flexible cap , bends upward . "
70260	70266	70267	70267	Arthur	491	" Up twenty thousand feet ? "
70270	70275	70276	70276	Hans	619	" You 're kidding ! "
70279	70330	70276	70276	Hans	619	" You must remember that the volcano stands twentyfive kilometers above the surrounding plains . The volume of the volcano is one hundred times the volume of Earth 's largest volcano , Mauna Loa , and for three billion years at least it has been pressing down on this spot . "
70331	70351	70352	70352	Frances	623	" But it does n't make sense that the scarp would be so symmetrical if that was what happened , "
70355	70507	70508	70508	Hans	619	" On the contrary . In fact that is the really telling aspect of it . The outer edge of the lava shield is lifted up , okay ? Higher and higher , until the flexibility of the basalt is exceeded . In other words , the shield is just so flexible and no more . At the point where the stress becomes too much , the rock sheers off , and the inner side of the break continues to rise , while what is beyond the break point subsides . So , the plains down below us are still part of the lava shield of Olympus Mons , but they are beyond the break point . And as the lava was everywhere approximately the same thickness , it gave way everywhere at about the same distance from the peak , giving us the roughly circular escarpment that we now climb ! "
70524	70531	70532	70532	He	491	" It 's hard to believe . "
70537	70553	70532	70532	He	491	" So the other half of this cave is underneath the talus wash down there ? "
70554	70557	70558	70558	Hans	619	" Exactly . "
70561	70629	70558	70558	Hans	619	" Though the other half was never a cave . This was probably a small , roughly circular layer of tuff , trapped in much harder basaltic lava . But when the shield broke and the escarpGreen Mars 139 ment was formed , the tuff deposit was cut in half , exposing its side to erosion . And a few eons later we have our cozy cave . "
70630	70635	70636	70636	Arthur	491	" Hard to believe , "
70685	70702	70703	70703	he	550	" It 's the amount of time necessary for these transformations that 's difficult to imagine , "
70707	70712	70703	70703	he	550	" It must take ... "
70718	70723	70724	70724	Hans	619	" Billions of years , "
70727	70749	70724	70724	Hans	619	" We can not properly imagine that amount of time . But we can see the sure signs of its passing . "
70950	70970	70971	70971	Marie	616	" The trick is to stay in the moat between the ice in the gully and the rock wall , "
70985	71002	71003	71003	Dougal	560	" Or to be where you want to be by the time the sun comes up , "
71375	71384	71364	71364	Arthur	491	" Spiderman , Spiderman , Spiderman , Spidermannnnn . "
71561	71566	71567	71567	she	551	" Time for oxygen , "
71926	71930	71931	71931	she	551	" Like ships ! "
71935	71941	71942	71942	Roger	550	" Ships of the line ! "
71950	71959	71942	71942	Roger	550	" Do you think a storm might come ? "
71960	71974	71975	71975	She	551	" I would n't be surprised . We 've been lucky so far . "
72155	72164	None	None	None	None	" What 's the barometer say , Hans ? "
72165	72172	None	None	None	None	" Four hundred and ten millibars . "
72173	72178	None	None	None	None	" You 're kidding ! "
72179	72190	None	None	None	None	" That 's not too far below normal , actually . "
72191	72196	None	None	None	None	" You 're kidding . "
72197	72215	72309	72309	She	551	" It is low , however . I believe we are being overtaken by a lowpressure system . "
72312	72330	72309	72309	She	551	" Get used to it — there are downdrafts hitting the upper face more often than not . "
72333	72356	72357	72357	Roger	550	" Although this one does seem to be a bit stronger than usual . But it 's not snowing , is it ? "
72367	72370	72309	72309	She	551	" Nope . "
72371	72374	72382	72382	He	550	" Good . "
72375	72381	72403	72403	She	551	" Awful cold , though . "
72389	72402	72492	72492	Roger	550	" That 's okay . Snow would be a really bad sign . "
72498	72520	72899	72899	Roger	550	" Everyone stay inside tomorrow morning until they hear from me at mirror dawn . We 'll have another conference then . "
72893	72898	72899	72899	Roger	550	" Wind 's up , "
72902	72907	72912	72912	She	551	" Want some tea ? "
72908	72911	72923	72923	She	551	" Mmmph . "
72919	72922	72923	72923	She	551	" Yeah . "
72931	72934	72899	72899	Roger	550	" Thirsty . "
72935	72945	72899	72899	Roger	550	" Yeah . The masks seem to do that . "
72946	72952	72923	72923	She	551	" What time is it ? "
72953	72956	72899	72899	Roger	550	" Four . "
72957	72973	73009	73009	he	550	" Ah . My alarm must have woken me . Almost time for the call . "
73003	73008	73009	73009	he	550	" Got ta go , "
73025	73030	73125	73125	she	551	" Stay harnessed up ! "
73130	73138	73150	73150	She	551	" You know what Dougal would say . "
73139	73149	73239	73239	he	560	" Oh , it was very invigorating all right . "
73228	73238	73239	73239	he	560	" Our tent has been smashed by a rock , "
73245	73261	73267	73267	Roger	550	" Frances has got her arm broken . I need some help getting her down . "
73262	73266	73323	73324	Grimly Eileen	551	" Down where ? "
73274	73322	73632	73632	she	623	" Well , I thought to the cave , anyway . Or at least to here — our tent 's crushed , she 's pretty much out in the open right now — in her bag , you know , but the tent 's not doing much . "
73612	73631	73646	73646	Eileen	551	" I think I can sit up in a sling and rappel down if you can help me , "
73639	73644	73646	73646	Eileen	551	" How are you ? "
73648	73700	73738	73738	They	3146	" The left arm 's broken just above the elbow . I 've made a bit of a splint for it . I 'm awfully cold , but other than that I do n't feel too bad . I 've taken some painkillers , but not enough to make me sleepy . "
73750	73756	73646	73646	Eileen	551	" What time is it ? "
73757	73760	73738	73738	They	3146	" Two . "
73761	73769	73738	73738	They	3146	" We 'd better be off then . "
73770	73773	74334	74334	Dougal	560	" Yeah . "
74323	74333	74352	74352	Eileen	551	" I 'll go down and get a load , "
74340	74351	74352	74352	Eileen	551	" But you 've already been out a long time , "
74355	74382	74334	74334	Dougal	560	" No no . A hot meal and I 'll be off again . You should stay here with Frances , and Roger 's chilled down . "
74383	74394	74441	74441	Eileen	551	" We can get Arthur or Hans to come up . "
74395	74440	74441	74441	Eileen	551	" We do n't want movement up , do we ? They 'd have to stay up here , and we 're out of room as it is . Besides , I 'm the most used to climbing in this wind in the dark . "
74444	74447	74454	74454	Dougal	560	" Okay . "
74448	74453	74501	74501	Frances	623	" You warm enough ? "
74492	74500	74501	74501	Frances	623	" A good sign he 's shivering , "
74506	74525	74577	74577	Frances	623	" But he 's awfully cold . Maybe too hypothermic to warm up . I 'm cold myself . "
74571	74576	74577	74577	Frances	623	" I 'm okay , "
74583	74591	74620	74620	Eileen	551	" Good'n warm . Get him now . "
74613	74619	74660	74660	Eileen	551	" Get your outers off , "
74652	74659	74660	74660	Eileen	551	" Man , you are cold , "
74663	74668	74669	74669	Roger	550	" ' Predate it , "
74673	74680	74726	74726	She	551	" Do n't know what happened . "
74681	74711	74726	74726	She	551	" We did n't work you hard enough on the descent . Plus you had to bare your butt to a windchill factor I would n't want to guess . "
74733	74745	74760	74760	He	550	" Not yet . Turn around . Here . Drink this . "
74755	74759	74794	74794	he	560	" Drink this ! "
74789	74793	75119	75119	Marie	616	" Pretty desperate , "
75098	75118	75130	75130	Frances	623	" Look , I do n't want to go down just because one of us has a busted arm , "
75122	75128	75169	75169	Marie	616	" I ca n't climb , "
75163	75168	75169	75169	Marie	616	" I know that , "
75172	75273	75274	75274	Eileen	551	" But we could split up . It 'll only take a few people to get you back down to the cars . The rest of us can take the rest of the gear and carry on . If we get to the cache at the top of the scarp , we wo n't have to worry about supplies . If we do n't , we 'll just follow you down . But I do n't fancy us giving up now — that 's not what we came for , eh ? Going down when we do n't have to ? "
75279	75291	75306	75306	he	625	" It 'd be up to you to get Frances down . "
75297	75305	75306	75306	he	625	" That 's what Sherpas are for , "
75310	75321	75274	75274	Eileen	551	" Do you think four will be enough for it ? "
75322	75332	75391	75391	him	625	" More would probably just get in the way . "
75361	75387	75430	75430	she	551	" It seems to me that our primary responsibility is to get Frances to the ground safely . The climb can be finished another time . "
75420	75429	75430	75430	she	551	" Marie 's plan sounds good to me , "
75433	75454	75466	75466	Hans	619	" We 've got the supplies to go both ways , and the Sherpas can get Frances down by themselves . "
75455	75465	75485	75485	Marie	616	" Neither group will have much margin for error , "
75472	75484	75485	75485	Marie	616	" We can leave the water for the group going down , "
75488	75502	75518	75518	Hans	619	" There 'll be ice and snow the rest of the way up . "
75503	75517	75518	75518	Hans	619	" We 'll have to be a bit more sparing with the oxygen , "
75521	75534	75539	75539	Eileen	551	" Frances should have enough to take her all the way down . "
75535	75538	75539	75539	Eileen	551	" Yes , "
75542	75565	75571	75571	Marie	616	" We 'll have to get going again in the next day or two , no matter what the weather 's like . "
75566	75569	75571	75571	Marie	616	" Well ? "
75573	75608	75539	75539	Eileen	551	" We 've proved we can get up and down the fixed ropes in any weather . We should get up and fix Camp Nine as soon as we can . Tomorrow , say . "
75609	75619	75539	75539	Eileen	551	" If there 's a bit of a break . "
75620	75630	75571	75571	Marie	616	" We 've got to stock the higher camps — "
75631	75647	75802	75802	she	616	" Yeah . We 'll do what we can , Marie . Do n't fret . "
75790	75801	75802	75802	she	616	" Well , you 'll be going down , right ? "
75807	75823	75836	75836	Ivan	625	" You do n't need oxygen at all once you get a couple camps down . "
75824	75835	75802	75802	she	616	" Frances will need it a lot longer than that , "
75839	75856	75802	75802	she	616	" And we ca n't be sure how long it 'll take to get her down . "
75857	75883	75893	75893	Eileen	551	" Hell , you can reel her down once you get past the Thank God Ledge . Should n't take you any time at all — "
75884	75892	75893	75893	Eileen	551	" Marie , get out of this , "
75896	75914	76047	76047	Frances	623	" We 'll divide the supplies . There 's no reason for you to bother with this . "
76037	76046	76113	76113	he	550	" We have to stop meeting like this , "
76108	76112	76113	76113	he	550	" Bad luck , "
76117	76126	76140	76140	she	623	" You 'll get another chance , though . "
76127	76139	76150	76150	She	623	" Thanks for grabbing me during the drop from Camp Nine , "
76154	76175	76185	76185	Roger	550	" You 're awfully quick . That would have hurt like hell if I had rolled onto my left side . "
76176	76184	76207	76207	Frances	623	" I 'm glad I could help , "
76194	76203	76597	76597	he	550	" I like how tough you 've been . "
76591	76596	77450	77450	Arthur	491	" Pretty bloody desperate , "
77438	77449	77755	77755	Dougal	560	" Just like the Devil 's Kitchen on Ben Nevis , "
77739	77754	77768	77768	Eileen	551	" It 's a bit like swimming up the thing , is n't it ? "
77778	77780	77893	77893	her	3231	" ladder "
77895	77899	78346	78346	Arthur	491	" Mad Mahdi , "
78349	78386	78475	78475	himself	550	" That happened to me a couple of nights ago . I do n't think anybody could sleep through their oxygen bottle running out — I mean you wake up very awake , do n't you ? "
78455	78464	78667	78667	Arthur	491	" Must have been Dougal at it again . "
78658	78666	78696	78696	Roger	650	" By God we are a team ! "
78677	78695	78696	78696	Roger	650	" Eileen , you should put us together more often . Do n't you agree , Roger ? "
78703	78708	78735	78735	them	3246	" That was fun . "
78742	78751	78782	78782	Marie	616	" but that was nothing compared to today . "
78776	78781	78863	78863	Eileen	551	" Bloody desperate out ! "
78868	78885	78895	78895	Stephan	618	" Eileen , this is Arthur . I 'm afraid Stephan has come up too fast . "
78910	78932	78939	78939	Stephan	618	" He 's very short of breath , and he 's spitting up bloody spit . And talking like a madman . "
78933	78938	78939	78939	Stephan	618	" I 'm okay ! "
78945	78950	78895	78895	Stephan	618	" I 'm fine ! "
78951	78975	78980	78980	Eileen	551	" Shut up ! You 're not fine ! Eileen , did you hear that ? I 'm afraid he 's got edema . "
78976	78979	78980	78980	Eileen	551	" Yeah , "
78983	78990	78895	78895	Stephan	618	" Has he got a headache ? "
78991	79018	78895	78895	Stephan	618	" No . It 's just his lungs right now , I think . Shut up ! I can hear his chest bubbling , you know . "
79019	79025	78980	78980	Eileen	551	" Yeah . Pulse up ? "
79026	79034	79039	79039	Eileen	551	" Pulse weak and rapid , yeah . "
79035	79038	79039	79039	Eileen	551	" Damn . "
79044	79051	78980	78980	Eileen	551	" Put him on max oxygen . "
79052	79059	78980	78980	Eileen	551	" I already have . Still ... "
79060	79072	79039	79039	Eileen	551	" I know . We 've got to get him down . "
79073	79078	79083	79083	Arthur	491	" I 'm okay ! "
79079	79082	79083	79083	Arthur	491	" Yeah , "
79086	79102	79108	79108	Eileen	551	" He needs to come down , at least to your camp , maybe lower . "
79103	79107	79108	79108	Eileen	551	" Damn it , "
79115	79123	79391	79391	Arthur	491	" I moved him up too fast . "
79378	79390	79391	79391	Arthur	491	" I do n't know how we 'll get him down , "
79395	79413	79391	79391	Arthur	491	" I gave him a small shot of morphine to get the peripheral veins to start dilating . "
79414	79431	79391	79391	Arthur	491	" Good . We 'll just have to truss him into a harness and lower him . "
79432	79442	79796	79796	Hans	619	" Easier said than done , in this stuff . "
79789	79795	79796	79796	Hans	619	" He should be okay , "
79799	79809	79830	79830	Eileen	551	" Wo n't know for sure for several hours . "
79822	79829	80382	80382	Eileen	551	" We 'll go back up , "
80379	80381	81062	81062	Roger	550	" hears "
81078	81082	81229	81229	They	3287	" certifiably bombproof , "
81218	81225	81249	81249	Eileen	551	" That was quite an excursion . "
81260	81275	81321	81321	Eileen	551	" . .. so if the wind stays high enough we should be okay . "
81314	81320	81436	81436	Eileen	551	" Morphine will do that , "
81425	81435	81436	81436	Eileen	551	" Amazing what some people will do for fun , "
81443	81451	81461	81461	Big	583	" This is n't the fun part . "
81452	81460	81471	81471	he	550	" Is n't it ? That climb ... "
81464	81470	81471	81471	he	550	" That was some climb , "
81478	81485	81436	81436	Eileen	551	" That was a great climb . "
81486	81495	81500	81500	She	551	" Especially since we did n't get killed . "
81496	81499	81436	81436	Eileen	551	" Yeah . "
81523	81540	81646	81646	Roger	550	" I hope Stephan gets better . Otherwise , we 'll have to take him down . "
81641	81645	81646	81646	Roger	550	" No hurry , "
81649	81674	81711	81711	he	560	" No one 's going anywhere anyway , and water in the lungs is serious business . You 'll have to take it slow — "
81704	81710	81977	81977	Roger	550	" Pretty invigorating out there , "
81967	81976	81991	81991	he	491	" He certainly seems to be enjoying himself , "
81986	81990	81991	81991	he	491	" That Dougal ! "
81994	82048	82089	82089	Arthur	491	" What a Brit he is . You know climbers are the same everywhere . I come all the way to Mars and find just the people you 'd expect to find on Ben Nevis . ' Course it stands to reason , does n't it ? That New Scotland school and all . "
82081	82088	82215	82215	Roger	550	" And I 'll tell you , "
82092	82214	82228	82228	Stephan	618	" those guys are never happier than when it 's blowing force ten and dumping snow by the dump truck . Or not snow , actually . More like sleet , that 's what they want . One degree rain , or wet snow . Perfect . And you know why they want it ? So they can come back in at the end of the day and say , ' Bloody desperate out today , eh mate ? ' They 're all dying to be able to say that . ' Bluidy ^asperate , mite . ' Ha ! Do you know what I mean ? It 's like giving themselves a medal or something , I do n't know . "
82223	82227	82236	82236	Arthur	491	" Very macho , "
82231	82235	82351	82351	Roger	550	" But Dougal ! "
82239	82349	82351	82351	Roger	550	" Dougal ! He 's too cool for that . He goes out there in the nastiest conditions he can possibly find — I mean look at him just now — he could n't wait to get back out there ! Did n't want to waste such a fine opportunity ! And he climbs the hardest pitches he can find too . Have you seen him ? You 've seen the routes he leaves behind . Man , that guy could climb buttered glass in a hurricane . And what does he say about it ? Does he say that was pretty bloody desperate ? No ! He says , "
82361	82365	82370	82370	Stephan	618	" How invigorating ! "
82366	82369	82370	82370	Stephan	618	" Yeah . "
82373	82381	82387	82387	Arthur	491	" Pretty invigorating out there all right . "

82393	82406	82418	82418	Roger	550	" Martian Scots , no less . I ca n't believe it . "
82407	82417	82418	82418	Roger	550	" It 's not just the Scots are strange , "
82422	82444	82452	82452	Arthur	491	" What about you , Arthur ? I notice you getting quite a giggle out of all this yourself , eh ? "
82445	82451	82452	82452	Arthur	491	" Oh yeah , yeah , "
82455	82633	82634	82634	He	3309	" I 'm having a good time . Are n't you ? I 'll tell you , once we got on the oxygen I started feeling great . Before that it was n't so easy . The air seemed really thin , I mean really Green Mars 161 thin . Elevations here do n't mean anything to me , I mean you have n't got a proper sea level so what does elevation really mean , right ? But your air is like nothing , man . So when we got on the bottle I could really feel the difference . A lifesaver . And then there 's the gravity ! Now that 's wonderful . What is it , two - fifths of a gee ? Practically nothing ! You might as well be on the moon ! As soon as I learned to balance properly , I really started to have a good time . Felt like Superman . On this planet it just is n't that hard to go uphill , that 's all . "
82644	82652	82888	82888	Marie	616	" On Mars , I 'm Superman . "
82897	82975	82985	82985	Arthur	491	" Well , I do n't know what 's going on up there , but with Stephan sucking down the oxygen and you all making centimeters a day we 're going to end up stuck on this damn cliff for good ! What ? I do n't give a fuck what your troubles are , mate — if you ca n't make the lead you should bloody well get down and let somebody on there who can ! "
82976	82984	82985	82985	Arthur	491	" This is a big tuff band , "
82989	83007	83040	83040	Roger	550	" Once we get above this it 's more or less a straight shot to the top — "
83008	83039	83099	83099	she	551	" If you 've got any bloody oxygen it is ! Look what is this , a co - op ? I did n't join a fucking co - op ! "
83103	83111	83099	83099	she	551	" Marie ! Marie ! Eileen here — "
83112	83117	83099	83099	she	551	" I know that . "
83118	83134	83170	83170	Arthur	491	" Arthur and Hans are scheduled to come down soon . Meanwhile , shut up . "
83179	83186	83662	83662	he	550	" So there ! So there ! "
83656	83661	83662	83662	he	550	" Look at that , "
83665	83675	83699	83699	she	551	" You ca n't get away from it anywhere . "
83686	83698	83786	83786	Roger	550	" It 's not the new landscape you hate so much , "
83702	83785	83786	83786	Roger	550	" I saw the way you were looking at that plant . And it 's just a plant after all , doing its best to live . No , I think you 've made a displacement . You use topography as a symbol . It 's not the landscape , it 's the people . It 's the history we 've made that you dislike . The terraforming is just part of it — the visible sign of a history of exploitation . "
83790	83803	83844	83844	Roger	550	" We 're just another Terran colony , you mean . Colonialism — "
83804	83842	83921	83921	she	551	" Yes . That 's what you hate , see ? Not topography , but history . Because the terraforming , so far , is a waste . It 's not being done for any good purpose . "
83883	83919	84110	84110	he	550	" There 's some good in that , if you think about it . Because the landscape is n't going to change back , ever . But history — history must change , by definition . "
84104	84109	84110	84110	he	550	" Want some tea ? "
84113	84116	84137	84137	She	551	" Yeah . "
84117	84124	84137	84137	She	551	" It 'll be a moment . "
84125	84136	84137	84137	She	551	" Hold the stove steady — I've got to pee . "
84162	84178	84194	84194	Eileen	551	" Wow ! Sure is cold out . And clear ! I can see stars . "
84182	84193	84231	84231	he	550	" Great . The wind 's died too , see ? "
84220	84230	84239	84239	she	551	" Do you really not remember us from before ? "
84234	84238	84239	84239	she	551	" Nooo . ... "
84243	84284	84296	84296	Roger	550	" We were in our twenties , right ? No , the first years I really remember are from my fifties , when I was training up in the caldera . Wall climbs , kind of like this , actually . "
84288	84295	84296	84296	Roger	550	" But tell me about us . "
84299	84305	84296	84296	Roger	550	" It does n't matter . "
84306	84320	84296	84296	Roger	550	" It must be odd . To remember when the rest do n't . "
84321	84327	84296	84296	Roger	550	" Yes , it is . "
84328	84337	84353	84353	She	551	" I was probably awful at that age . "
84338	84352	84353	84353	She	551	" No no . You were an English major . You were fine . "
84356	84368	84296	84296	Roger	550	" Hard to believe . Unless I 've gone downhill since . "
84369	84387	84296	84296	Roger	550	" No , not at all . You sure could n't have done all this back then . "
84388	84407	84418	84418	She	551	" I believe that . Getting half an expedition strung out all over a cliff , people sick — "
84408	84417	84418	84418	She	551	" No no . You 're doing fine . "
84423	84439	84296	84296	Roger	550	" You ca n't pretend this climb has gone well . I remember that much . "
84440	84495	84500	84500	They	3340	" What has n't gone well has n't been your fault , as you must admit . In fact , given what has happened , we 're doing very well , I think . And that 's mostly your doing . Not easy with Frances and Stephan , and the storm , and Marie . "
84496	84499	84509	84509	Roger	550	" Marie ! "
84503	84508	84509	84509	Roger	550	" And this storm , "

84529	84536	84547	84547	He	550	" That was a wild one , "
84562	84574	84509	84509	Roger	550	" My God that 's cold ! What 's the temperature ? "
84575	84581	84547	84547	He	550	" Sixty below , outside . "
84582	84599	84629	84629	Roger	550	" Oh . No wonder . I guess that cloud cover was doing us some good . "
84619	84628	84649	84649	He	550	" I like the way you lead us , "
84632	84648	84649	84649	He	550	" It 's a very light touch , but you still have things under control . "
84662	84666	84649	84649	He	550	" More tea ? "
84667	84670	84649	84649	He	550	" Definitely . "
84671	84692	84744	84744	her	3343	" Here — roll back here , you 'll warm up faster , and I could use the insulation myself . "

84780	84783	84793	84793	Roger	550	" Yeah . "
84784	84792	85909	85909	Dougal	560	" Here — move over a bit . "

86006	86015	86035	86035	Roger	550	" I guess the hard part is over , "

86258	86271	86494	86494	Marie	616	" If we get there tonight we can break out the champagne . "
86507	86524	86536	86536	Eileen	551	" It 's a walk up a bloody hill ! And a long walk at that ! "
86525	86535	86536	86536	Eileen	551	" How else are you going to get down ? "
86540	86543	86640	86640	Eileen	551	" Jump ? "
86630	86639	86640	86640	Eileen	551	" You could climb down the cliff alone , "

88830	88874	88888	88888	Roger	657	" The shock could start your edema again , for sure . None of us should do it for long . But for a few minutes , it will go . Just breathe through the mesh face masks , to warm the air . "

100785	101112	101530	101530	people	857	" carried the day and the process proceeded . 1.1.2 The idea of government as jury duty has rarely been enacted , but the theoretical arguments for the idea were interesting enough to inspire the framers to try it . The possibility that any citizen can become a lawmaker has had profoundly positive psychological and social impacts , even though the actual duma in practice has not usually been the driving force in legislative matters — and , yes , sometimes has been a circus , and always has a ( refreshing ) feel of unprofessionalism . But combined with the economic autonomy enjoyed by the ordinary person , this tangible sensation of self - government has raised the concept of citizenship to new heights of responsibility , and given people a stronger sense of the collective that has always existed . 2.1.1 A seven - member executive council is derived from the Swiss system . The aim is to depersonalize the executive functions of government , without rendering them inoperative by giving them over to an entire congressional - sized body . Though political fighting among the council membership is inevitable , votes quickly decide arguments and then the executive branch has decided on a course of action . This is not much different than a council of advisers influencing a single executive . But it does remove the tendency to personalize politics , to 200 THE MARTIANS demonize or valorize individuals when really , in this particular realm of social life , it is policy that matters . The method has worked well in Switzerland , where many well - educated citizens do not know who their president is , but know where they stand on all issues current in the Swiss polity . And the same has proved to be true on Mars . 2.1.2 The Australian ballot system is required so often in the constitution because the framers became convinced that it encourages "
101117	101529	101530	101530	people	857	" by candidates . Voters vote for at least three candidates , placing them first second third and so on , and their first choice gets more points in a weighted system . Candidates are thus encouraged to seek second- and third - place votes from voters outside their own constituency , whatever it might be . On Earth this has worked very well in fractured electorates , healing some profound divisions over time , and given the polyglot nature of Martian society , the framers decided it was appropriate for Mars as well . 3.1.3 The splitting of the global judiciary into two branches was questioned at the constitutional congress , but in the end it was decided that so many questions of environmental law lay at the heart of the Martian experience , that it deserved a special body devoted specifically to regulating that function . People at the time argued that the constitutional court was vestigial and redundant , which has not really proven to be true , as its caseload is always filled with significant problems for Martian society . People also argued that the environmental court would , because of the artificial nature of the Martian biosphere itself , become the most powerful political body on Mars . This has indeed been a much more accurate prediction , and it could be argued that Martian history since the constitution has been the story of how the environmental court has integrated its tremendous power into the rest of social life . But this is not necessarily a bad kind of history to have . 3.2.2 Legislating atmospheric pressure has made the Martian constitution the butt of many jokes , but the Grand Gesture , as it was called , to red considerations , is what allowed the constitution to be completed in the first place . And it does no harm to remind people that the environment on Mars is to a certain extent a matter of human choice . This has been true on Earth as well for almost two centuries , but only since the Great Flood has it been a truth generally acknowledged .

It is the paradox of a free and tolerant society that in order for it to work , intolerance can not be tolerated . The two injunctions "
101534	101536	100756	100756	Charlotte	673	" and "
101543	101701	100756	100756	Charlotte	673	" must exist as a living contradiction or dynamic tension . In practice , local laws that violate the Martian spirit of justice ( as detailed in the constitution ) have stuck out like sore thumbs . 3.3.2 The idea that the constitution should mandate certain kinds of economies was controversial and hotly debated at the constitutional congress , but the argument that prevailed was unassailable : Economics is politics , and a just political existence , a just life , depends on a just economic system . This being the case , the framers were not free to ignore this issue , or all their efforts would have been rendered a kind of huge gesture or joke in the face of history . As it turns out , the establishment of a democratic participatory economy has been complicated and fraught with problems and argument , but not vicious or even particularly divisive . The old argument that "
101704	101833	101530	101530	people	857	" could never behave in anything but a feudal economic hierarchal manner disappeared like a mist the moment people were enfranchised in their work , and the capital created by generations of labor turned over to the ownership of the collective , and run by the people who operate it . Hierarchies still exist within each social structure , but in a context of general equality they are seen as the result of work , experience , and age rather than unearned privilege , and so they do not engender the same resentments . In other words , people are still people ; argue , resent , hate , are selfish , will share only with kin or those they know , if that is what you mean by "
101836	101913	101530	101530	people	857	" ; but are now in an economic framework where they are roughly equal to those they despise , and can not grossly oppress or be oppressed by them , financially . This takes the sting out of anger at others , believe me . But you have to have lived under the old regime fully to feel the difference . 3.4.1 This provision provoked much hilarity during the constitutional convention , as being an afterthought body "
101916	102539	101530	101530	people	857	" profound contradictions in the judiciary and government as designed ; it was even predicted that the whole government would eventually be run by this tacked - on reconciliation board . 202 THE MARTIANS Indeed this has sometimes proved to be the case . What has to be remembered is that this is not necessarily a bad thing . The fulcrum of government should be in the courts , rather than in , say , army headquarters . I have never found the debates before the reconciliation board to be anything less than fascinating : the whole philosophy of government and human nature , squabbled over in every nit - picking bureaucratic detail . Of course you may say , But this is your job , Charlotte , you like this kind of thing . But I would reply by pointing out how many people are like me , nowadays , and very much enjoy their work ; which is no longer time that you give to others to earn the money to do what you want , but actually something you have chosen because you find it interesting ( if you are sensible ) , because you are fully involved in the results of the work , and are recompensed for it in much the same ways and to the same degree as everyone else in the world , with sufficiency at least , and usually much more : This is the situation that the society based on this constitution has managed to achieve . That 's what I find so interesting about it , you see . 4.2 Again , the great paradox : intolerance of intolerance . But how else can justice be achieved ? 4.4 This clause was clearly included to try to drive Martian politics down to the local and up to the global , effectively abolishing anything like the nation - states of Earth . Whether the nation - state was actually the source of Earth 's terrible problems is arguable , but no one could see why there should be any nations on Mars , and so the clause passed . No one has missed the nation - state here , and indeed when you look at the word patriotism you can see that it is not a concept Mars need concern itself with . 4.5 Making war unconstitutional ; this too was laughed at by many at the convention , but passed nevertheless . Perhaps you ca n't mandate goodness , but it may be worth trying anyway . 5.1.9 While controversial , this clause alone has been a major force in the struggle for equality and justice on Mars . 5.2.1 This practice was also taken from the Swiss , modified to demilitarize it and make it a matter of public work for the collective wellbeing of Martian society . The usual pattern has become six months after secondary education , three three - month sessions in the four Some Worknotes and Commentary on the Constitution 203 years immediately after that , and nine more months on an occasional basis in the years after that . Thus the bulk of public service is done by the young and is part of their education . One study showed that over thirty percent of Martian couples met their partners during their publicservice time , so if nothing else it works as mixer and matchmaker . 5.2.2 This clause encountered surprisingly little resistance at the convention . A no - brainer , Art called it . 6 Treatment of the land is fundamental to any government concerned with permaculture , that is , with stewardship of the biosphere for the good of future generations . Society is "
102570	102696	101530	101530	people	857	" ( Edmund Burke . ) And so we must care for the land . 7 There have been fourteen amendments passed in the twenty myears the constitution has been law . Most reconcile contradictions embedded in the constitution , or in the local / global or tolerance situations , or refine the terraforming laws to meet current conditions . 8 Passed October 11 , m - year 52 , by 78 % to 22 % . Now operating successfully for twenty - one m - years . At this point I believe the constitution can be judged a success . Those who argued at the time that a constitution was itself anachronistic and unnecessary did not understand its function : not to be a static "
102699	102908	103528	103528	you	4012	" wherein all social contradiction was resolved forever , but rather to be a template to structure argument , and a spur to justice . Despite the difficulties encountered since with enacting the vaguer or more radical sections of the document , I believe it has , like its great American and Swiss predecessors , succeeded in this sense . The form of government mandated by this constitution can be called polyarchy ; power is distributed out through a great number of institutions and individuals , in a web of checks and balances that reduces any possibilities of oppressive hierarchy . The goals of the constitution , listed in the preamble , come down to justice and peaceful dissent . Where those have been created , all else will follow . Of course the constitution has somewhat receded into the background now , as huge masses of legislation and informal practice have accreted around it , regulating the day - to - day activities of most Martians . But that was its function to begin with and not to be lamented . 204 THE MARTIANS The constitution was , to my mind , written to give people a sense that their management of their affairs was in no way "
102910	103525	103542	103542	I	0	" or written in stone ; laws and governments have always been artificial inventions , practices , and habits . They can change , they have changed , they will change again . That being the case , there is no reason not to try to change them for the better . And that is what we did . What the result will be in the long run no one can say . But I think it has been a good beginning . Jackie on Zo 4 It did n't seem that bad to me but I had an epidural so what do I know . It was like an extremely arduous athletic effort that I could n't choose not to do . I 've seen people 's scornful looks when I mention the epidural , but I say we 're Terran animals and if we 're going to give birth on another planet we deserve a little medical intervention . To insist on a natural childbirth on Mars is a kind of machismo I 'm not interested in . She was hard from the start . She was pulled out of me and put on my chest and I saw this little red face looking me right in the eye and yelling in protest . She was pissed off , you could read that on her face just as clear as on anyone older than her . I doubt not that we 're conscious in the womb , for at least the last part of the confinement , lost in thought without language , like music or meditation . And so we come out with our character already in place , intact and complete . Nothing afterward changes it . And in fact she was pissed off like that for years to come . She sucked voraciously , cried inconsolably , slept fitfully , shrieked in her sleep as if fully awake — then woke up terrified by her own noise and cried some more . I often wondered what she dreamed about to scare her so . For thousands of years they 've called it colic and no one knows what it is . Some say it 's the slow adjustment of the digestive system to the barrage of new chemicals . From the writhing of her torso I judge there is some truth to that . But I also think she was still pissed off about being ejected from the womb . Rage at the unfair loss of that narcissistic oceanic bliss . She remembered the 206 THE MARTIANS womb . Even later when she forgot she remembered , and did everything she could to get back to that place . That 's Zo 's whole story really . The colic drove me crazy . I could n't comfort her and could n't get her to stop crying . Nothing worked , and believe me I tried everything I could think of , because it exasperated me no end . Sometimes she cried ten hours straight . That 's a long time when a baby 's crying . The only thing that worked even a little was to hold her in my hands , one under her butt and one behind her head and neck , and raise her up and down rapidly , as if she were in a swing . This boggled her into silence and she even seemed to like it , or at least be interested . In any case she would stop crying . But one time when I was doing it an Arab woman came up to me and put her hand out and said , "
103540	103541	103542	103542	I	0	" "
103549	103558	103542	103542	I	0	" I told her , and showed her . "
103567	103578	103586	103586	I	0	" She was nervous , even scared , but persisting . "
103590	104013	104020	104020	her	675	" But I never did it again . And I thought later about the kind of courage it takes to remonstrate with a stranger about his or her parenting . If Michel 's belief in the theory of the four temperaments is correct , which I doubt , then she was choleric . Moody — like Maya , yes , she was . This similarity did n't bother me as much as people might think . I liked Maya a lot more than she liked me — who would n't , she 's like something out of Sophocles — but she wanted to fight , and I was n't going to back down . It was the same with Zo . It 's all a matter of one 's biochemistry — one 's moods I mean . That 's what Michel was saying too really , with all his biological correlations . The four temperaments , sure , except there are forty , or forty thousand . Grouped perhaps loosely in his four , who knows . Anyway Zo was a choleric 's choleric , the pure product . She was extremely frustrated throughout her first year , when she could n't talk or walk . She could see all the rest of us doing those things and she wanted to too . She tipped over a million times , like a top - heavy doll . I kept a supply of butterfly Band - Aids on hand , in fact a complete little medical kit . She babbled authoritatively at everyone , but when they failed to understand her she got furious . She grabbed things out of your hand . She threw her cups and spoons and dishes at you , or on the floor . She would take big swings at you , and was so fast that some of them landed . She would head - butt you with the back of her head — she split my lip twice , but after that my face got faster Jackie on Zo 207 than her head . Which made her furious . She would throw herself headlong on the floor and beat the ground with fists and feet , and howl . It was hard not to laugh at such histrionics , but I usually avoided letting her see me laugh , as it drove her berserk and her face would go an alarming purple color . So I tried to be noncommittal . It got easy to ignore . "
104023	104028	104020	104020	her	675	" I would say . "
104054	104728	104020	104020	her	675	" When she learned to walk she got less cranky . She learned to feed herself too , very quickly . She refused high chairs or boosters or any baby utensils as affronts to her dignity . Once she could get around she was a danger to herself even more than before . She would eat anything . Changing her diapers , I found sand , dirt , pebbles , roots , twigs , small toys , little household objects — it was a real mess . And she would fight like crazy while you tried to change her . Not always , but about half the time . It was like that with all the daily routine — changing clothes , brushing teeth , getting in the bath , getting out of the bath — half the time she would cooperate , half she would object and fight you all the way . And if you let her win it only got worse next time . Give a centimeter and she would go for the kilometer . I suppose eating dirt might have been how she got sick . She got some variant of the Guillain - Barre virus , but we did n't know that at the time , we only saw the forty - degree temperature and then she was paralyzed completely , for six days . I could n't believe it . I was still in the full shock of it happening when she came out of it and started to move again — first twitches , then everything . It was an amazing relief . But I have to admit that after that she was worse than ever . Her tantrums would last an hour , and if you put her in a room by herself she would do her best to destroy it . She broke bones in both hands . So you had to stay in the room to watch her . I seriously considered making it a padded room . She was also terrible to other kids . She would walk right up to them and knock them down , almost as if experimentally . It was impersonal , and she did n't seem malicious — more like deranged . And indeed later we figured out that she had a perceptual problem after her illness , and thought she was farther away from things than she really was . So when she got interested in another person , bam , over they went . She was a cheery little anarchist in her day care , so highmaintenance I was embarrassed to inflict her on the place . But I needed to work and I needed time away from her , so I did it anyway . They did n't complain , not directly . 208 THE MARTIANS The more she learned to talk the more she challenged the rules . NO was her first word and her favorite for years . She said it with immense conviction . The trick questions got the biggest NOs of all . Will you get out of the bath ? No . Do n't you want to get to read a book ? No . Do n't you want to have dessert ? No . Do you like to say no ? NO . She picked up language so fast I could n't really remember how it happened . For a few months it was just a few words , then all of a sudden she could say whatever she wanted . That made her more relaxed in some ways . Her good moods were really good , and lasted longer . She was so cute you could hardly stand it . It has to be some kind of evolutionary mechanism to keep you from killing them . She was always on the move , jumping around , looking to do something or go somewhere . She developed a passion for trams and trucks , and would cry out , "
104731	104733	104020	104020	her	675	" or "
104736	104751	104020	104020	her	675	" Once I was out by myself and I saw a truck and said , "
104757	104823	104830	104830	I	0	" and the people sitting around me on the tram looked at me . But she still had a hell of a temper . And now when she got mad she would chew you out as well as hit you and throw things at you . You had to laugh at how basic she was . She said the meanest things she could think of . "
104828	104829	104830	104830	I	0	" "
104836	104837	104838	104838	You	0	" "

104885	104909	104910	104910	I	0	" In public this could be embarrassing . Often when I took her out she would look at someone nearby and announce loudly , "
104917	104922	104869	104869	I	0	" And sometimes add , "
104927	104928	104869	104869	I	0	" "
104933	104953	104869	104869	I	0	" I would say , with an apologetic look , trying to convey that she did this to everyone . "
104959	105139	105654	105654	I	0	" After that infancy when she hit the so - called terrible twos it was kind of hard to tell the difference . Though it did get worse in some ways . At times it was almost impossible to deal with her . It was like living with a psychotic . Every day was a complete roller coaster , with several great highs and just as many shrieking tantrums . Everything you told her to do she would stop and decide whether she wanted to obey or not , and usually the very idea of being told what to do would offend her , and she would opt for defiance just on principle . Often she would do the opposite of what she was told to do . I had to be ready for that or it was trouble . I had to decide whether it was worth it to tell her not to do something — if it really mattered . If it did then I had to be prepared for the whole melodrama . Once I said , "
105151	105653	105663	105663	Zo	675	" and she slammed it down before I could get to her and it broke the mug and the tabletop , which was glass . She Jackie on Zo 209 was round - eyed but unrepentant . Angry at me , as if I had tricked her . She also wanted to break a few more to see how it worked . All these intensities were constant and across the board , and so she could be a joy when she was in a good mood . We explored Mars like John in the beginning . I never felt more strongly that I was in the presence of mental brilliance than when I was with her , out walking together on the moors or in the streets of a town , when she was about three — not even with Sax or Vlad or Bao Shuyo . The sense that here was someone intently observing the world and then putting things together faster than I could ever dream of doing . She laughed at things all the time , often for reasons I could n't see , and when she laughed she was so beautiful . At all times she was an exceptionally good - looking child , but when she laughed there was a physical beauty that along with the innocence was heart - stopping to see . How we manage to ruin that quality is humanity 's great crime , repeated over and over . Anyway , that beauty and laughter made all the temper tantrums a lot easier for me , sure . You could n't help but love her , she was so passionate . When she blew up and hit the deck screaming and pounding and thrashing on the floor I would think , Oh well , that 's just Zo . No need to take it personally . Not even the I hate you Moms — they were n't personal either , not really . It was just she was passionate . I loved her so much . Which only made it worse seeing Nirgal . What a contrast — week after week taking care of Zo , exhausted a lot of the time , and then he would drop by , just as airy and vague and agreeable as ever — everyone 's friend , mild and somewhat removed . Like Hiroko a bit . And yes he was Zo 's father , I admit it now , but who could imagine that she had anything to do with him , so blithe and smooth he was , all his life . He may be the Great Martian , everyone seems to think so , but he was nothing to her I tell you . One time he came by and everyone was fawning over him as usual , drawn to him as if to some kind of magic mirror , and Zo took one look at him and turned to me and said , "
105661	105662	105663	105663	Zo	675	" "
105665	105672	105679	105679	Zo	675	" A daring glance at him : "
105677	105678	105691	105691	She	4020	" "
105684	105690	105691	105691	She	4020	" I looked at him . "
105697	105722	105730	105730	she	4020	" Immediately she ran to Charlotte and hugged her legs , glancing at me . Everyone laughed and she glowered , not expecting that . "
105725	105729	105776	105776	I	0	" I said , "
105754	105775	105785	105785	Zo	675	" 210 THE MARTIANS Nirgal nodded and smiled at her , but he still looked startled when she loudly insisted , “
105783	105784	105785	105785	Zo	675	" “
105793	106601	105785	105785	Zo	675	" And eventually , I mean over years , she did get a bit more polite . Eventually the world wears you down , you get a veneer of civilization over your real self . But how I loved her when she was a little animal and you saw just what she was really like . How I loved her . These days we get together for lunch and she is the most arrogant supercilious young woman you can imagine , completely full of herself , condescending to me from an enormous height , and I just look at her and laugh , thinking , You think you 're so tough - you should have seen yourself when you were two . Keeping tlie Flame Once during one of his long runs across the land , after he had given up looking for Hiroko but before he had stopped the movement of the search , Nirgal crossed the great dark forest of Cimmeria , south of Elysium . In the forest it was slow going . The trees were tall fir and linden trees , with a dense understory of Hokkaido pine and birch . The sun lanced through the thick roof of the canopy in bright pencils of light , which struck pads of dark moss , curled ferns , wild onions , and mats of electric green lichen . In those shadows and through the myriad parallel shafts of buttery light he ran slowly for day after day , lost but unconcerned , as a general western push would eventually lead him out of the forest to some point on the Great Canal . The forest silence was broken only by the chirps of birds , the deep soughing chorus of wind in the pine needles above , and twice the distant yodeling of coyotes , or wolves . Once something big that he never saw crashed away through brush . He had been running for sixty days straight . Low crater rings were the only relief , all softened and buried under trees , leaf mats , humus , and rocky carpets of moss . Most of the craters were rimless , so that jogging along he would come on the arc of a sunken round room , and through branches spy a little round meadow , or a shallow round lake , infilling with meadow from the sides . Usually he circled them and continued on his way . But in one little sunken meadow there stood the ruins of a white - stone temple . He dropped down the gentle slope of the depression , approached at a walk , feeling hesitant . The stone of the temple was alabaster , and 212 THE MARTIANS very white . It reminded him of the white - stone village in Medusa Fossa . It looked Greek , though it was round . Twelve slender white Ionic pillars , made of stacked drums of stone , set around the flat base like the points of a clock . No roof , which made it look even more like a Greek ruin , or a British henge . Lichen was growing in the cracks of its base . Nirgal walked around and through it , suddenly aware of the silence . There was no wind , no sound of bird or beast . All was in shadow ; the world had stopped . Apollo might step out of the gloom . Something reminded him of Zygote ; perhaps simply the white of the columns , somewhat like Zygote 's dome , back there in his past which now seemed to him like a fairy tale from another age , a tale with a child hero and an animal mother . The notion that that fairy tale and the moment he lived in were parts of the same life — his life — it took a leap of faith that he was incapable of making . Hard to imagine how it would feel a century or two on , in other words what it felt like now for Nadia and Maya and the rest of the issei .... Something moved and he jumped . But it was nothing . He shook his head , touched the smooth cool surface of a column . A human mark in the forest . Human marks , both temple and forest . In this ancient eroded crater . Two old people appeared across the clearing , walking to the temple , unaware of Nirgal . His heart leaped in him like a child trying to escape — But they were strangers . He had never seen them before . Old men ; Caucasian ; bald ; wrinkled ; one short , the other shorter . Both now looking at him suspiciously . "
106604	106623	105785	105785	Zo	675	" he said . They approached , one pointing a dart gun at the ground . He said , "
106629	106641	106644	106644	you	4026	" One stopped , held the other back by the arm . "
106647	106657	106671	106671	We	4027	" Nirgal nodded . They glanced at each other . "
106664	106670	106671	106671	We	4027	" the same one said . "
106677	106866	106671	106671	We	4027	" They hiked up through the woods covering the old crater wall , to the edge of the crater , where stood a little cottage , constructed of logs , roofed by dark red slates . The men led Nirgal into this home of theirs , Nirgal ducking under the lintel . It was dim inside . One window overlooked the crater . The tops of the monument 's pillars were visible in the treetops . Keeping the Flame 213 They served Nirgal an odd herb tea , made from a kind of pond weed . They were issei , they said — not only issei , but members of the First Hundred . Edvard Perrin and George Berkovic . Edvard did most of the talking . Friends , they were . And colleagues of Phyllis Boyle . The monument in the crater was a memorial to her . The three of them had built a similar structure long ago , out of ice drums , for fun . On the first trip to the North Pole , with Nadia and Ann , in m - year 2 . "
106871	106916	106973	106973	they	4030	" George added with a flinty smile . They told him their story , and he saw it had once been oft - repeated . Edvard told most of it , with George adding comments , or finishing some of Edvard 's trailing sentences . "

They had survived ' 61 , they had worked for peace in the years between revolutions , helping UNTA in Burroughs to coordinate mining efforts in Vastitas , sequencing them so that sites in danger of inundation by the north sea were strip - mined with enormous speed before the ice and water buried them . Those were the glory years , a moment in history when the tremendous power of technology could be wielded on the landscape without consequences — no environmental impact statements , no scars that would last . . . billions of dollars of metals extracted before the ice overwhelmed the sites .

108081	109447	108077	108077	I	0	" Nirgal considered it . These were two of only a few , maybe a half dozen , of the First Hundred who had sided with the UNTA all the way . Would Hiroko reveal herself to them ? Would she try to hide from them ? If they knew of her presence , would they tell him ? But they did n't know . He sat there in the big comfortable armchair , falling asleep . There was nothing to know . Around him the two wizened old men moved quietly about the dim room . Old turtleheads , deep in their dark cave . But they had loved Phyllis . Both of them . As friends . Or maybe it had n't been like that . Maybe it had n't been that simple . However it had happened , they were the partners now . Maybe they had always been the partners . In the First Hundred that might have been a difficulty . Phyllis of course seemed an unlikely refuge . All the better perhaps . Who knew what had happened in the beginning . The past was a mystery . Even to those who had been there and lived it . And of course even at the 216 THE MARTIANS time none of it had made sense , not the kind of sense people talked about afterward . Now they puttered about in the dusk . He felt the exhaustion of his long run take hold of him . Let him sleep . We should tell him . No . Why not ? There 's no need . Everyone will find out soon enough . When things start dying . Phyllis would n't have wanted that . But they killed her . So they do n't have her here to save them . So they get what they deserve ? Everything dying ? Everything wo n't die . It will if it works the way they want . She would n't have wanted that . We had no choice . You know that . They would have killed us . Would they ? I 'm not so sure . I think you wanted it . They kill Phyllis , and so we — We had no choice I say ! Come on . They could have gotten the locations from the records . And who 's to say they are n't right anyway . Revenge . Okay , revenge . Say it was . Serves them right . This was never their planet . Much later Nirgal found himself suddenly awake , and cold . Neck sore from being bent in the big armchair . The old men were slumped at the kitchen table over books , as still as wax figurines . One of them was asleep , dreaming the other 's dream . The other watched it in the air . Their fire had banked to gray coals . Nirgal whispered that he had to leave . He got up and walked out into a frigid predawn , walked for a while and then ran again through the dark trees , running as if to escape something . Saving Noctis Dam 4 The Noctis Dam was not a good idea in any case , and then unfortunately they botched the engineering as well . They placed the dam in the mouth of the southernmost Noctis canyon , where the rim is a basalt cap resting on old sandstone . Naturally as soon as the reservoir filled the sandstone began to saturate , which weakened the dam foundations . Then the only emergency runoff as designed was a big glory hole that ran water down through a tunnel in the rock on the side , letting it out into the headwaters of the Ius River below . They lined the tunnel with concrete , of course , but it was sandstone behind that . Thus when the weather became more violent and we saw the first superstorms , the dam was not designed to handle such runoffs . The reservoir level would rise very fast . One of the very first times that happened I was there to see it , and it was a daunting thing to witness . We opened the glory hole the moment rain was forecast , but it seemed to make little difference . And this time the rock behind the concrete was so weakened by seepage that the cavitation ripped the concrete right out of there , apparently . All the instrument readings for the tunnel went dead , and then we saw the concrete being shot out of the hole at the bottom into the shallows of the headwaters ; sometimes after a minute or two of complete blockage , so that housesized chunks of concrete went flying hundreds of meters , as out of a cannon . A very disturbing sight for all of us . Of course the water going down the tunnel would immediately begin to rip the sandstone out of the hole , and soon enough there 218 THE MARTIANS would be no rim underneath us left to hold up the south side of the dam . Thus we had no choice but to close the glory hole from the top ; indeed we were happy that the option still existed . But after that we had no other way to release water from the reservoir . And it was still raining harder than we had ever seen , as if the clouds had been seeded ; and Noctis Labyrinthus is an extremely big watershed , even just the southernmost quadrant of it , which was what drained into the reservoir . So the reservoir level rose , two meters in an hour , then three . At that rate we had only a few more hours before it reached the top of the dam and started pouring over , and then inevitably the top would tear somewhere , and without further ado the entire dam , all 330 vertical meters of it , would peel down , probably in a single collapse . The rim walls just behind the dam were very likely to go as well . More importantly , the resulting flood would certainly sweep away all the canyon - floor settlements in Oudemans Crater and upper Marineris , perhaps all the way down to Melas Chasma . For some time after we closed the glory hole we were at a loss concerning what next to do . Mary of course called emergency services in Cairo , and told them to warn the people down in Oudemans and in Ius Chasma to get out of the crater and canyon , or at least as high on their walls as they could , as there was no quick way for great numbers of people to get out of that deep crater and gorge . But beyond that it was not clear what we could do . We hastened back and forth between the command center and the dam , looking at the water rising , then walking back up to the command center to check the weather reports , all the while in a terrific downpour . The reports gave us reason to hope that the rain might soon stop — it already had upstream in the watershed , and farther west . And the last squall had consisted mostly of hail — hail the size of oranges , which drove us to the shelter of the center , but had the advantage of staying where it was on the ground upstream , at least until it melted . So that too gave us some hope . Nevertheless , the upstream flow readings coming in to the center made it clear that the lake was going to rise higher than the dam , by what the AI said would be two or three meters . Some rough calculations led me to the conclusion that the overflow would probably be more than the lip of the dam could tolerate . I informed the others of this unhappy conclusion . "
109451	109488	108077	108077	I	0	" Mary said at last , and expressed the wish that the dam were just four meters higher . Certainly that would have helped . Saving Noctis Dam 219 Without really considering it , I said , "
109498	109502	108077	108077	I	0	" They said , "
109507	109508	108077	108077	I	0	" "
109511	109515	110158	110158	God	636	" I said , "
109536	110156	110160	110160	Stephan	618	" This they found amusing , nevertheless we got in the truck and drove wildly to Cairo Lumber over a road sheeted with big hail balls , and we bought their entire stock of plywood sheets . We were too nervous to tell them what we wanted it for . Back at the dam we set up the plywood sheets against the railing , nail - gunning them to the plastic footing of the rail just to keep the wind from blowing them away before the water trapped them against the railing . It started to rain again while we did this . We worked at the highest speed we could manage , I assure you — never have I worked with such a sense of haste . Even so , by the time we finished our work , the water had lipped over the concrete , and we had to run back along the road on the top of the dam splashing ankle deep through the water — an awful experience . Once off the dam and up the road toward the command center , we stopped to look back . If the plywood did not hold and the dam gave way , the rim there would very likely go too , and we would all be killed ; nevertheless , we stopped to look back . We could not help it . The last squall had passed while we labored , and the sky had gone wild over our heads : dark orange to the east , then both to north and south an intense turquoise , like no sky color we had ever seen . It was still black to the west , but the sun was peeping under a distant cloud , illuminating the scene in brassy horizontal light . Below us we saw that the lake was continuing to rise , up the sides of the plywood . Finally , as dusk fell , it was quite a bit more than halfway up the plywood sheets . When we could n't see it very well anymore — and I did n't want to see it either , I confess , it looked so flimsy — we walked back to the command center . Up there we waited . Very possibly the whole structure would go very quickly ; we would see this on the instrumentation , then perhaps be taken along with it , swept down with the rim walls . So all night we watched the readouts on the computers . Meanwhile we told people over the phone what we had done . My throat stayed dry no matter how hard I swallowed . We occupied ourselves telling jokes — a specialty of mine , but never had people laughed so hard at my jokes before . After one Mary hugged me , and I felt she was shaking ; and I saw my hands too were shaking . 220 THE MARTIANS In the morning the water was still flush against the plywood , but it did not seem so high . It seemed it was going to hold . It remained a frightening sight , however ; the lake surface was simply too high , as in some optical illusion ; yet undeniably there below us , spread vast and colorful in the morning light . So the dam held . But our celebration , after pumps arrived and we slowly lowered the water level back below the top of the dam , was muted , almost stunned . We too were drained , so to speak . Looking at the wet curve of plywood sheets topping the dam , Mary said , "
110170	110469	110160	110160	Stephan	618	" Later of course they took it out . I can not say I regret it . Big Man in Love When Big Man fell in love with a human woman , it was big trouble . Her name was Zoya . Yes , she had the same first name as Zo Boone — she was a clone of Zo 's , in fact , cloned by Zo 's friends after Zo 's fatal accident . So genetically Zoya was another daughter of John Boone himself . That was n't all ; because Zo 's body had floated for a while in the north sea , she had been slightly salted , and thereby became inadvertently related to the resurgent archaea . And in that salty fizzing primeval soup of a sea it seems she also picked up traits of kelp and limpet , dolphin and sea otter , and who knows what else . So she was a lot of things — big like Paul Bunyan , wild like Zo , rebellious like the archaea , happy like John , and as stormy and tempestuous as the northern sea . That was Zoya ; Zoya was everything . She swam through icebergs , and flew in the jet stream , and ran the round - the - worlder for an afternoon jog . She drank and she smoked and she took strange drugs , she had casual sex with strangers and even with friends , and she skipped work anytime the waves were big . In short , she was a thrill seeker ; she was a disgrace to propriety and morality ; she mocked all principles of human progress . She could kill with a glance or a palm punch to the nose . Her motto was “
110475	112020	110158	110158	God	636	" Thus when Big Man dropped by Mars one day , and saw Zoya out surfing the hundred - meter waves of the Polar Peninsula , it was love at first sight . This was his kind of woman ! And Zoya proved agreeable . She liked big men , and Big Man was a big man . So they played around Mars together , Big Man stepping 222 THE MARTIANS carefully in his old footsteps to avoid wreaking any new havoc , and trying hard not to get tangled in things . But he could n't help it . They gamboled along the Ius Ridge Trail , and his tiptoeing is what brought down all those cliffs ten years ago . He went swimming with Zoya and that 's what flooded Boone 's Neck peninsula , even though he only went in knee deep . He flew in the jet stream with her and his shadow caused the first year without a summer . They did n't notice any of that ; they were having too much fun together . They even tried to have sex together . Zoya would climb into Big Man 's ears and fool around , and afterward he would hold her in the palm of his hand and moan like King Kong with Fay Wray , you know , Come on , baby , please let 's make love , make love with me , and she would just laugh and point down at his erection and say , Sorry , Big Man . I 'd like to but you wo n't fit . Why it 'd take me all day just to climb that willful tower , it 'd be as hard as climbing Dishes in the Sink or the Other Old Man of Hoy . And to show him she even tried a little of that too , free - climbing to the overhang and massaging what she could reach . But to Big Man it felt like he was being pinched by an ant . Too bad , she would say , going for a swim . Best I can do . But I got ta , moaned Big Man , I wanna , I hafta , I needta , the usual line , familiar to guys and gals everywhere . But this time there was nothing to be done . Sorry , Zoya would say . No can do . If only you were smaller . Then one time , looking a bit flushed and frustrated herself , she said , Look , it 's a matter of will . If only you were smaller we 'd be fine ! I 'd ride you all night . Maybe you should look into getting yourself a smaller cock . What ? Big Man cried . What do you mean ? I mean a smaller cock . You know , get a transplant . Have that one cut off and a smaller one sewn on in its place . A smaller one ? Cut off ? That 's what the situation calls for , big guy . That 's what will have to happen for us to work out . What ? What ? Transplant ! Transplant ! You can get one wherever you get organ transplants . Hospitals , right ? No way , said Big Man . For one thing — and there 's a lot more than one here — transplanted organs come from cadavers . You could get your own cultured and grown to a smaller size . They do stuff like that now . Big Man in Love 223 Oh please , Big Man said . It makes me queasy just talking about this stuff . Not my fault , Zoya said . Where there 's a will there 's a way . And she went out flying by herself . Well , you know . Life was no fun anymore . Eventually Big Man got desperate . He got so desperate that he very surreptitiously began looking into the matter , going to a clinic and telling the people there a clever story about a friend of his who had a very small fiancee . And he found out that the latest in what people called starfish biotechnology was indeed up to the task as described . He could have his private parts surgically removed and replaced by a cultured replacement grown from cells of the original . Cells from its most sensitive part , one doctor assured him . A two - magnitude reduction done twice would make him about right for Zoya . Peace of mind left Big Man . He was cast on the horns of a dilemma , one big one small . This is horrible ! he said . This is ridiculous ! I will not do this . I will forget her . He left the cosmetic urology clinic and did not return . But the fact of the matter is that Big Man was in love , and Big Man 's love was a big love . And love is a big thing ; a very willful thing . And a life without love is a sad thing . And a life without Zoya was dull beyond belief . So finally one day Big Man said , All right all right all right , and dragged back to the clinic to let them take some cells from the most sensitive spot . It hurt a lot . After that he went out to the Oort cloud to commune with himself . We 'll draw a curtain on that scene and let him have some private time , and only say that when he came back , looking tired and apprehensive , he declared himself ready . And Zoya held his hand while they administered several liters of general anesthetic to him , and performed the operation , and when he came to he had private parts twice two magnitudes smaller than before . Ridiculous , he said . As a tribute to his courage Zoya had his old organ chemically petrified and airlifted out to the Hellespontus , where it was placed next to the rock tower called Dishes in the Sink . It has since become a popular climbing tower , as you know , sporting scores of routes up it . And after all the stitches had dissolved and Big Man was physically healed , Zoya took him up to the shores of Chryse Gulf , in midsummer , to a favorite beach of hers , an empty strand on a lost bay . Will you love me now ? Big Man asked her . 224 THE MARTIANS I will , Zoya said . Here again we will draw a curtain and give them some privacy . Suffice it to say that when they came back south , Big Man was light on his feet for the first time ; he was walking ten meters off the ground . He had n't known it could be so good . Later on Zoya left him and broke his heart , unfortunately , and he had to get used to that , as well as to his organ being just a sweet little thing between his legs . It was kind of strange , but not really bad . It meant that when he met other human women he liked , he was sometimes able to form quite satisfactory relationships with them . And occasionally he would run into Zoya , and sometimes they would renew their old affair , with considerable passion . So that all in all , in the long run , looking at everything that had happened since and putting it all in the balance , he judged that it had been worth it . And the climbers on Mars continue to appreciate the decision as well . fin Argument for the Deployment of mi Safe Terraforming Technologies i — — — ■ * The Oxia River runs heavy with silt after storms on Margaritifer Terra , and the muddy water pours through the sandbars at the river 's mouth and stains Chryse Gulf as red as blood , in a bloom extending three or four kilometers out toward the archipelago on the horizon . When the flow recedes , and the silt settles to the bottom , the river 's channel is almost always changed . The mouth might have moved all the way to the other end of the beach . The old channel then silts up , its underwater banks continuing to serve as point breaks for incoming waves , until the waves wear them down . It 's all new , week by week , storm by storm — except for the elements involved , of course : sun , sea , sky ; the bluffs nosing out into the sea , the river canyon between them ; the river 's final beach - dammed lagoon , the dunes , the river water rippling out the break and over the tide bars to slide under the waves of the shorebreak . These are always there . "
112022	112236	110158	110158	God	636	" in the relative sense , of course . I mean that for years it had been this way . But on Mars the landscape is a matter of perpetual change . Punctuated equilibrium , as Sax once said , without the equilibrium . And the cooling of the 2210s , the years without summer , was such that if something were not done , this river - mouth scene would not exist like this for many more years . But the methods that seemed to contain any hope of stopping the trend sounded drastic indeed . For someone who loves the land , the idea of a million thermonuclear explosions in the deep regolith is a shocking thing , an ugly thing . You can make all the arguments you like about the containment of radiation , about the essential heat 226 THE MARTIANS from below , even about the disposal of old Terran weapons , and still it does n't seem like something an environmentalist should approve . And it did n't help that there were advocates using the stupidest language possible to argue for the various heavy - industrial methods being proposed . These were people who did not understand the power of language . They would speak casually of a "
112239	112837	110158	110158	God	636	" for Mars , as if this phrase did not come from a determinate moment in American history , a moment inextricably tied to imperialist wars of conquest , to idiot yahoo patriotism , and to a genocide that most Americans still did not like to admit had occurred . So that to use that horrible old phrase to describe the rescue of the Martian biosphere was insane ; but some people did it anyway . And other people , like Irishka , were extremely put off by it . And all because of words . I sat through the whole of that session of the global environmental court , listening to the arguments pro and con , and though my work is in words I thought to myself , This is absurd , this is horrible . Language is nothing but a huge set of false analogies . There has to be a better way to make one 's point . So when the session was over I got Irishka and her partner Freya to come with me , and we took the equatorial piste west to Ares Fjord , then drove northwest up the shore of Chryse Gulf to the gravel road that went out to Soochow Point , above the Oxia River 's broad beach of a mouth . Early one summer morning we drove around a turn in the sea - cliff road , and all was clear . The horizon was a clean line between sea and sky . Both were blue : the sky a very dark blue with purplish tinges , as if there were a red shell above the blue one ; the sea a blue almost black , its water on this day transparent to a great depth . The land was the usual red rock , though here tinted blackish , as it tended to be through the region , darkening as you move east toward black Syrtis . There was no wind , and the stillness of the water was such that the waves broke as in a wave tank in a physics class , peeling cleanly across their breaks , purring in , leaving white tapestries fizzing behind them , until the shorebreak foamed up the wet red strand . I saw right away that the bottom had changed again in the most recent storm . There was a new point break off to the far left side of the beach . And this offshore sandbar was angled perfectly to the morning 's incoming swell , which was fairly big . Probably there was a hard wind blowing down Kasei 's great canyon and fjord on the other side of Chryse Gulf , creating these waves some thirteen hundred kilometers away . We could see the swells right out to the horizon , crests perfectly spaced and slightly bowed toward us , like arcs of a circle bigger An Argument for the Deployment ... 227 than the Chryse Gulf itself , sweeping in to curl around Soochow Point and onto our beach , one after the next , all pitching over first at the new point break , then breaking in a continuous clean line all the way across the beach to the new river mouth , far to the right . The break was swift but not too swift , and each was slightly different , of course , shallow bowls giving way to quick walls , or long tubular sections purling over in perfect clear waterfalls . Conditions could never be more perfect . "
112842	112846	110158	110158	God	636	" Irishka said . "
112851	114673	110158	110158	God	636	" We parked on the bluff just above the beach , got out of the car and put on our wetsuits , then walked down the path and across the beach with flippers in hand . The shorebreak foam ran over our booties and we hooted at the cold water seeping into our wetsuits at the calves — it was about eight or ten degrees , but quickly warmed up . We walked out to where it was waist - deep , then put on fins and pulled up our wetsuit hoods , and dived under the next breaker . Though only our faces were exposed , that was enough to have us all screaming at the shock of the cold , standing again chest deep . We breasted out , still on foot , turning our backs when the waves crashed into us , then dived under a tall white wall of broken water and started swimming . It was hard work getting outside . The waves always look smaller from the beach , and smaller still from up on a bluff , especially when there 's no one riding them to give you a sense of scale . Now we saw firsthand that the broken waves were walls between two and three meters overhead , and getting under one of those can be a workout if you do n't do it right . And no matter how good wetsuits have gotten , it still feels cold in them at first . I dived deep just before a wall hit me and relaxed , letting the bottom of the wave 's underwater revolution shove me back . A bit of turbulence shook me like a flag in a wind , then pushed me up hard , out of the break . I hit the surface swimming head - up freestyle as hard as I could , through the hissing wrack to the next boiling wall , where I dived under again . If you time it right , so that you use the waves ' underwater action to help you , it makes getting out much easier than if you fight the break directly . Irishka is a real master at this , and on this day as always she was already far ahead of us . Six times under for me , and then I saw that I might make it over or through the next wave just before it broke , so I sprinted hard , kicking my long fins and feeling the backwash sucking me out as well , and flew up the face of the next wave and smashed through the clear upper section , then fell down the back of it and swam on to get free of the turbulence . Outside ! 228 THE MARTIANS And the next wave was just a lift into the air , giving me a brief view around . I was floating just down the line from the point break , and I could see Irishka and Freya already out there ahead of me . Irishka swam out to a wave , then turned and was swimming backstroke hard when the wave picked her up — a big mass of water , a mound swelling into a wall as if by magic , carrying Irishka higher and higher on it . Then she spun onto her chest and fell down the face of the wave . She extended her webbed gloves down and before her , making a little planing surface , then twisted and made a sharp bottom turn , throwing a white wing of water out away from her cut . Wetsuits these days are much like birdsuits , in that they stiffen in reaction to the stress on them , and the knees will lock together , allowing Irishka to hydroplane over the water 's surface , touching it only with her hands , lower legs , and fins . She skidded like that out onto the broad shoulder of the wave , which was breaking left at a steady majestic pace , not fast except in occasional bowl sections , which she fired across ; but usually she had time enough to carve lines up and down the face , slipping up near the crest and then shooting down and dangerously far out in front of the break , where in effect she had to catch the wave all over again , but with much more momentum this time , so she could rise back up the steepening face toward the waterfall that was pitching out over the flat water below . A tube , yes ! There was a fast section mid - beach , it appeared , where the wave went tubular for long stretches , so that Irishka disappeared from my sight for seconds , then shot out of the tube high onto the shoulder , cutting down again to stay in the wave . Yow ! I cried , and swam hard for the point break . Freya took off on one just as I arrived , and disappeared past me with a whoop . Now I had the break entirely to myself , and the very next wave looked just as good as all the previous ones , even a bit better . I swam for the steepest part of it , and saw I had gotten to its takeoff zone in time , and so turned and swam hard for shore . The wave picked me up and I began falling down its face , and knew I had caught it . After a big turn at the bottom I barreled out onto the shoulder of the wave , studying the wave rising up under me to my left , but aware also of the rivermouth canyon standing to my right , and the sky . I was riding the wave as if it were a toboggan ride , down a shifting hill perpetually swinging up into reality before me . The experience of riding a wave is so strange it is hard to describe . During the ride time changes , or I should say consciousness of time changes — if these are not the same statement . The moment balloons . An Argument for the Deployment ... 229 You seem to notice ten or a hundred times as many things as you could in any ordinary second . Yet at the same time , or in a paradoxical oscillation , everything seems to rush by in a moment . Each ride seems to be a timeless little eternity , jammed into a few seconds . Often the rides really are only a few seconds long , but they feel that way at their ends even if they have lasted a minute or more . Maybe it 's just that at the end you always feel it was n't long enough ! However one experiences these knots in time , afterward one can scarcely remember the details of what has been a day of perpetual activity , on the part of both you and the world . Something impedes the memory ; there are n't the words for it , perhaps . One ride merges with the next , and at the end of the day , back on the beach in ordinary reality , if you struggle to remember , only certain peak moments come to mind , moments of vision where an image or a movement branded itself in the brain for good , to come back in unexpected moments and unremembered dreams . So of any particular ride that day I can say little , although the first of the day ( like most firsts ) stuck better than most . It was a long and eventful ride , like all the rest that followed . I planed across the shoulder , roller - coastering up and down as the wave bulged beneath me , feeling the way my body was both still and moving rapidly , shifting my angles to stay in the right spot . I saw the fast section coming , and stalled back into a tube that lasted for some time ; then I saw the tube was collapsing , and shot out of its last little oval gate , skidding back out high on the shoulder and almost off the back side of the swell , so that I did a 360 spinner to fall back into the wave , and nailed a bottom turn to fly on again . The ride went on like that for the whole length of the beach , lasting almost two minutes . And all the rides were like that . When they ended we found it easier to roll like grunion onto the shore , spent , and walk back down the beach and swim out at the point , than it would have been to swim out and back south the length of the beach . So we all three got rides and then walked back together , kicking the shallows into fans of spray ahead of us , exclaiming over the rides , and looking around at the sun - drenched day . Then back out for another strenuous fight to get outside , and another wild ride . The waves got bigger as morning gave way to afternoon , and a wind finally disturbed the glassy surface of the water . It was an offshore wind , however , the surfer 's friend ; it held the waves up for us by swooshing downcanyon into the afternoon sun , stalling the breaks and whipping spray off their tops , spray that fell like heavy rain onto 230 THE MARTIANS the back side of the waves . Looking down the line as we bobbed over the crests , we saw some of those brief rainbows in the blown spray that the Hawaiians call ehukai . And late in the day I took off and saw Irishka dropping in ahead of me on the shoulder of the same wave , and after a timeless time I was streaking along deep in the tube behind her , both of us as still as statues and yet flying through a great rolling tube of water swirling up on our left and out over our heads . And I saw the tube close - out begin ahead of Irishka , and both of us turned up and burst back out into the air at the same time , inside the spray flung back by the wind , and I looked over and saw her suspended in the ehukai with her arms outstretched , like a mermaid trying to fly up a rainbow .

SNC Crater , at the foot of the north flank of Ceraunius Tholus , is well supported as the source of the SNC meteorites found on Earth ( cf . Clayborne and Frazier , m4d ) . Drillings were made to a depth of 1 km under the north flank of Ceraunius Tholus , in locations where the ground was 10 - 50 microkelvins warmer than the flank median . Most drill sites were within 4 kms of the prominent lava channel running from the Ceraunius caldera down into SNC Crater . Five drill shafts on the west side of the laval channel ( see map 1 ) encountered the collapsed remains of a thermal spring , which contained ice and pockets of liquid water in the ml . range . The walls of these fractures exhibited ovoid forms , all under 20 nanometers long , resembling the structures found in SNC meteorite ALH 84001 . No metabolic activity was detected in the Ceraunius forms , but electron microscopy reveals what appear to be cell walls , and RNA protein fragments within the forms . PCR was performed on the samples using primers specific for ribosomal RNA , and the products were sequenced , revealing a magnetotactic sequence similar to Terran marine methanogens . Some silicates in the collapsed thermal vent near the recovered material also exhibit stratified spongiform structures highly stromatolitic in appearance , the strata two magnitudes finer than that observed in Terran samples . It is suggested that these are stromatolites , 232 THE MARTIANS and that the ovoid forms are archaea or nanobacteria , either dormant or slowed metabolically in response to a long - failing environment .

We examined the nanobacteria - like structures discovered in drill samples on the north flank of Ceraunius Tholus ( cf . Forbes and Taneev , m61a ) . They exhibit the carbonates , magnetites , and PAHs seen in ALH 84001 , but no movement or metabolic action . As in the case of ALH 84001 in Antarctica , recent contamination of the rock is a possibility , in this case anthropogenic contamination ; hydration of the fault in question may have occurred when the lava tunnel on Ceraunius Tholus was used as a streambed , from ml5 to m38 . Also , while the samples do contain magnetites , we question whether any indigenous archaea or nanobacteria would evolve to produce magnetites when Mars has a magnetic field so slight that it could not be registered for biological use .

By Kim , C.H. , Institute of Areophysics , Senzeni Na ; and Forbes , G.N. , Department of Microbiology , Acheron Institute for Areological Studies . Paleomagnetic studies in the southern half of the crustal dichotomy demonstrate that the paleointensity of the Martian magnetic field was as high as 250 to 1000 nT as recently as 1.3 Gyr ago , probably because of the presence of an active dynamo in the core . This suggests that Mars generated a magnetic moment greater than 1013 T - m3 ( compared with Earth 's moment of 8 x 101S T - m3 ) throughout the Noachian , from approximately 4.1 Gyr to 1.3 Gyr ( cf . Russell et al . , m6j ) . Development of biomagnetism in any early indigenous life would therefore be unsurprising . "

By Forbes , G.N. , Department of Microbiology , University of Mars , Cairo ; Taneev , V.L. , Acheron Institute for Areological Studies ; and Allan , P.F. , Department of Microbiology , University of Mars , Cairo . The archaealike organisms found in Ceraunius , and what appear to be nanofossils of these organisms , resemble in many physical and chemical respects the Methanospirillum jacobii found in the Columbia River basement rock ( see Figure 1.2 ) . Nitrogen in the Martian samples all exhibit the isotropically heavy nitrogen that distinguishes the atmosphere of Mars from virtually all other volatile reservoirs in the solar system , which eliminates contamination as a possible origin . Partial genomic analysis of RNA fragments in the Ceraunius organisms shows a 44.6 % match with DNA from the Columbia basement archaea Methanospirillum jacobii . Such a match can not be explained by independent origin . Seeding of life from one planet to the other is suggested as the most plausible explanation . Lewontin - Thierry mutationrate analysis gives a tentative date for division of the two species at approximately 3.9 Gyr , near the end of the heavy bombardment . "

Left - handedness in amino acids found in Archaea ceraunii from Ceraunius Tholus is shown to predominate in proportion similar to the handedness of the Columbia basement Methanospirillum jacobii ( cf . Ellsworth , N.W. , 2067a ) . Organisms dead longer than 1 Myr would have yielded roughly the same amount of left- and right - handed amino acids in the sample , so the high incidence in the Ceraunius samples indicates some specimens must either still be alive , or have been alive in the last Myr . It is now well established ( cf . Nabdullah , 2054 ) that extremophiles under worsening conditions react to the stress by slowing metabolisms to rates in which cell divisions occur less than once a century . With biologic functions temporarily suspended or greatly slowed , indications of life are clearest in biochemical states such as handedness . "

We determined that , while there appear to be nanobacteria under the north flank of Ceraunius , genomic analysis of DNA fragments from both populations reveals they share 85.4 % of their DNA . Mutation rates as recalibrated by Nguyen and McGonklin gave results indicating the two organisms underwent species division within the last 5000 generations . This suggests the rocks of Ceraunius Tholus were contaminated with Terran nanobacteria some 20 m - years ago , which is within the period when the lava tunnel on the north flank of the volcano was used as a streambed . This practice was discontinued by order of the global environmental court ( cf . GEC Proceedings , m46 , pp . 3245 - 47 ) because the floor of the tunnel was found to be too porous , and in the words of the report , "

A siliceous deposit composed of nearly pure opaline silica was discovered during drilling in Tharsis Tholus . The thermal spring on the west flank , 4.2 kms below the surface , was still active , and the resulting geyserite formation was clearly abiologic in origin . No microbacteria , nanobacteria , archaea , or nanofossils were found in any retrieved rock , all of which was retrieved and handled using GEC - mandated sterilization techniques . "

Mitochondrial analysis clearly shows that the fossil Archaea ceraunii found on site along with living specimens are older than any dated Columbia basement Methanospirillum . Mitochondrial analysis also suggests that the descendant Terran species split from its ancestor about 180 Myr , the time when SNC Crater was formed , and the SNC meteorites thereby cast into space ( cf . Matheson , N. , 1997b ) . This indicates that the Terran archaea may have arrived on Earth in the SNC meteorites . "

Spectrographs analyses of the Shergotty and Zagami meteorites show that both diabase stones consist mainly of the pyroxenes pigeonite and augite , and of maskelynite , a shocked plagioclase glass . The maskelynite is zoned , with accessory phases of titanomagnetite , ilmenite , pyrrhotite , fayalite , tridymite , whitlockite , chlorapatite , and baddeleyite . In situ investigation of the brecciated diabase in SNC Crater and surrounding region reveal that ilmenite and whitlockite are missing from this inventory . Studies at another oval crater about the same age and size on the Elysium Massif , Crater Tf , show that it has the same brecciated diabase , with the same phase accessories , as SNC Crater and environs . The Crater Tf diabase also exhibits a poikilitic texture like that seen in the Chassigny meteorite ( Banin , Clark , and Wanke , 1992 ) . Either crater could have been the origin for the SNC meteorites so far found on Earth . "

Proportions of isotropically heavy nitrogen unique to Mars are present in the archaea found 2.3 kms beneath the surface of Ceraunius Tholus , in ancient thermal springs . Mitochondrial analysis using the revised Thurmond equations confirms that Archaea ceraunii and the Columbia basement nanobacteria Methanospirillum jacobii split from a common ancestor from 6000 to 15,000 generations ago . Rates of mutation in extremophiles that have radically slowed their metabolisms are not yet certain , but there are strong indications that they may be well over a magnitude slower than described by earlier estimates ( cf . Whitebook , H. , m33f ) . This means the Ceraunius and Columbia 236 THE MARTIANS nanobacteria could have split into separate species over 1.8 Gyr . Imbibition rates in basalt are < 1 cm / Myr ( cf . Russell et al . , ml2 t ) , and not all of the Archaea ceraunii were found on the surfaces of cracked rocks in the thermal vent ; some were recovered as much as a meter deep inside unbroken samples . These and other considerations show that Archaea ceraunii can not have been placed in situ by anthropogenic action ; there has not been enough time for them to get there . Indigenous origin is the only good explanation of all the data . Keyword Search ln - The journal of Areological Studies , vols . 65 - 75 Keyword - Archaea ceraunii No match found . Odessa Oh in those days we were so happy . In love , sure . Just the two of us ; no kids ; interesting work ; lots of free time ; all Mars there to be explored together . We would go out into the backcountry on long walkabouts , wandering and talking . Out under the stars at night . For several years we spent the fall in Odessa , where we had work in the vineyards and wineries . We rented a little house in the beach village a few kilometers west of Odessa , at the end of the tram line . A hillside village , looking down on a crook of a beach , buildings clustered at the bottom , scattered among the trees higher up . Our house was pretty high on the hill , with a view down over treetops and tile roofs , and the broad blue plate of the Hellas Sea . Little patio out back , a table and two chairs . A lot of flowering vines , a little lemon tree in a tub . Almost all the summer visitors would be gone by then , so that only one restaurant stayed open , down behind the beach . The cats were friendly and looked sleek and well fed , though no one owned them . In the restaurant one jumped right into my lap and purred . I remember the first time we stood on the patio , looking down , then back at the house — whitewash , vines , the bedroom balcony with an iron railing , the brown hills above and behind , the sea and the sky . We laughed at how perfect it was . Most mornings we trammed into town to work , then came back in the afternoons and went to the beach . Or vice versa . Sunset on the patio with a glass of wine . Dinners in our little kitchen , or down at the restaurant , where a guitar and mandolin duo played on Fridays . Then nights in bed in 238 THE MARTIANS a house all to ourselves . Sometimes I woke before dawn and went down to start coffee and go out on the patio . One of those mornings the sky was plastered with a herringbone cloud that turned pink , then gold . Sexual Dimorphism The potential for hallucination in paleogenomics was high . There was not only the omnipresent role of instrumentation in the envisioning of the ultramicroscopic fossil material , but also the metamorphosis over time of the material itself , both the DNA and its matrices , so that the data were invariably incomplete , and often shattered . Thus the possibility of psychological projection of patterns onto the rorschacherie of what in the end might be purely mineral processes had to be admitted . Dr. Andrew Smith was as aware of these possibilities as anyone . Indeed it constituted one of the central problems of his field — convincingly to sort the traces of DNA in the fossil record , distinguishing them from an array of possible pseudofossils . Pseudofossils littered the history of the discipline , from the earliest false nautiloids to the famous Martian pseudonanobacteria . Nothing progressed in paleogenomics unless you could show that you really were talking about what you said you were talking about . So Dr. Smith did not get too excited , at first , about what he was finding in the junk DNA of an early dolphin fossil . In any case there were quite a few distractions to his work at that time . He was living on the south shore of the Amazonian Sea , that deep southerly bay of the world - ringing ocean , east of Elysium , near the equator . In the summers , even the cool summers they had been having lately , the extensive inshore shallows of the sea grew as warm as blood , and dolphins — adapted from Terran river dolphins like the baiji from China , or the boto from the Amazon , or the susu from the 240 THE MARTIANS Ganges , or the bhulan from the Indus — sported just off the beach . Morning sunlight lanced through the waves and picked out their flashing silhouettes , sometimes groups of eight or ten of them , all playing in the same wave . The marine laboratory he worked at , located on the seafront of the harbor town Eumenides Point , was associated with the Acheron labs , farther up the coast to the west . The work at Eumenides had mostly to do with the shifting ecologies of a sea that was getting saltier . Dr. Smith 's current project dealing with this issue involved investigating the various adaptations of extinct cetaceans who had lived when the Earth 's sea had exhibited different levels of salt . He had in his lab some fossil material , sent to the lab from Earth for study , as well as the voluminous literature on the subject , including the full genomes of all the living descendants of these creatures . The transfer of fossils from Earth introduced the matter of cosmic - ray contamination to all the other problems involved in the study of ancient DNA , but most people dismissed these effects as minor and inconsequential , which was why fossils were shipped across at all . And of course with the recent deployment of fusion - powered rapid vehicles , the amount of exposure to cosmic rays had been markedly reduced . Smith was therefore able to do that research on mammal salt tolerance both ancient and modern , thus helping to illuminate the current situation on Mars , also joining the ongoing debates concerning the paleohalocycles of the two planets , now one of the hot research areas in comparative planetology and bioengineering . Nevertheless , it was a field of research so arcane that if you were not involved in it , you tended not to believe in it . It was an offshoot , a mix of two difficult fields , its ultimate usefulness a long shot , especially compared to most of the inquiries being conducted at the Eumenides Point Labs . Smith found himself fighting a feeling of marginalization in the various lab meetings and informal gatherings , in coffee lounges , cocktail parties , beach luncheons , boating excursions . At all of these he was the odd man out , with only his colleague Frank Drumm , who worked on reproduction in the dolphins currently living offshore , expressing any great interest in his work and its applications . Worse yet , his work appeared to be becoming less and less important to his adviser and employer , Vlad Taneev , who as one of the First Hundred , and the cofounder of the Acheron labs , was ostensibly the most powerful scientific mentor one could have on Mars ; but who in practice turned out to be nearly impossible to access , and rumored to be in failing health , so that it was like having no boss at Sexual Dimorphism 241 all , and therefore no access to the lab 's technical staff and so forth . A bitter disappointment . And then of course there was Selena — his partner , roommate , girlfriend , significant other , lover — there were many words for their relationship , though none was quite right . The woman with whom he lived , with whom he had gone through graduate school and two postdocs , with whom he had moved to Eumenides Point , taking a small apartment near the beach , near the terminus of the coastal tram , where when one looked back east the point itself just heaved over the horizon , like a dorsal fin seen far out to sea . Selena was making great progress in her own field , genetically engineering salt grasses ; a subject of great importance there , where they were trying to stabilize a thousand - kilometer coastline of low dunes and quicksand swamps . Scientific and bioengineering progress ; important achievements , relevant to the situation ; all things were coming to her professionally , including of course offers to team up in any number of exciting public / co - op collaborations . And all things were coming to her privately as well . Smith had always thought her beautiful , and now he saw that with her success , other men were coming to the same realization . It took only a little attention to see it ; an ability to look past shabby lab coats and a generally unkempt style to the sleekly curving body and the intense , almost ferocious intelligence . No — his Selena looked much like all the rest of the lab rats when in the lab , but in the summers when the group went down in the evening to the warm tawny beach to swim , she walked out the long expanse of the shallows like a goddess in a bathing suit , like Venus returning to the sea . Everyone in these parties pretended not to notice , but they could n't help it . All very well ; except that she was losing interest in him . This was a process that Smith feared was irreversible ; or , to be more precise , that if it had gotten to the point where he could notice it , it was too late to stop it . So now he watched her , furtive and helpless , as they went through their domestic routines ; there was a goddess in his bathroom , showering , drying off , dressing , each moment like a dance . But she did n't chat anymore . She was absorbed in her thoughts , and tended to keep her back to him . No — it was all going away . They had met in an adult swim club in Mangala , while they were both grad students at the university there . Now , as if to reinvoke that time , Smith took up Frank 's suggestion and joined him at an equivalent club in Eumenides Point , and began to swim regularly again . He 242 THE MARTIANS went from the tram or the lab down to the big fifty - meter pool , set on a terrace overlooking the ocean , and swam so hard in the mornings that the whole rest of the day he buzzed along in a flow of betaendorphins , scarcely aware of his work problems or the situation at home . After work he took the tram home feeling his appetite kick in , and banged around the kitchen throwing together a meal and eating much of it as he cooked it , irritated ( if she was there at all ) with Selena 's poor cooking and her cheery talk about her work , irritated also probably just from hunger , and dread at the situation hanging over them ; at this pretense that they were still in a normal life . But if he snapped at her during this fragile hour she would go silent the whole rest of the evening ; it happened fairly often ; so he tried to contain his temper and make the meal and quickly eat his part of it , to get his blood - sugar level back up . Either way she fell asleep abruptly around nine , and he was left to read into the timeslip , or even slip out and take a walk on the night beach a few hundred yards away from their apartment . One night , walking west , he saw Pseudophobos pop up into the sky like a distress flare down the coast , and when he came back into the apartment Selena was awake and talking happily on the phone ; she was startled to see him , and cut the call short , thinking about what to say , and then said , "
118951	118952	119003	119003	I	0	" "
118957	118978	118990	118990	you	716	" he said , moving into the dark kitchen so she would n't see his face . That annoyed her . "
118992	118993	119003	119003	I	0	" "
119006	119330	119338	119338	he	4075	" She dismissed that with a noise . Then one day he got home and Mark was there with her , in the living room , and at a single glance he could see they had been laughing about something ; had been sitting closer together than when he started opening the door . He ignored that and was as pleasant as he could be . The next day as he swam at the morning workout , he watched the women swimming with him in his lane . All three of them had swum all their lives , their freestyle stroke perfected beyond the perfection of any dance move ever made on land , the millions of repetitions making their movement as unconscious as that of the fish in the sea . Under the surface he saw their bodies flowing forward , revealing their sleek Sexual Dimorphism 243 lines — classic swimmer lines , like Selena's — rangy shoulders tucking up against their ears one after the next , rib cages smoothed over by powerful lats , breasts flatly merged into big pecs or else bobbing left then right , as the case might be ; bellies meeting high hipbones accentuated by the high cut of their swimsuits , backs curving up to bottoms rounded and compact , curving to powerful thighs then long calves , and feet outstretched like ballerinas ' . Dance was a weak analogy for such beautiful movement . And it all went on for stroke after stroke , lap after lap , until he was mesmerized beyond further thought or observation ; it was just one aspect of a sensually saturated environment . Their current lane leader was pregnant , yet swimming stronger than any of the rest of them , not even huffing and puffing during their rest intervals , when Smith often had to suck air — instead she laughed and shook her head , exclaiming , "
119343	119608	119618	119618	Selena	713	" She was seven months along , round in the middle like a little whale , but still she fired down the pool at a rate none of the other three in the lane could match . The strongest swimmers in the club were simply amazing . Soon after getting into the sport , Smith had worked hard to swim a hundred - meter freestyle in less than a minute , a goal appropriate to him , and finally he had done it once at a meet and been pleased ; then later he heard about the local college women 's team 's workout , which consisted of a hundred hundred - meter freestyle swims all on a minute interval . He understood then that although all humans looked roughly the same , some were stupendously stronger than others . Their pregnant leader was in the lower echelon of these strong swimmers , and regarded the swim she was making today as a light stretching - out , though it was beyond anything her lane mates could do with their best efforts . You could n't help watching her when passing by in the other direction , because despite her speed she was supremely smooth and effortless — she took fewer strokes per lap than the rest of them , and yet still made substantially better time . It was like magic . And that sweet blue curve of the new child inside . Back at home things continued to degenerate . Selena often worked late , and talked to him less than ever . "
119613	119617	119622	119622	you	4076	" he said . "
119624	119625	119622	119622	you	4076	" "
119629	120361	120364	120364	you	4077	" He tried to throw himself into his work . They were at the same lab , they could go home late together . Talk like they used to about their work , which though not the same , was still genomics in both cases ; 244 THE MARTIANS how much closer could two sciences be ? Surely it would help to bring them back together . But genomics was a very big field . It was possible to occupy different parts of it , no doubt about that . They were proving it . Smith persevered , however , using a new and more powerful electron microscope , and he began to make some headway in unraveling the patterns in his fossilized DNA . It looked like what had been preserved in the samples he had been given was almost entirely what used to be called the junk DNA of the creature . In times past this would have been bad luck , but the Kohl labs in Acheron had recently been making great strides in unraveling the various purposes of junk DNA , which proved not to be useless after all , as might have been guessed , evolution being as parsimonious as it was . Their breakthrough consisted in characterizing very short and scrambled repetitive sequences within junk DNA that could be shown to code instructions for higher hierarchical operations than they were used to seeing at the gene level — cell differentiation , information order sequencing , apoptosis and the like . Using this new understanding to unravel any clues in partially degraded fossil junk DNA would be hard , of course . But the nucleotide sequences were there in his EM images — or , to be more precise , the characteristic mineral replacements for the adenine - thymine and cytosine - guanine couplets , replacements well established in the literature , were there to be clearly identified . Nanofossils , in effect ; but legible to those who could read them . And once read , it was then possible to brew identical sequences of living nucleotides , matching the originals of the fossil creature . In theory one could re - create the creature itself , though in practice nothing like the entire genome was ever there , making it impossible . Not that there were n't people trying anyway with simpler fossil organisms , either going for the whole thing or using hybrid DNA techniques to graft expressions they could decipher onto living templates , mostly descendants of the earlier creature . With this particular ancient dolphin , almost certainly a freshwater dolphin ( though most of these were fairly salt tolerant , living in river mouths as they did ) , complete resuscitation would be impossible . It was n't what Smith was trying to do anyway . What would be interesting would be to find fragments that did not seem to have a match in the living descendants ' genome , then hopefully synthesize living in vitro fragments , clip them into contemporary strands , and see how these experimental animals did in hybridization tests and in various environments . Look for differences in function . Sexual Dimorphism 245 He was also doing mitochondrial tests when he could , which if successful would permit tighter dating for the species ' divergence from precursor species . He might be able to give it a specific slot on the marine mammal family tree , which during the early Pliocene was very complicated . Both avenues of investigation were labor - intensive , time - consuming , almost thoughtless work — perfect , in other words . He worked for hours and hours every day , for weeks , then months . Sometimes he managed to go home on the tram with Selena ; more often he did n't . She was writing up her latest results with her collaborators , mostly with Mark . Her hours were irregular . When he was working he did n't have to think about that ; so he worked all the time . It was not a solution , not even a very good strategy — it even seemed to be making things worse — and he had to attempt it against an ever - growing sense of despair and loss ; but he did it nevertheless . "
120371	120397	120364	120364	you	4077	" he asked Frank one day at work , pointing to the latest printout from the Kohl lab , lying heavily annotated on his desk . "
120421	120422	120364	120364	you	4077	" "
120430	120431	120487	120487	They	4080	" "
120480	120486	120487	120487	They	4080	" Smith nodded , pleased . "
120494	120495	120487	120487	They	4080	" "
120508	120509	120516	120516	you	0	" "

120582	120687	120777	120777	you	0	" Smith shrugged . Whole - genome shotgun sequencing struck him as slipshod , but it was certainly faster . Reading small bits of singlestranded DNA , called expressed sequence tags , had quickly identified most of the genes on the human genome ; but it had missed some , and it ignored even the regulatory DNA sequences controlling the protein - coding portion of the genes , not to mention the so - called 246 THE MARTIANS junk DNA itself , filling long stretches between the more clearly meaningful sequences . Smith expressed his doubts to Frank , who nodded , but said , "
120786	120799	120826	120826	Sloppy	720	" Smith nodded . That night he and Selena trammed home together . "
120819	120825	120826	120826	Sloppy	720	" he asked her shyly . "
120828	120832	120826	120826	Sloppy	720	" she said . "
120836	121302	121339	121339	You	4082	" A new schedule evolved . He worked , swam , took the tram home . Usually Selena was n't there . Often their answering machine held messages for her from Mark , talking about their work . Or messages from her to Smith , telling him that she would be home late . As it was happening so often , he sometimes went out for dinner with Frank and other lane mates , after the evening workouts . One time at a beach restaurant they ordered several pitchers of beer , and then went out for a walk on the beach , and ended up running out into the shallows of the bay and swimming around in the warm dark water , so different from their pool , splashing each other and laughing hard . It was a good time . But when he got home that night , there was another message on the answering machine from Selena , saying that she and Mark were working on their paper after getting a bite to eat , and that she would be home extra late . She was n't kidding ; at two o'clock in the morning she was still out . In the long minutes following the timeslip Smith realized that no one stayed out so late working on a paper without calling home . This was therefore a message of a different kind . Pain and anger swept through him , first one then the other . The indirection of it struck him as cowardly . He deserved at least a revelation — a confession — a scene . As the long minutes passed he got angrier and angrier ; then frightened for a moment , that she might Sexual Dimorphism 247 have been hurt or something . But she had n't . She was out there somewhere fooling around . Suddenly he was furious . He pulled cardboard boxes out of their closet and yanked open her drawers , and threw all her clothes in heaps into the boxes , crushing them in so they would all fit . But they gave off their characteristic scent of laundry soap and her , and smelling it he groaned and sat down on the bed , knees weak . If he carried through with this he would never again see her putting on and taking off these clothes , and just as an animal he groaned at the thought . But men are not animals . He finished throwing her things into boxes , took them outside the front door , and dropped them there . She came back at three . He heard her kick into the boxes and make some muffled exclamation . He hurled open the door and stepped out . "
121307	121338	121339	121339	You	4082	" She had been startled out of whatever scenario she had planned , and now was getting angry . Her , angry ! It made him furious all over again . “
121345	121346	121351	121351	You	4082	” “
121349	121350	121353	121353	Mark	716	" "
121355	121360	121353	121353	Mark	716	" She eyed him . “
121365	121371	121381	121381	your	4082	" she said at last . “
121385	121413	121454	121454	I	0	" Gesturing down at the boxes . He hit her in the face . Immediately he crouched at her side and helped her sit up , saying , "
121431	121453	121417	121417	I	0	" he had only thought to slap her for her contempt , contempt that he had not noticed her betrayal earlier , “
121460	121462	121421	121421	I	0	" . “
121464	121475	121486	121488	you miserable bastard	4083	away”-striking him off with wild blows , crying and shouting , "
121481	121483	121531	121531	I	0	" — frightened—"you
121501	121530	121561	121561	I	0	" in a near shriek , though she kept her voice down too , aware still of the apartment complex around them . Hands held to her face . “
121565	122137	121561	121561	I	0	" By now he was as angry at himself as he had been at her — what could he have been thinking , why had he given her the moral high ground like this , it was she who had broken their bond , it was she who should be in the wrong ! She who was now sobbing — turning away — suddenly walking off into the night . Lights went on in a couple of windows nearby . 248 THE MARTIANS Smith stood staring down at the boxes of her lovely clothes , his right knuckles throbbing . That life was over . He lived on alone in the apartment by the beach , and kept going in to work , but he was shunned there by the others , who all knew what had happened . Selena did not come in to work again until the bruises were gone , and after that she did not press charges , or speak to him about that night , but she did move in with Mark , and avoided Smith at work when she could . As who would n't . Occasionally she dropped by his nook to ask in a neutral voice about some logistical aspect of their breakup . He could not meet her eye . Nor could he meet the eye of anyone else at work , not properly . It was strange how one could have a conversation with people and appear to be meeting their gaze during it , when all the time they were not really quite looking at you and you were not really quite looking at them . Primate subtleties , honed over millions of years on the savannah . He lost appetite , lost energy . In the morning he would wake up and wonder why he should get out of bed . Then looking at the blank walls of the bedroom , where Selena 's prints had hung , he would sometimes get so angry at her that his pulse hammered uncomfortably in his neck and forehead . That got him out of bed , but then there was nowhere to go , except work . And there everyone knew he was a wife beater , a domestic abuser , an asshole . Martian society did not tolerate such people . Shame or anger ; anger or shame . Grief or humiliation . Resentment or regret . Lost love . Omnidirectional rage . Mostly he did n't swim anymore . The sight of the swimmer women was too painful now , though they were as friendly as always ; they knew nothing of the lab except him and Frank , and Frank had not said anything to them about what had happened . It made no difference . He was cut off from them . He knew he ought to swim more , and he swam less . Whenever he resolved to turn things around he would swim two or three days in a row , then let it fall away again . Once at the end of an early - evening workout he had forced himself to attend — and now he felt better , as usual — while they were standing in the lane steaming , his three most constant lane mates made quick plans to go to a nearby trattoria after showering . One looked at him . "
122143	122149	121561	121561	I	0	" He shook his head . "
122154	122164	122165	122165	Ah	4085	" he said sadly . They laughed at this . "

122185	122193	122194	122194	I	0	" Frank said from the next lane . "

122208	122221	122165	122165	Ah	4085	" the women said . Frank often swam in their lane too . "
122224	122229	122165	122165	Ah	4085	" Smith roused himself . "
122232	122329	122331	122331	you	4086	" He sat with them and listened to their chatter around the restaurant table . They still seemed to be slightly steaming , their hair wet and wisping away from their foreheads . The three women were young . It was interesting ; away from the pool they looked ordinary and undistinguished : skinny , mousy , plump , maladroit , whatever . With their clothes on you could not guess at their fantastically powerful shoulders and lats , their compact smooth musculatures . Like seals dressed up in clown suits , waddling around a stage . "
122334	122346	122331	122331	you	4086	" one asked him when he had been silent too long . "
122352	122360	122331	122331	you	4086	" He hesitated , glanced at Frank . "
122367	122368	122331	122331	you	4086	" "
122379	122398	122399	122399	You	4086	" Hand to his arm ( they all bumped into each other all the time in the pool ): "
122408	122409	122399	122399	You	4086	" "
122412	122417	122399	122399	You	4086	" He smiled ruefully . "
122423	122479	122399	122399	You	4086	" He could never tell them about what had happened . And Frank would n't either . But without that none of the rest of his story made any sense . So he could n't talk about any of it . They sensed this and shifted in their seats , preparatory to changing the topic . "
122483	122490	122399	122399	You	4086	" Frank said , helping them . "
122498	122499	122399	122399	You	4086	" "
122504	122543	122884	122884	They	4091	" one of the women joked , elbowing him . He nodded , tried to smile . They looked at each other . One asked the waiter for the check , and another said to Smith and Frank , "
122567	122883	122884	122884	They	4091	" She rented a room in a little house with an enclosed courtyard , and all the rest of the residents were away . They followed her through the dark house into the courtyard , and took the cover off the hot tub and turned it on , then took their clothes off and got in the steaming water . Smith joined them , feeling shy . People on the beaches of Mars sunbathed without clothes all the time , it was no big deal really . Frank seemed not to notice , he was perfectly relaxed . But they did n't swim at the pool like this . They all sighed at the water 's heat . The woman from the house went inside and brought out some beer and cups . Light from the kitchen fell on her as she put down the dumpie and passed out the 250 THE MARTIANS cups . Smith already knew her body perfectly well from their many hours together in the pool ; nevertheless he was shocked seeing the whole of her . Frank ignored the sight , filling the cups from the dumpie . They drank beer , talked small talk . Two were vets ; their lane leader , the one who had been pregnant , was a bit older , a chemist in a pharmaceutical lab near the pool . Her baby was being watched by her coop that night . They all looked up to her , Smith saw , even here . These days she brought the baby to the pool and swam just as powerfully as ever , parking the baby - carrier just beyond the splash line . Smith 's muscles melted in the hot water , he sipped his beer while listening to them . One of the women looked down at her breasts in the water and laughed . "
122890	122897	122900	122900	women	865	" Smith had already noticed that . "
122906	122907	122900	122900	women	865	" "
122922	122944	122952	122952	I	0	" Their leader looked down through her fogged glasses , pink - faced , hair tied up , misted , demure . "

123026	123040	123047	123047	you	0	" But they were laughing too hard for her to complete this scenario . "
123050	123131	123047	123047	you	0	" They only laughed more . Frank was cracking up , looking blissed , blessed . These women friends trusted them . But Smith still felt set apart . He looked at their lane leader : a pink bespectacled goddess , serenely vague and unaware ; the scientist as heroine ; the first full human being . But later when he tried to explain this feeling to Frank , or even just to describe it , Frank shook his head . "
123141	123145	123187	123187	they	1111	" he warned . "
123195	123196	123187	123187	they	1111	" "

123257	123263	123264	123264	You	4097	" Smith stared at him . "

123366	123549	123621	123621	I	0	" Smith shook his head . It would be comforting to think so . But the data did not support the hypothesis . Ninety - five percent of all the murders in history had been committed by men . This was a difference . He said as much , but Frank was not impressed . The murder ratio was becoming more nearly equal on Mars , he replied , and much less frequent for everybody , thus demonstrating very nicely that the matter was culturally conditioned , an artifact of Terran patriarchy no longer relevant on Mars . Nurture rather than nature . Although it was a false dichotomy . Nature could prove anything you wanted , Frank insisted . Female hyenas were vicious killers , male bonobos and muriquis were gentle cooperators . It meant nothing , Frank said . It told them nothing . But Frank had not hit a woman in the face without ever planning to . Patterns in the fossil Into data sets became clearer and clearer . Stochastic - resonance programs highlighted what had been preserved . "
123553	123580	123607	123607	You	0	" Smith said to Frank one afternoon when Frank leaned in to say good - bye for the day . He pointed at his computer screen . "

123718	123728	123821	123821	you	0	" He glanced quickly at Smith . Smith said , "

123766	123770	123821	123821	you	0	" Frank said . "

123834	123853	123821	123821	you	0	" Frank glanced down at him , startled , then noncommittal . Seeing this Smith became inexplicably frightened . "
123857	123861	123884	123884	Acheron	344	" Frank said . "

123914	123936	123979	123979	Selena	713	" Frank looked even more noncommittal than before . He glanced out the door of the nook . Finally he said , "
123982	124019	124069	124069	they	4113	" Smith nodded , feeling his stomach tighten . He had admitted as much a few months before . Frank was one of the very few people these days who would look him in the eye . "
124088	124097	124121	124123	the old man	2769	" He looked down at Smith and stopped . "
124125	124126	124133	124133	Frank	497	" "
124135	124136	124164	124164	You	723	" "
124177	124178	124161	124161	you	723	" "
124181	125927	124161	124161	you	723	" Frank left . Sexual Dimorphism 253 Sometimes he fell asleep at his desk . He got some of his work done in dreams . Sometimes he found he could sleep down on the beach , wrapped in a greatcoat on the fine sand , lulled by the sound of the waves rolling in . At work he stared at the lined dots and letters on the screens , constructing the schematics of the sequences , nucleotide by nucleotide . Most were completely unambiguous . The correlation between the two main schematics was excellent , far beyond the possibility of chance . X chromosomes in humans clearly exhibited nongene DNA traces of a distant aquatic ancestor , a kind of dolphin . Y chromosomes in humans lacked these passages , and they also matched with chimpanzees more completely than X chromosomes did . Frank had appeared not to believe it , but there it was , right on the screen . But how could it be ? What did it mean ? Where did any of them get what they were ? They had natures from birth . Just under five million years ago , chimps and humans separated out as two different species from a common ancestor , a woodland ape . The Ms geoffrensis fossil Smith was working on had been precisely dated to about 5.1 million years old . About half of all orangutan sexual encounters are rape . One night after quitting work alone in the lab , he took a tram in the wrong direction , downtown , without ever admitting to himself what he was doing , until he was standing outside Mark 's apartment complex , under the steep rise of the dorsum ridge . Walking up a staircased alleyway ascending the ridge gave him a view right into Mark 's windows . And there was Selena , washing dishes at the kitchen window and looking back over her shoulder to talk with someone . The tendon in her neck stood out in the light . She laughed . Smith walked home . It took an hour . Many trams passed him . He could n't sleep that night . He went down to the beach and lay rolled in his greatcoat . Finally he fell asleep . He had a dream . A small hairy bipedal primate , chimp - faced , walked like a hunchback down a beach in east Africa , in the late - afternoon sun . The warm water of the shallows lay greenish and translucent . Dolphins rode inside the waves . The ape waded out into the shallows . Long powerful arms , evolved for hitting ; a quick grab and he had one by the tail , by the dorsal fin . Surely it could escape , but it did n't try . Female ; the ape turned her over , mated with her , released her . He left and came back to find the dolphin in the shallows , giving birth to twins , one male one female . The ape 's troop swarmed into the 254 THE MARTIANS shallows , killed and ate them both . Farther offshore the dolphin birthed two more . The dawn woke Smith . He stood and walked out into the shallows . He saw dolphins inside the transparent indigo waves . He waded out into the surf . The water was only a little colder than the workout pool . The dawn sun was low . The dolphins were only a little longer than he was , small and lithe . He bodysurfed with them . They were faster than he in the waves , but flowed around him when they had to . One leaped over him and splashed back into the curl of the wave ahead of him . Then one flashed under him , and on an impulse he grabbed at its dorsal fin and caught it , and was suddenly moving faster in the wave , as it rose with both of them inside it — by far the greatest bodysurfing ride of his life . He held on . The dolphin and all the rest of its pod turned and swam out to sea , and still he held on . This is it , he thought . Then he remembered that they were airbreathers too . It was going to be all right . Enough Is lis Good As o Feast ■ hi — * We built our house on the apron of Jones Crater , latitude 19 degrees south , longitude 20 degrees . The apron was pretty well populated , some two thousand farms like ours scattered around it , but we could not see any other homesteads from ours , even though we built most of it on the top of a broad - backed low ridge raying down the southwest flank of the crater . We could see the vineyards of the Namibians ' village to the north of us , and the tops of the line of cypresses that bordered their pond . And down the apron the bare rock in our prospect was patched with light green squares , marking young orchards like ours . Craters turned out to be one of the places that people homed in on when they moved out into the backcountry , especially in the southern highlands . For one thing there were a million of them , so it was easy to find empty ones . At first people sheltered inside them , in the early years often doming the craters over and establishing little central crater lakes . By the time the ambient air had become livable , people had learned that settling inside a crater is like moving into a hole . Short days , no view , problems with flooding , and so on . So the new open - air settlements moved out over the rims onto the aprons , to have a look around . The interiors became full crater lakes , or lakes and rice terraces , depending on their climate , water allotment , pan integrity , and the like . Meanwhile the aprons were developed into crops , orchards , and pasturage , wherever there were the right conditions for soil creation . Fissures raying down the aprons served as the streambeds for rapid tumultuous creeks , the water pumped to their 256 THE MARTIANS tops , or drawn down from rim water tanks that were pump - filled . Irrigation systems were always elaborate . Meanwhile the rims themselves tended to turn into the downtowns , as they had the longest views , and access both back in to the old towns in the crater interiors , and out to the many new settlements stretching down the apron . Rim roads called High Street became common , with fully developed urbanization all the way around . For small craters , the thousands that are around one kilometer in diameter , the densely populated rim was like a large village , very homey and comfortable ; everyone known by sight , that kind of thing . Perhaps a thousand people ; then the apron would typically have a population of half that , or less . With bigger craters the rim towns got bigger , of course , and a town of fifty thousand people on the rim of a ten - kilometer crater was a common sight , something like the hilltop city - states of the Italian Renaissance , or American Midwestern college towns , in their characters — and there were hundreds of them . Some prospered and became bustling little cities , spilling down into their interiors , which were like central parks , with round lakes or sculptured wetlands . The aprons almost always stayed agricultural , often supplying most of the food for the city up top . All these aspects of crater culture grew up spontaneously as the pattern language of the landscape , so to speak , combined with the emerging co - op culture , and , most simply , the needs of the people in the region being met in a rational way . Of course there was some planning . People would arrive at an unoccupied crater ( among the some twenty thousand still listed by the environmental court for the southern highlands alone ) with permits and programs , and set to work , and the first decade 's economic activity in the town was primarily the building of it , often by people who had an idea what they wanted ; sometimes with people holding tattered copies of A Pattern Language or some other design primer in their hands , or surfing the Web for things they liked . But soon enough every crater had people moving in who were out of the original group 's control , and then it was a matter of spontaneous group self - organization , a process which works extremely well when the group is socially healthy . Jones Crater was a big one , fifty kilometers in diameter , and its rim town was a beautiful new thing of transparent mushroom buildings and water tanks , and stone - faced skyscrapers clustered at the four points of the compass . Most of our farm group had been working up in town for some time , and eventually twenty families working on various ag projects decided to try moving downslope together , establishing a homestead and entering it into one of the ag travel loops . So Enough Is As Good As a Feast 257 we asked the regional environmental court for tenant rights to unclaimed land on the ray ridge , some forty kilometers down the southsouthwest slope of the rim , and when we got the stewardship permits we moved on down and lived in tents that first winter . We had nothing , really , but the tents were big house tents from an earlier era , for the most part transparent and very pleasant to live in , as we could see so much of the world and its weather . So even though we were short on many things , that winter was so nice that we decided to build diskhouses as our permanent structures , so that we would continue to "
125933	126117	124133	124133	Frank	497	" These diskhouses were based on a design by a Paul Sattelmeier , from Minnesota . They were very simple , functional , and open places to live in , and easy to build . We got on the list for a mobile mold , and when it rolled by we punched in the commands and watched it throw big pottery : round roofs and slightly larger round floors , and then the walls , which were all interior straight segments ; in effect the roof rested on a kind of double M made of interior walls , located under one semicircle of the roof only ; the other side was the living room , a kind of big semicircular verandah , the roof freestanding over it . The several short walls extended from the central cross - wall into the other half of the house , dividing that semicircle into three bedrooms , two interior bathrooms , and part of a kitchen . The living rooms we faced downslope to give us the long view to the southwest , and the exterior circular "
126119	127398	124161	124161	you	723	" on that side was only a clear tenting drape , which could be left open , which is what we did most of the time , living out in the wind ; or else closed if it was cold or rainy . Same with the bedrooms on the upslope side , except their drape walls were white or colored or polarized to make them opaque . But those too were usually left open . So we threw the parts for sixteen of these diskhouses , and then put them together . If you 're willing to do the labor the whole operation is not that expensive , although admittedly we were in hock to our town co - op right to the ears . For the most part the assembly of the diskhouses was straightforward , indeed a great pleasure . Some parts just grew into place after we set the right cultures to work : Our toilets and sinks and bathtubs and tile floors , for instance , were all bioceramic and grew right into their places , essentially as a kind of templated coral . Really lovely to see . Long before we had even started on the houses , however , we were out laying soil and planting our orchards and vineyards . We grew as much of our own food as we could in truck gardens around the tents , 258 THE MARTIANS using complete soils trucked in , but our money crop , our contribution to the Jones economy , was to be almonds and wine grapes , both proven growers on that flank of the apron . The wines being made up to that point had a volcanic tang to them that I did n't like , almost a sulfur touch , but that was okay ; it left room for improvement . And the almonds were great . We prepped soil and planted three hundred hectares of almonds and five hundred of wine grapes , in broad terraces concentric to the rim far above us , the ag zones broken by ponds and swamps , and all of them widening as they dropped downslope , so that they made a kind of giant quilt , pendant on our little farm which lay at the top of the land in our care . It was our work of art , and we were very devoted to it . I imagine we were like first - generation kibbutzim in many respects . About twenty couples , four of them samesex ; eleven single adults ; thirty - odd kids , later fifty - three . Lots of travel by all of us on the local cog rail line up to Jones , and also laterally to other farms on the apron , to socialize and see what other people were doing agriculturally , and in their settlement design . They were all artists too . I was involved throughout with our enology , and we made a good fume blanc eventually , but my field work ended up being mostly in the almond orchards , strangely enough . It happened because I got caught up in the nutsedge problem . Early on we found some sedge creeping out of a radial - strip swamp into the vineyards , and I had gotten rid of it by direct removal . So when the almond orchards were infested I was called on to do it again there . But this time it was n't so easy . Nutsedge is one of several plants I wish they had never introduced to Mars , but it 's good in wet sandy areas , so at first people seeded it to help build meadows . It 's a very ancient plant , coevolved with dinosaurs , I suspect , making it very hardy ; and impervious to most attempts at eradication . In fact I 've come to believe it regards such efforts as friendly stimulation , like a massage . But I only found that out the hard way . I ca n't tell you how many days I spent out in our orchards weeding nutsedge . We had decided to be an organic farm , no chemical pesticides , so it was a matter of either biological control or hand - to - hand combat . I tried both , so what I was doing was integrated pest management . But ineffective no matter what you called it . For many hours I sat on the low ground at the southern end of the young almond trees , in what was in effect a ragged lawn of purple nutsedge . Cyperus rotundus . If it had been yellow nutsedge there would have been people in my group encouraging us to harvest it and eat the nuts . But purple nuts Enough Is As Good As a Feast 259 are hard brown gnarled oblong fibrous tubules , white inside and ghastly bitter to the tongue . They lie about half a meter below the ground , connected to the surface blades of grass by thin shoots that break at the slightest tug , and connected to each other underground by wiry rhizomes that also break easily , leaving the nuts behind . At first I thought I was succeeding when I loosened the soil and sifted through it to get all the nuts out of it . It was slow but not unpleasant work , sitting on the dirt in the sun , getting dirt under my fingernails , looking at the friable soil for the dirt clods that were actually living pebbles . The blades above , stacked in triplet tassels , V - shaped in cross section and stiffer than grass blades , I pulled and composted . The nuts I ground up and tossed in the supercooker compost , feeling superstitious . Which turned out to be not inappropriate given what happened . A careful sifting of soil to a depth of half a meter , throughout the entire region of its growth — and the next spring the precise region I had weeded sprang forth in a thick lawn of young nutsedge . I could n't believe my eyes . That was when I got serious about my research , and found out about the Sedge Grass Support Group , and learned from them that fragments of the rhizomes only five hundred nanometers long had been observed to regenerate the full plant in a single growing season . Some other method was called for . And around that time I got to take a break to regroup as well , as our farm began full participation in one of the ag labor rings of the River League , which meant we went out on the road as nomad farm labor for two months of the fall harvests , moving from farm to farm in the ring as the various crops came ready . Other groups passed through our place while we were gone , with Elke and Rachel left behind to supervise their work . I saw nutsedge in many other places around Jones Crater , and began to exchange stories and theories with the people who had tried to combat it . It was a nice way to meet people . I noticed that quite a few of them had become fanatical on the sedge issue without actually conquering their infestation , which struck me as a bad sign . But I got home that 2 November and tried cover - cropping , on the suggestion of someone who had said , "
127407	128610	124161	124161	you	723	" in a way that made me think this was not a bad thing to have in one 's life . So it was clover in the fall and winter and cowpeas in the spring and summer , always thickly matted over the sedge , which as a result sometimes did not appear for years at a time . But then if I was late planting a new spring cover crop by even a week , a carpet of tasseled green little pagodas would shove through the dying old cover crop , and it was back to square one . 260 THE MARTIANS Once when a cowpea crop got beat to the punch I solarized the ground with clear plastic sheets , and recorded temperatures near boiling underneath it . Some IPM folks looked at it and estimated that everything had to have been killed down to twenty centimeters ; but others said two ; and though the plant matter on the surface was indeed toasted by the end of the summer , the moment I took the plastic off the green carpet came shooting back . Tilling and drying the soil for four years was my next option . But then someone visiting the farm innocently suggested a new chemical pesticide that had gotten good results for the Namibians to the north . That provoked a controversy . Some were content to continue pursuing the various fruitless strategies of the organic battle . Others suggested we give up and let the area become a sedge swamp . But because sedge seed - disperses as well as spreading by underground growth of the rhizomes , little patches of it were springing up everywhere downwind of my orchard lawn . And the wind blows in all directions eventually . So leaving it alone was not really acceptable . Meanwhile , eight years of combat had only made the lawn more luxuriant . You could have played croquet on my patch at that point . So a majority of our group finally talked a small minority into a one - time exception to our organic policy , in order to make an application of some methyl 5-{[(4,6 dimethoxy-2 - pyrimidinyl)amino]carbyonylaminosulfonyl}-3 - chloro - l - methyl - l - H - pyrazole-4 - carboxylate . When we did it we turned it into a kind of Balinese mask dance ceremony , and the people against the idea dressed as demons and cursed us , and we sprayed the stuff and left for an extended work trip . We harvested grapes in riverside vineyards and built stone drywall terracing , and saw parts of Her Desher Vallis , Nirgal Vallis , Uxboi Vallis , Clota Vallis , Ruda Vallis , Arda Vallis , Ladon Vallis , Oltis Vallis , Himera Vallis , and the Samara Valles . All these are little riverine canyons to the immediate southwest of Jones — beautiful country , reminiscent of the Four Corners area of North America , though our neighbors assure us it is also very like parts of central Namibia . Whatever ; when we returned home , the land downslope to the southwest now seemed to suggest the beautiful little canyons that we knew broke the plateau even though we could not see them , canyons held now in our minds ' eye , sunken meandering gardens floored with streams and cottonwood islands . And the nutsedge was gone . Not all of it , but everything that we had sprayed . And if you catch it early enough new sedges do not have the regenerative ability of an established bed , because the nuts are not yet down there . Enough Is As Good As a Feast 261 So we planted new ground cover under the blossoming almond trees , and life went on , the farm growing more luxuriant all the time . Of course things changed ; Elke and Rachel moved to Burroughs , and later Matthew and Jan did too , complaining that among other things it was not an organic farm anymore , which made me feel bad . But the others in their house assured me that pesticide policy was the last thing they had been thinking of when they left ; and I was shocked to hear what some of the other things were . Apparently I had been oblivious ; and in fact , they all went on to tell me , no one else but me on the farm had considered the nutsedge problem to have been of much importance . What I had thought was a crisis and a knotty problem in invasion biology , they considered a matter of housekeeping , a mere irritant among more important issues , and , more than anything else , the bee in my bonnet . Of course compared to the big climate shift that came later , this was probably the right way to regard it . But at the time it had mattered . Or I enjoyed it , whatever . Those were the years when everything mattered , really . We had nothing but each other . We were on our own , growing most of our food , making a lot of our tools , even our clothes , with all the kids growing up . We all grew up together . It matters , in a time like that , whether you can make your agriculture work or not . Then things changed , as they will , and the kids went off to school , people moved ; the whole feeling changed . It always happens that way . Now of course it 's still a beautiful place to live , but the feeling from those years is hard to recapture , especially given the cold , and the kids gone . I now think that kibbutz is a name for a certain time , a time in the life of a settlement , early on , when it is as much an adventure as it is a home . Later you have to reconceptualize it as a different kind of experience , as home ground or something , the whole shape of a life . But I remember the first time we had a big party and invited the neighbors , and fed everybody with only the food we had been able to grow there in our new gardens , there in our new homes . It was a good feeling . It was a good place to live . Whot Matters 4 For a long time Peter Clayborne worked in hydrology . His co - op was called Noachian Aquifer Redistribution , or NAR . He joined because he got interested as an ecologist in the work , and because he was deeply involved at the time with a woman who had been in the co - op since her teens . Her seniority was one of the things that led to problems in their relationship later , though clearly that was only a symptom rather than a cause . Seniority in their co - op created some of the usual advantages in "
128619	129461	129463	129463	I	0	" but the interests of everyone in the organization were substantially the same . Potential members were chosen for invitation by selection committees , and sometimes had to join a waiting list if the co - op was stable in size . Peter had waited for four years before resignations , retirements , and a few accidental deaths opened up a spot . After that he was a member and , like everyone else , working twenty hours a week , voting on all membership policy issues , and receiving an income share and insurances . The pay scale ran the full legal magnitude , based on work time , contributions to efficiency and productivity , and seniority . He started at twenty percent max , like everyone , and found his needs were satisfied . Some years he sank to the minimum recompense , which supported him both while working and in his time off , which was six months every m - year . It was a good life . But he and his partner slowly drifted apart , and then broke up . It was n't Peter 's idea . After that he took a series of sabbaticals and did various things on them , all away from Argyre and the membership of NAR . He staffed for the duma in Mangala ; he lived on a township in What Matters 263 the northern sea ; he planted orchards on Lunae Planitia . Everywhere he was haunted by the memory of his partner from NAR . Eventually time passed and had its way with him ; not so much a matter of forgetting as of bleaching , or numbing . We look at the past through the wrong end of the telescope , he thought one day ; eventually the things we can see in there become simply too small to hurt us . It was a cold northern spring , orchards budding and blossoming all around him for as far as the eye could see , and all of a sudden he felt free of his past , launched on a new life . He decided to take a tour he had long been contemplating along the south rims of the great Marineris canyons — Ius , Melas , Coprates , and Eos . This famous long walk was to be a mark for him , a celebration of his transition to a new existence . When he finished it he would return to Argyre and NAR , and decide then whether he could continue living and working there or not . Near the end of this trek , which turned out to be a hard slog through many deep drifts of snow , though the views down into the canyons were superb , of course — he came on a Swiss alpine hut , set right on the rim overlooking Coprates Chasma , at the Dover Gate . Like most Swiss huts it was actually a very extensive stone hotel and restaurant , with a rimside terrace that would seat hundreds , but located all by itself in the wilderness , away from any roads or pistes . Nevertheless on that evening there were a lot of people there — walkers , climbers , fliers — and the terrace cafe tables were full . Peter passed through the crowd and went directly to the rail of the flagged terrace , to have a look down . Directly below the hut the great canyon narrowed , and the scar of the old flood marked the whole floor of it , from wall to wall . A gray remnant glacier still lay in the lowest trough of the canyon , all covered with gravel and pocked with potholes and meltponds and fallen seracs . The cliff of the canyon 's opposing wall stood massive and stratified , and the stupendous gulf of empty air shimmered and glittered insubstantially in the late - afternoon light , with the hut standing over it isolate and small . Perched on the edge of a world . In the hut 's restaurant it was even more crowded than the terrace , and so Peter went back outside . He was content to wait ; the late sun was illuminating clouds passing just over their heads , turning them to swirling masses of pink spun glass . No one noticed or cared about a solitary observer standing at the rail ; indeed there were others along it doing the same thing . Near sunset it began to get cold , but the hikers who passed by there 264 THE MARTIANS were used to cold , and dressed for it , and all the tables on the terrace remained full . Finally Peter went to the headwaiter to get on a waiting list , and the waiter pointed to one of the two - person tables right on the railing , down near the end of the terrace , occupied by a single man .

131591	131607	131428	131430	268 THE MARTIANS	721	" Well , the thing is , it 's more trouble than it 's worth . "
131608	131619	131428	131430	268 THE MARTIANS	721	" Ah yeah . Getting them to go back home . "
131620	131640	131428	131430	268 THE MARTIANS	721	" Yeah , sure . Or not getting to go home with them ! I mean , either way .... "
131641	131651	131428	131430	268 THE MARTIANS	721	" Well , that way 's worse , clearly . "
131652	131673	131428	131430	268 THE MARTIANS	721	" Yes it is . I remember the first time it happened . I was young , she was young .... "
131674	131679	131428	131430	268 THE MARTIANS	721	" It was love . "
131680	131741	131428	131430	268 THE MARTIANS	721	" It was ! I mean really . But what were we supposed to do ? She was a student , I was a guide . I could n't just quit , even if I wanted to . And I did n't . I could n't leave the land . And she could n't leave her work either . So ... "
131742	131770	131428	131430	268 THE MARTIANS	721	" That 's tough . You hear about that kind of thing a lot . People 's work taking them in different directions , what they do — "
131771	131776	131428	131430	268 THE MARTIANS	721	" What they are ! "
131777	131793	131428	131430	268 THE MARTIANS	721	" Right . Keeping them apart even when they , when the feeling between them ... "
131794	131799	131428	131430	268 THE MARTIANS	721	" It 's hard . "
131803	131830	131428	131430	268 THE MARTIANS	721	" It was hard . That time it — I do n't know . It was hard . Nothing since has really ever felt the same . "
131834	131841	131428	131430	268 THE MARTIANS	721	" You never saw her again ? "
131842	131939	131428	131430	268 THE MARTIANS	721	" I did , actually . We ran into each other , and then after that we 've What Matters 269 stayed in touch , sort of . I see her every few years . It 's always the same . She 's great , she really is . She even got into canyon guiding herself , for a while there . And I can still see why I felt that way about her , so long ago . And she even seems to feel sort of the same . But , you know .. . . "
131940	131943	131428	131430	268 THE MARTIANS	721	" No ? "
131944	131978	131428	131430	268 THE MARTIANS	721	" Well , one or the other of us is always partnered with someone else ! It never fails . She 's been single when I 've been partnered , and vice versa . "
131985	131990	131428	131430	268 THE MARTIANS	721	" It keeps happening . "
131991	131997	131428	131430	268 THE MARTIANS	721	" I know that story . "
131998	132001	131428	131430	268 THE MARTIANS	721	" Yeah ? "
132002	132018	131428	131430	268 THE MARTIANS	721	" Yeah . A long time ago . Like yours , sort of , though ... "
132019	132024	131428	131430	268 THE MARTIANS	721	" Someone you met ? "
132025	132043	131428	131430	268 THE MARTIANS	721	" Someone I grew up with , sort of . In Zygote . You know Jackie Boone ? "
132044	132048	131428	131430	268 THE MARTIANS	721	" Not really . "
132049	132071	131428	131430	268 THE MARTIANS	721	" Well , when she was a kid , she thought I was — well , I was it for her . "
132075	132122	131428	131430	268 THE MARTIANS	721	" But she was just a kid . Even when she had grown up a bit , I thought she was just a kid . Then one time years later I ran into her when I was — when I had been alone a long time . "
132126	132239	131428	131430	268 THE MARTIANS	721	" And she was — grown - up . She 'd been living in Sabishii and Dorsa Brevia . She had become one of the great ones . A power . And still interested . So finally I was ready , you know , and we got together , and it was incredible . I was ... I was in love , sure . But the thing was , she was n't really interested anymore . Not in the same way . It had just been settling old business . Like doing a climb just to show you can , but without the feeling you had when you could n't do it . "
132240	132245	131428	131430	268 THE MARTIANS	721	" People do that . "
132246	132305	131428	131430	268 THE MARTIANS	721	" All the time . So , well , I got over it . She 's become , I do n't know , kind of strange these days anyway . But I think that if we had ever been in the same place , you know , in the same frame of mind , at the same time .... "
132306	132324	131428	131430	268 THE MARTIANS	721	" Sure . That 's just it with me and Eileen . I think we might have ... "
132325	132328	131428	131430	268 THE MARTIANS	721	" Yeah . "
132344	132348	131428	131430	268 THE MARTIANS	721	" Lost chances . "
132349	132357	131428	131430	268 THE MARTIANS	721	" Right . The fate of chance . "
132358	132364	131428	131430	268 THE MARTIANS	721	" Some fate is character . "
132365	132456	131428	131430	268 THE MARTIANS	721	" Sure . But most fate is fate . It 's what picks you up and carries you off . Who you meet by accident , what happens — what you feel inside , no matter what you think . And it affects everything . Everything ! 270 THE MARTIANS Every thing . People argue about politics , and when people write history books they talk about politics , and policy , the reasons why people did this or that — but it 's always the personal stuff that mattered . "
132457	132484	131428	131430	268 THE MARTIANS	721	" It 's always the stuff they do n't write about . The stuff they ca n't write about . The look in someone 's eye . "
132485	132494	131428	131430	268 THE MARTIANS	721	" Right , the way something catches you .... "
132495	132503	131428	131430	268 THE MARTIANS	721	" The way it carries you away . "
132504	132516	131428	131430	268 THE MARTIANS	721	" Like falling in love . Whatever the hell that means . "
132517	132532	131428	131430	268 THE MARTIANS	721	" That 's it , sure . Falling in love , being loved back — "
132533	132537	131428	131430	268 THE MARTIANS	721	" Or not . "
132538	132548	131428	131430	268 THE MARTIANS	721	" Right , or not ! And everything changes . "
132549	132552	131428	131430	268 THE MARTIANS	721	" Everything . "
132553	132585	131428	131430	268 THE MARTIANS	721	" And no one knows why ! And later on , or from anywhere on the outside , they look at your story and they say that story makes no sense . "
132586	132593	131428	131430	268 THE MARTIANS	721	" When if you only knew — "
132594	132601	131428	131430	268 THE MARTIANS	721	" Then it would make sense . "
132602	132608	131428	131430	268 THE MARTIANS	721	" Yes . Perfect sense . "
132609	132622	131428	131430	268 THE MARTIANS	721	" It would be the story of the heart , every time . "
132623	132636	131428	131430	268 THE MARTIANS	721	" A history of the emotions . If you could do it . "
132637	132646	131428	131430	268 THE MARTIANS	721	" It would be the heart 's story . "
132647	132650	131428	131430	268 THE MARTIANS	721	" Yes . "
132651	132654	131428	131430	268 THE MARTIANS	721	" Yes . "
132655	132658	131428	131430	268 THE MARTIANS	721	" Yes . "
132659	132683	131428	131430	268 THE MARTIANS	721	" Which means . .. when you 're trying to decide what to do — in the here and now , you know .... "
132684	132687	133723	133723	he	510	" Yes . "
133738	133743	133723	133723	he	510	" Data Enrichment Method . "
133744	133829	133728	133728	Berkina	747	" Say you do an experiment to see if sounds can be detected at various decibel levels , and you have your data in a table . Then since you want more data but do n't actually want to do more experiments , you assume that if a sound is n't heard at decibel level a , it would n't be heard at any lower levels either , and so you add the result of test a to all the trials at lower decibels . "
133830	133835	133723	133723	he	510	" Uh - oh . "
133836	133864	133723	133723	he	510	" Then say you 're trying to prove that coin tosses are more likely to turn up heads the higher the altitude you make the toss at — "
133865	133868	133895	133895	he	510	" What ? "
133869	133893	133972	133972	he	510	" That 's your hypothesis , and you make your trial and arrange your data in the same kind of table , see here "
133901	133970	133972	133972	he	510	" and it looks a little ambiguous , sure , but you just use the data enrichment method as described with the decibels , so that every time you get heads , you add it to all the tests higher up the stairs , and there you have it — the higher on the stairs you toss the coin , the more heads you get ! Very convincing ! "

134828	134832	134810	134810	Sax	510	" How so ? "
134833	134860	134810	134810	Sax	510	" Well , we are just animals , mostly . But we have a consciousness which sets us apart , because we have language and memory . "
134861	134865	134810	134810	Sax	510	" Those exist . "
134866	134934	134943	134943	Maya	496	" True , but the only reason they work is because of the past . We remember the past , we learn from it , and everything we have learned is in the past . And the past , being past , properly speaking does not exist . Its presence in us is an illusion only . So the thing that makes us human does not exist ! "
134935	134942	134943	134943	Maya	496	" I 've always maintained that , "
134946	134954	134975	134975	Sax	510	" But not for the same reason . "

135841	135860	135821	135821	Sax	510	" It is otherwise unconfirmable by experiment . It is the beauty of the mathematics that confirms it . "

139010	139028	139094	139094	his	4403	" Then the ranges could have been somewhat straightened out in the deformation of the Elysium bulge . "
139097	139122	140311	140311	Roger	550	" The andesite indicating tectonic action is younger than that . The Phlegras are early Noachian . A pre - Big Hit big hit . "
140295	140310	140311	140311	Roger	550	" I 'm just dropping by to pick up the rest of our crew , "
140314	140328	140336	140336	Stephan	763	" A couple of young friends of mine are going to join us . "
140329	140335	140336	140336	Stephan	763	" Which one is this ? "
140339	140345	140371	140371	He	550	" This is the Altamira . "
140377	140416	140716	140716	They	4458	" I do n't intend to go up there , by the way , that 's an all - day trip no matter how you do it . My friends should be down here onshore to meet us . "
140710	140715	140734	140734	Roger	550	" Here they are . "
140729	140733	140734	140734	Roger	550	" Hi all , "
140737	140769	140778	140778	Freya	692	" Eileen , this is Freya Ahmet and Jean - Claude Bayer . They 're going to be joining us . Freya , Jean - Claude , this is Eileen Monday . "
140770	140777	140787	140787	She	4474	" We have heard of you , "
140803	140823	141002	141002	she	551	" That 's Hans and Frances behind us , down the path there arguing . Get used to that . "
140996	141001	141002	141002	she	551	" Look at this , "
141017	141036	141039	141039	his	550	" Is it lichen ? Moss ? Is it alive ? It looks like it might be alive . "
141051	141059	141039	141039	his	550	" Moss , I think . Dead . "
141069	141113	141143	141143	he	550	" I 'm so tired of finding dead plants , dead animals . The last dozen times out I 've not seen a single living thing . I mean winterkill is winterkill , but this is ridiculous . The whole world is dying ! "
141130	141142	141143	141143	he	550	" I suppose there was never enough sunlight to begin with , "
141159	141180	141188	141188	She	551	" People wanted it and so they did it anyway . But reality is n't interested in what people want . "
141184	141187	141188	141188	She	551	" No . "
141196	141220	141252	141252	Eileen	551	" Are you sure this is n't a lichen ? It 's black , but it looks like it 's still alive somehow . "
141247	141251	141252	141252	Eileen	551	" Fringe lichen ? "
141255	141259	141270	141270	He	550	" Frond lichen ? "
141260	141269	141252	141252	Eileen	551	" Moss , I think . Dead moss . "
141293	141326	141252	141252	Eileen	551	" No doubt there are lichens alive , though . And Freya and Jean - Claude say the subnivean environment is quite lively still . Very robust . Protected from the elements . "
141335	141340	141270	141270	He	550	" Uh - huh . "
141341	141350	141252	141252	Eileen	551	" Hey . Better than nothing , right ? "
141351	141361	141370	141370	They	4486	" Right . But this moss here was exposed . "
141362	141369	141384	141384	He	550	" Right . And therefore dead . "
141387	141422	141384	141384	He	550	" I 'm having a deja vu . This happened before , right ? A long time ago we found some little living thing together , only it was dead . It happened before ! "
141428	141439	141476	141476	He	550	" You tell me . You 're the memory man . "
141440	141475	141476	141476	He	550	" But I ca n't quite get it . It 's more like deja vu . Well , but maybe ... 290 THE MARTIANS maybe on that fir^t trip , when we first met ? "
141496	141503	141511	141511	Eileen	551	" Some little snails or something . "
141504	141510	141511	141511	Eileen	551	" But could that be ? "
141514	141535	141540	141540	He	550	" I thought we met when I was still in college . The terraforming had barely started then , right ? "
141536	141539	141540	141540	He	550	" True . "
141543	141561	141567	141567	He	550	" Well , there was lichen from the start , it was the first thing they propagated . "
141562	141566	141567	141567	He	550	" But snails ? "
141570	141583	141540	141540	He	550	" That 's what I seem to remember . You do n't ? "
141584	141599	141605	141605	He	550	" No way . Just whatever you 've told me since , you know . "
141600	141604	141605	141605	He	550	" Oh well . "
141612	141621	141678	141678	JeanClaude	780	" Maybe it was just a deja vu . "
141665	141677	141678	141678	JeanClaude	780	" No , please , that is why we are here , "
141685	141697	141898	141898	Frances	623	" I very much like to be cooking the big meals . "
141890	141897	141898	141898	Frances	623	" You do n't know that , "
141901	141936	141944	141944	Hans	619	" You radiate those same organisms in the lab , or even expose them in space labs , and you do n't get the mutations or the collapses we 're seeing on the ground . "
141937	141943	141960	141960	Frances	623	" Interaction with ground chemicals , "
141947	141959	141962	141962	her	623	" Sometimes I think everything is simply getting salted to death . "
141965	142017	142075	142075	he	4503	" These are different problems , and there 's A Martian Romance 291 no sign of synergistic effects when they 're combined . You 're just listing possibilities , Hans , admit it . You 're throwing them out there , but no one knows . The etiology is not understood . "
142085	142127	142391	142391	Hans	619	" Well , when you have a list of possibilities as long as this one , you do n't have to have synergy among them . Just a simple addition of factors might do it . Everything having its particular effect . "
142385	142390	142426	142426	Frances	623	" We can regroup , "
142400	142425	142426	142426	Frances	623	" If we pursued the heavy - industrial methods aggressively , the ocean would melt from below and we 'd be back in business . "
142433	142442	142391	142391	Hans	619	" Bombs in the regolith , you mean . "
142443	142541	142549	142549	Frances	623	" Bombs below the regolith . So that we get the heat , but trap the radiation . That and some of the other methods might do it . A flying lens to focus some of the mirrors ' light , heat the surface with focused sunlight . Then bring in some nitrogen from Titan . Direct a few 292 THE MARTIANS comets to unpopulated areas , or aerobrake them so that they burn up in the atmosphere . That would thicken things up fast . And more halocarbon factories , we let that go too soon . "
142542	142548	142549	142549	Frances	623	" It sounds pretty industrial , "
142552	142572	142580	142580	Roger	550	" Of course it is . Terraforming is an industrial process , at least partly . We forgot that . "
142573	142579	142580	142580	Roger	550	" I do n't know , "
142583	142624	142632	142632	Hans	619	" Maybe it would be best to keep pursuing the biological methods . Just regroup , you know , and send another wave out there . It 's longer , but , you know . Less violence to the landscape . "
142625	142631	142647	142647	He	550	" Ecopoesis wo n't work , "
142635	142646	142647	142647	He	550	" It does n't trap enough heat in the biosphere . "
142651	142662	142669	142669	Roger	550	" This is as far as ecopoiesis will take you . "
142663	142668	142669	142669	Roger	550	" Maybe for now , "
142672	142701	142709	142709	Roger	550	" Ah yes . You are unconcerned , of course . But I suppose you 're happy about the crash anyway , eh ? Being such a red ? "
142702	142708	142709	142709	Roger	550	" Hey , come on , "
142712	142724	142736	142736	Roger	550	" How could I be happy ? I was a sailor . "
142725	142735	142744	142744	Eileen	551	" But you used to want the terraforming gone . "
142750	142766	142669	142669	Roger	550	" That was a long time ago . Besides , the terraforming is n't gone now anyway"—gesturing
142769	142774	142709	142709	Roger	550	ice—"it 's only sleeping . "
142775	142778	142779	142779	Arthur	668	" See , "
142782	142789	142669	142669	Roger	550	" you do want it gone . "
142790	142801	142669	142669	Roger	550	" No I do n't , I 'm telling you . "
142802	142813	142821	142821	Roger	550	" Then why are you so damn happy these days ? "
142814	142820	142821	142821	Roger	550	" I 'm not happy , "
142827	142844	142847	142847	his	668	" I 'm just not sad . I do n't think the situation calls for sadness . "
142859	142883	142847	142847	his	668	" The world freezes and this is not a reason for sadness . I shudder to think what it would take for you ! "
142884	142891	142847	142847	his	668	" It would take something sad ! "
142892	142905	142912	142912	Roger	550	" But you 're not a red , no of course not . "
142906	142911	142912	142912	Roger	550	" I 'm not ! "
142925	142974	142982	142982	Hans	619	" I was a sailor , I tell you . Look , if the situation were as bad as you all are saying , then Freya and Jean - Claude would be worried too , right ? But they 're not . Ask them and you 'll see . "
142975	142981	143002	143002	Roger	550	" They are simply young , "
142996	143001	143002	143002	Roger	550	" That 's right , "
143005	143015	143024	143024	Stephan	763	" And it 's a short - term problem . "
143027	143039	143079	143079	They	906	" What about you , Arthur ? What would you do ? "
143044	143078	143110	143111	Old friends	2371	" What , me ? I have no idea . It 's not for me to say , anyway . You know me . I do n't like telling people what to do . "
143089	143109	143275	143275	Roger	550	" But you know , if you did just direct a couple of little comets right into the ocean ... "
143263	143274	143285	143285	Eileen	551	" A beautiful day 's sail , was n't it ? "
143278	143284	143289	143289	she	551	" Yes , it was , "
143306	143326	143285	143285	Eileen	551	" What did you think about what Hans was saying last night , about taking another bash at it ? "
143327	143338	143289	143289	she	551	" You hear a lot of people talking that way . "
143339	143343	143285	143285	Eileen	551	" But you ? "
143344	143367	143368	143368	He	550	" Well , I do n't know . I do n't like a lot of the methods they talk about . But — "
143371	143383	143289	143289	she	551	" What I like or do n't like does n't matter . "
143384	143387	143289	143289	she	551	" Hmm . "
143408	143442	143453	143453	Eileen	551	" And you say the youngsters are n't much interested either . But I ca n't see why not . You 'd think they 'd want terraforming to be working more than anyone . "
143443	143452	143453	143453	Eileen	551	" They think they have lots of time . "
143458	143464	143496	143496	He	550	" They may be right . "
143465	143495	143496	143496	He	550	" That 's true , they may . But not us . I sometimes think we 're sad not so much because of the crash as the quick decline . "
143508	143520	143453	143453	Eileen	551	" We 're two hundred and fifty years old , Eileen . "
143521	143526	143496	143496	He	550	" Two hundred forty . "
143527	143543	143496	143496	He	550	" Yeah yeah . But there 's no one alive older than two - sixty . "
143544	143548	143605	143605	someone	4880	" I know . "
143608	143616	143699	143699	He	4530	" It 's like my longevity treatments . "
143636	143698	143786	143786	Freya	692	" Well . There you have it . If I were twenty I would n't worry about the crash either . Whereas for us it 's very likely the last Mars we 'll know . But , you know . In the end it does n't matter what kind of Mars you like best . They 're all better than nothing . "
143792	143798	143786	143786	Freya	692	" You left us behind . "
143799	143815	143786	143786	Freya	692	" What ? Shit ! What the hell were you doing out of the boat ? "
143816	143827	143838	143838	Roger	550	" We were down on the ice , fooling around . "
143828	143837	143838	143838	Roger	550	" For Christ 's sake , you two . "
143848	143857	143865	143867	Jean - Claude	777	" And what , you 're done now ? "
143858	143864	143885	143885	Roger	550	" None of your business , "
143874	143884	143885	143885	Roger	550	" But you 're ready to be picked up , "
143888	143895	143838	143838	Roger	550	" Yes , we are ready . "
143896	143923	143885	143885	Roger	550	" Okay , well , shit . Just hold put there . It 'll take a while to beat back up to you in this wind . "
143924	143948	143958	143958	Roger	550	" That 's all right . We have our warm clothes on , and a ground pad . We will wait for you . "
143949	143957	144284	144284	Roger	550	" As if you have any choice ! "
144279	144283	144300	144300	Roger	550	" Coming about , "
144303	144313	144424	144424	Roger	550	" I 'm going to wear about , folks . "
144431	144438	144453	144453	Roger	550	" There they are , see ? "
144445	144452	144455	144455	his	550	" Sitting down I take it . "
144458	144472	144478	144478	Roger	550	" They 're still mostly over the horizon . That 's their heads . "
144473	144477	144488	144488	He	550	" You hope . "
144493	144551	144572	144572	Arthur	668	" We 'll have to come up on them slow . The radar only sees to the horizon , and even standing up it wo n't catch them farther than six k away , and we 're going about a hundred fifty k an hour . So we 'll have to do it by our APS positions . "
144566	144571	144583	144583	Roger	550	" You could always , "
144588	144594	144694	144694	Roger	550	" It should be doable . "
144688	144693	144741	144741	He	550	" Hey you guys , "
144701	144740	145732	145732	Roger	550	" I 'm closing on you , I 'll come up from downwind , wave your arms and keep an eye out , I 'll try to come up on your left side as slow as I can . "
145724	145731	145743	145743	She	551	" Beautiful , is n't it ? "
145763	145770	145856	145856	Roger	550	" It 's dead , Roger . "
145771	145776	145789	145789	she	551	" What 's that ? "
145780	145788	145789	145789	she	551	" ' The darkness grew apace , ' "
145797	145813	145743	145743	She	551	" ' A cold wind began to blow in freshening gusts from the east . ' "
145814	145821	145828	145828	she	551	" What 's that you say ? "
145822	145827	145828	145828	she	551	" The Time Machine , "
145831	145851	145856	145856	Roger	550	" The end of the world . ' It would be hard to convey the stillness of it . ' "
145852	145855	145874	145874	He	550	" Ah , "
145867	145873	145874	145874	He	550	" Still the English major . "
145877	145903	145828	145828	she	551	" All these years pass and we 're still just what we always were . You 're an English major from the University of Mars . "
145904	145907	145874	145874	He	550	" Yes . "
145930	145946	145874	145874	He	550	" But it 's all over now , do n't you see ? It 's all dead"—she
145947	145953	145980	145980	Roger	550	gestures—"everything we tried to do ! "
145975	145979	146038	146038	Roger	550	" Not so , "
146046	146064	146092	146092	Freya	692	" Now listen , Eileen , listen to what they say . Just watch them and listen . "
146085	146091	146092	146092	Freya	692	" It 's so beautiful ! "
146095	146099	146104	146104	Roger	550	" So pure ! "
146100	146103	146104	146104	Roger	550	" Look , "
146107	146136	146179	146179	he	777	" do n't you worry everything will all go away , just like this forest here ? Mars become unlivable ? Do n't you believe in the crash ? "
146172	146178	146179	146179	he	777	" It never goes backward , "
146186	146213	146147	146147	her	4602	" You see all that water out there , and the sun in the sky . And Mars , the most beautiful planet in the world . "
146214	146226	146147	146147	her	4602	" But the crash , Jean - Claude . The crash . "

146466	146495	146556	146556	he	777	" It could get colder , the atmosphere could freeze out , everything in the world could die like these trees here . Nothing left alive at all . "
