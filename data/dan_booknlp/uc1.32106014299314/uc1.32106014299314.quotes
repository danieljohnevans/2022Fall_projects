864	954	860	861	the father	256	“ Why do you let your heart hang on the child ? They 're coming to take her away next month . For good . Might as well bury her and be done with it . What 's the good of clinging to one you 're bound to lose ? She 's no good to us . If they 'd pay for her when they took her , that would be something , but they wo n't . They 'll take her and that 's an end of it . ”

3327	3329	3371	3371	she	250	“ Arha "
3346	3356	3332	3332	she	250	“ Tell me how I was chosen , Manan . "
3357	3368	3371	3371	she	250	“ Oh , you know all that , little one . "
3398	3628	3394	3394	she	250	“ Yes , I know . At the death of the One Priestess of the Tombs of Atuan , the ceremonies of burial and purification are completed within one month by the moon 's calendar . After this certain of the Priestesses and Wardens of the Place of the Tombs go forth across the desert , among the towns and villages of Atuan , seeking and asking . They seek the girl - child who was born on the night of the Priestess ' death . When they find such a child , they wait and they watch . The child must be sound of body and of mind , and as it grows it must not suffer from rickets nor the smallpox nor any deformity , nor become blind . If it reaches the age of five years unblemished , then it is known that the body of the child is indeed the new body of the Priestess who died . And the child is made known to the Godking in Awabath , and brought here to her Temple and instructed for a year . And at the year 's end she is taken to the Hall of the Throne and her name is given back to those who are her Masters , the Nameless Ones : for she is the nameless one , the Priestess Ever Reborn . ”
3704	3713	3699	3699	she	363	" Now tell me how I was chosen ! "
3721	3900	3901	3901	Manan	165	“ We left here , going north and west , in the third day of the moon 's waxing ; for Arha - that - was had died in the third day of the last moon . And first we went to Tenacbah , which is a great city , though those who 've seen both say it 's no more to Awabath than a flea to a cow . But it 's big enough for me , there must be ten hundred houses in Tenacbah ! And we went on to Gar . But nobody in those cities had a baby girl born to them on the third day of the moon a month before , there were some had boys , but boys wo n't do . . . . So we went into the hill country north of Gar , to the towns and villages . That 's my own land . I was born in the hills there , where the rivers run , and the land is green . Not in this desert . ”
3939	4486	3927	3927	he	165	“ And so we found and spoke to all those who were parents of babies born in the last months . And some would lie to us . ' Oh yes , surely our baby girl was born on the moon 's third day ! For poor folk , you know , are often glad to get rid of girl - babies . And there were others who were so poor , living in lonely huts in the valleys of the hills , that they kept no count of days and scarce knew how to tell the turn of time , so they could not say for certain how old their baby was . But we could always come at the truth , by asking long enough . But it was slow work . At last we found a girl - child , in a village of ten houses , in the orchard - vales westward of Entat . Eight months old she was , THE TOMBS OF ATUAN 14 W so long had we been looking . But she had been born on the night that the Priestess of the Tombs had died , and within the very hour of her death . And she was a fine baby , sitting up on her mother 's knee and looking with bright eyes at all of us , crowding into the one room of the house like bats into a cave ! The father was a poor man . He tended the apple trees of the rich man 's orchard , and had nothing of his own but five children and a goat . Not even the house was his . So there we all crowded in , and you could tell by the way the priestesses looked at the baby and spoke among themselves that they thought they had found the Reborn One at last . And the mother could tell this too . She held the baby and never said a word . Well , so , the next day we came back . And look here ! The little bright - eyed baby lying in a cot of rushes weeping and screaming , and all over its body weals and red rashes of fever , and the mother wailing louder than the baby , ' Oh ! Oh ! My babe hath the Witch - Fingers on her ! ' That 's how she said it ; the smallpox she meant . In my village , too , they called it the Witch - Fingers . But Kossil , she who is now the High Priestess of the Godking , she went to the cot and picked up the baby . The others had all drawn back , and I with them ; I do n't value my life very high , but who enters a house where smallpox is ? But she had no fear , not that one . She picked up the baby and said , ' It has no fever . ' And she spat on her finger and rubbed at the red marks , and they came off . They were only berry juice . The poor silly mother had thought to fool us and keep her child ! "
4504	4634	4640	4640	Arha	166	“ So , her husband beat her , for he was afraid of the wrath of the priestesses . And soon we came back to the desert , but each year one of the people of the place would return to the village among the apple orchards , and see how the child 15 The Wall Around the Place got on . So five years passed , and then Thar and Kossil made the journey , with the Temple guards , and soldiers of the red helmet sent by the Godking to escort them safely . They brought the child back here , for it was indeed the Priestess of the Tombs reborn , and here it belonged . And who was the child , eh , little one ? "
4635	4638	4640	4640	Arha	166	“ Me , ”
4667	4685	4664	4664	she	166	“ What did the ... the mother do , when they came to take the child away ? ”
4926	4932	4916	4916	people	386	“ You may come in , "
5279	5287	5272	5272	Mebbeth	173	" Be still , you screeching fool ! ”
6747	6751	6743	6743	Arha	166	“ Come on ! ”
6812	6821	6823	6823	Penthe	175	" I 'd like to see the sea , ”
6825	6829	6831	6831	Arha	166	" What for ? ”
6973	7002	7263	7263	Arha	166	“ Oh , I do n't know what for . I 'd just like to see something different . It 's always the same here . Nothing happens . ”
7003	7012	7014	7014	Arha	166	“ All that happens everywhere , begins here , ”
7016	7034	7014	7014	Arha	166	“ Oh , I know . ... But I 'd like to see some of it happening ! "
7069	7256	7048	7048	She	175	“ You know , I used to live by the sea when I was little . Our village was right behind the dunes , and we used to go down and play on the beach sometimes . Once I remember we saw a fleet of ships going by , way out at sea . We ran and told the village and everybody came to see . The ships looked like dragons with red wings . Some of them had real necks , with dragon heads . They came sailing by Atuan , but they were n't Kargish ships . They came from the west , from the Inner Lands , the headman said . Everybody came down to watch them . I think they were afraid they might land . They just went by , nobody knew where they were going . Maybe to make war in Karego - At . But think of it , they really came from the sorcerers ' islands , where all the people are the color of dirt and they can all cast a spell on you easy as winking . ”
7257	7262	7263	7263	Arha	166	“ Not on me , ”
7267	7293	7263	7263	Arha	166	“ I would n't have looked at them . They 're vile accursed sorcerers . How dare they sail so close to the Holy Land ? ”
7294	7358	7048	7048	She	175	“ Oh , well , I suppose the Godking will conquer them some day and make them all slaves . But I wish I could see the sea again . There used to be little octopuses in the tide pools , and if you shouted ' Boo ! ' at them they turned all white.—There comes that old Manan , looking for you . ”
7433	7444	7445	7445	Arha	166	" Slide down part way on the men 's side , ”
7487	7495	7497	7497	Arha	166	" Hoo ! Hoo ! Potato face ! ”
7515	7519	7510	7512	The heavy tread	530	“ Ho there , ”
7525	7531	7510	7512	The heavy tread	530	“ Little one ? Arha ? ”
7539	7547	7535	7535	Manan	165	" Hoo - oo ! Potato face ! "
7548	7554	7555	7555	Penthe	175	“ Hoo , potato belly ! ”
7569	7573	7555	7555	Penthe	175	" Somebody there ? ”
7576	7584	7585	7586	the eunuch	531	" Oh well , well , well , ”
7632	7643	7628	7628	Arha	166	“ The stupid old bellwether , following me around everywhere ! "
7644	7649	7650	7650	Penthe	175	" He has to , ”
7654	7664	7650	7650	Penthe	175	“ It 's his job , looking after you . "
7665	7710	7628	7628	Arha	166	“ Those I serve look after me . I please them ; I need please nobody else . These old women and half - men , these people 23 The Wall Around the Place should leave me alone . I am the One Priestess ! "
7718	7721	7722	7722	she	175	“ Oh , ”
7726	7736	7722	7722	she	175	“ oh , I know you are , Arha — ”
7738	7755	7650	7650	Penthe	175	" Then they should let me be . And not order me about all the time ! "
7795	7809	7810	7810	she	175	" You 'll get to give the orders pretty soon , you know , "
7817	7874	7810	7810	she	175	“ In two more years we wo n't be children any more . We 'll be fourteen . I 'll go into the Godking 's temple , and things will be about the same for me . But you 'll really be the High Priestess then . Even Kossil and Thar will have to obey you . ”
7902	7909	7910	7910	Penthe	175	" We ought to go back , ”
7913	7916	7910	7910	Penthe	175	" No . "
7917	7937	7967	7967	her	175	“ But the weaving mistress might tell Thar . And soon it 'll be time for the Nine Chants . ”
7938	7949	7967	7967	her	175	“ I 'm staying here . You stay , too . "
7950	7963	7964	7964	Penthe	175	“ They wo n't punish you , but they will punish me , ”
8158	8164	8165	8165	She	172	“ Take off your gown . ”
8215	8228	8229	8229	Kossil	172	“ If you are found climbing over the Men 's Wall again , ”
8232	8252	8229	8229	Kossil	172	“ there will be very much worse things than this happen to you . Do you understand , Penthe ? ”
8266	8269	8263	8263	Penthe	175	“ Yes , ”
8314	8334	8309	8309	Thar	167	“ It is not fitting that you be seen climbing and running with other girls . You are Arha . "
8343	8363	8309	8309	Thar	167	" It is better that you do only what is needful for you to do . You are Arha . ”
8420	8435	8409	8409	she	364	“ You are Arha . There is nothing left . It was all eaten . "
8436	8442	8443	8444	the girl	551	“ It was all eaten , ”
8663	8670	8657	8657	She	551	" Ho there , little one ! ”
8671	8674	8675	8675	she	551	“ Manan , ”
8694	8699	8690	8690	his	569	" Were you punished ? ”
8700	8707	8657	8657	She	551	" I ca n't be punished . ”
8708	8719	8657	8657	She	551	" No . . . . That 's so . ... "
8720	8732	8733	8733	He	569	“ They ca n't punish me . They do n't dare . ”
8775	8786	8787	8787	she	551	“ They ca n't touch me . I am Arha , ”
8823	8840	8841	8841	She	551	“ There , there . THE TOMBS OF ATUAN 26 Little honeycomb , little girl . ... "
8877	8882	8883	8883	he	569	" Poor little one , ”
8909	8917	8904	8904	He	569	“ All right now , little one ? ”
8983	8986	8976	8976	she	1581	" Mistress . ”
8987	8994	8976	8976	she	1581	“ What is it , Kossil ? ”
8995	9056	9057	9058	The girl	551	“ I have been permitted to look after certain matters perTHE TOMBS OF ATUAN 28 taining to the Domain of the Nameless Ones , until now . If you so desire , it is now time for you to learn , and see , and take charge of these matters , which you have not yet remembered in this life . ”
9116	9120	9108	9108	She	551	“ The Labyrinth ? ”
9121	9139	9108	9108	She	551	“ We will not enter the Labyrinth . But it will be necessary to cross the Undertomb . "
9178	9182	9168	9169	The girl	551	“ Very well . ”
9524	9528	9529	9529	he	165	“ Long ago , "
9532	9757	9529	9529	he	165	“ you know , little one , before our four lands joined together into an empire , before there was a Godking over us all , there were a lot of lesser kings , princes , chiefs . They were always quarreling with each other . And they 'd come here to settle their quarrels . That was how it was , they 'd come from our land Atuan , and from Karego - At , and Atnini , and even from Hur - at - Hur , all the chiefs and princes with their servants and their armies . And they 'd ask you what to do . And you 'd go before the Empty Throne , and give them the counsel of the Nameless Ones . Well , that was long ago . After a while the Priest - Kings came to rule all of Karego - At , and soon they were ruling Atuan ; and now for four or five lifetimes of men the Godkings have ruled all the four lands together , and made them an empire . And so things are changed . The Godking can put down the unruly chiefs , and settle all the quarrels himself . And being a god , you see , he does n't have to consult the Nameless Ones very often . "
9838	9856	9857	9857	she	166	“ The powers of the Godking are much less than the powers of the Ones I serve , ”
9862	9934	9857	9857	she	166	“ Surely . . . . Surely . . . . But one does n't go about saying that to a god , little honeycomb . Nor to his priestess . ' And catching his small , brown , twinkling eye , she thought of Kossil , High Priestess of the Godking , whom she had feared ever since she first came to the Place ; and she took his meaning . “
9955	9956	9959	9959	he	174	” “
9982	10093	9966	9966	He	174	“ Gifts ! His temple is painted fresh every year , there 's a hundredweight of gold on the altar , the lamps burn attar of roses ! And look at the Hall of the Throne - holes in the roof , and the dome cracking , and the walls full of mice , and owls , and bats . . . . But all the same it will outlast the Godking and all his temples , and all the kings that come after him . It was there before them , and when they 're all gone it will still be there . It is the center of things . ”
10094	10102	9959	9959	he	174	“ It is the center of things . ”
10103	10248	10249	10249	She	601	“ There are riches there ; Thar tells me about them sometimes . Enough to fill the Godking 's temple ten times over Gold and trophies given ages ago , a hundred generations , who knows how long . They 're all locked away in the pits and vaults , underground . They wo n't take me there yet , they keep me waiting and waiting . But I know what it 's like . There are rooms underneath the Hall , underneath the whole Place , under where we stand now . There 's a great maze of tunnels , a Labyrinth . It 's like a great dark city , under the hill . Full of er . 31 The Prisoners gold , and the swords of old heroes , and old crowns , and bones , and years , and silence . ”
10282	10293	10294	10294	he	165	“ Well , and you 're mistress of all that , ”
10297	10305	10294	10294	he	165	“ The silence , and the dark . ”
10306	10366	10379	10379	his	165	“ I am . But they wo n't show me anything , only the rooms above ground , behind the Throne . They have n't even shown me the entrances to the places underground ; they just mumble about them sometimes . They 're keeping my own domain from me ! Why do they make me wait and wait ? ”
10367	10375	10376	10376	Manan	165	“ You are young . And perhaps , "
10383	10426	10379	10379	his	165	“ perhaps they 're afraid , little one . It 's not their domain , after all . It 's yours . They are in danger when they enter there . There 's no mortal that does n't fear the Nameless Ones . ”
10586	10622	10583	10583	Kossil	172	“ One of my mistress ' duties , as she knows , is the sacrifice of certain prisoners , criminals.of noble birth , who by sacrilege or treason have sinned against our lord the Godking . ”
10628	10635	10637	10637	Arha	166	“ Or against the Nameless Ones , ”
10639	10695	10637	10637	Arha	166	" Truly . Now it is not fitting that the Eaten One while yet a child should undertake this duty . But my mistress is no longer a child . There are prisoners in the Room of Chains , sent a month ago by the grace of our lord the Godking from his city Awabath . ”
10696	10711	10583	10583	Kossil	172	“ I did not know prisoners had come . Why did I not know ? ”
10712	10756	10757	10757	Arha	166	“ Prisoners are brought at night , and secretly , in the way prescribed of old in the rituals of the Tombs . It is the secret way my mistress will follow , if she takes the path that leads along the wall . "
10863	10874	10875	10875	Arha	166	“ It is very easy to climb the Tomb Wall , ”
10884	10894	10895	10895	Kossil	172	“ We have not men enough to rebuild it , ”
10898	10907	10895	10895	Kossil	172	“ We have men enough to guard it . ”
10908	10918	10971	10971	She	172	“ Only slaves . They can not be trusted . ”
10919	10954	10895	10895	Kossil	172	“ They can be trusted if they 're frightened . Let the penalty be the same for them as for the stranger they allow to set foot on the holy ground within the wall . ”
10955	10961	10895	10895	Kossil	172	" What is that penalty ? ”
10982	10990	10971	10971	She	172	“ To be decapitated before the Throne . ”
10994	11011	10992	10993	The Prisoners	618	" Is it my mistress ' will that a guard be set upon the Tomb Wall ? ”
11012	11016	11017	11018	the girl	551	“ It is , "
11123	11126	11128	11128	her	166	“ Here , ”
11222	11230	11204	11204	She	166	“ Under the red rocks , mistress . ”
11284	11290	11292	11292	She	166	" What must be done ? ”
11320	11332	11292	11292	She	166	“ My mistress has all the keys to the dark places . ”
11385	11389	11376	11376	She	166	“ That one , ”
11453	11456	11430	11430	Arha	166	" Now ? "
11457	11459	11430	11430	Arha	166	“ Together "
11607	11614	11615	11615	She	166	“ Did you bring a light ? ”
11625	11631	11632	11632	Kossil	172	“ I brought no light , ”
11873	11882	11883	11884	the girl	551	“ Here we must be beneath the Stones , ”
11918	11946	11947	11947	Kossil	172	“ Yes . This is the Undertomb . Go on . I can not stay here . Follow the wall to the left . Pass three openings . ”
12006	12015	12016	12016	Arha	166	“ I shall come here with a torch , ”
12082	12088	12089	12089	Kossil	172	“ Light is forbidden here . ”
12280	12286	12314	12314	Arha	166	“ Is this the Labyrinth ? ”
12288	12303	12314	12314	Arha	166	“ No . This is the lesser maze , which is beneath the Throne . ”
12304	12313	12314	12314	Arha	166	“ Where is the entrance to the Labyrinth ? ”
12332	12465	12322	12322	she	166	“ The second opening we passed in the Undertomb . Feel for a door to the right now , a wooden door , perhaps we 've passed it already — Arha heard Kossil 's hands fumbling uneasily along the wall , scraping on the rough rock . She kept her fingertips light against the rock , and in a moment felt the smooth grain of wood beneath them . She pushed on it , and the door creaked open easily . She stood for a moment blind with light . They entered a large low room , walled with hewn stone and lighted by one fuming torch hung from a chain . The place was foul with the torch - smoke that had no outlet . Arha 's eyes stung and watered . "
12471	12472	12322	12322	she	166	” “
12475	12499	12322	12322	she	166	” At last she realized that the three heaps of something on 37 The Prisoners the far side of the room were men . “
12511	12512	12508	12509	no guard	664	” “
12517	12664	12508	12509	no guard	664	” She went a little farther into the room , hesitant , peering through the smoky haze . The prisoners were manacled by both ankles and one wrist to great rings driven into the rock of the wall . If one of them wanted to lie down , his chained arm must remain raised , hanging from the manacle . Their hair and beards had made a matted tangle which , together with the shadows , hid their faces . One of them half lay , the other two sat or squatted . They were naked . The smell from them was stronger even than the reek of smoke . One of them seemed to be watching Arha ; she thought she saw the glitter of eyes , then was not sure . The others had not moved or lifted their heads . She turned away . “
12672	12676	12677	12677	They	665	” she said . “
12700	12721	12697	12698	the Godking	1699	” Kossil 's eyes shone with the reddish torchlight . Arha looked again at the prisoners , awed and curious . “
12745	12764	12734	12734	You	671	” The one man stared at her through the black brush of his hair , but said nothing . “
12777	12781	12771	12771	they	665	” Kossil said . “
12824	12825	12816	12816	yours	671	” "
12833	12898	12899	12903	The Priestess of the Tombs	1656	” Arha no longer looked at the prisoners . She faced Kossil instead , drawing strength from the massive body , the cold THE TOMBS OF ATUAN 38 voice . She felt dizzy , and the reek of smoke and filth made her sick , yet she seemed to think and speak with perfect calm . Had she not done this many times before ? “

12952	12953	12931	12935	the captain of the guards	676	” “
12963	12983	12931	12935	the captain of the guards	676	” Kossil seemed to be sneering at her lack of imagination . She stood dumb . Kossil went on , “

13029	13030	13012	13012	he	178	” “
13118	13181	13183	13183	them	665	” Arha looked up and saw , beside the chain from which the torch hung , a wooden square set into the stone ceiling . It was far too small for a man to crawl through , but a rope lowered from it would come down just within reach of the middle prisoner of the three . She looked away again quickly . “
13200	13204	13254	13255	My 39	698	" Kossil bowed . “
13213	13214	13216	13216	Duby	179	” “

13294	13484	13485	13485	Mistress	1766	” Arha said , very shrill . She turned and hurried back to the wooden door , and out of the Room of Chains into the blackness of the tunnel . It seemed sweet and peaceful as a starless night , silent , without sight , or light , or life . She plunged into the clean darkness , hurried forward through it like a swimmer through water . Kossil hastened along , behind her and getting farther behind , panting , lumbering . Without hesitation Arha repeated the missed and taken turnings as they had come , skirted the vast echoing Undertomb , and crept , bent over , up the last long tunnel to the shut door of rock . There she crouched down and felt for the long key on the ring at her waist . She found it , but could not find the keyhole . There was no pinprick of light in the invisible wall before her . Her fingers groped over it seeking lock or bolt or handle and finding nothing . Where must the key go ? How could she get out ? "
13487	13503	13504	13504	Mistress	1766	" Kossil 's voice , magnified by echoes , hissed and boomed far behind her . “
13525	13536	13537	13537	Arha	166	” Arha crouched against the rock . She said nothing . "
13539	13540	13537	13537	Arha	166	" "
13545	13546	13537	13537	Arha	166	” “
13549	13571	13537	13537	Arha	166	" She came , crawling on hands and knees along the passage , like a dog , to Kossil 's skirts . "
13599	13794	13798	13799	the Prisoner	691	” Arha got to her feet , and held onto Kossil 's robes . They went forward , following the strangely carven wall of the cavern to the right for a long way , then entering a black gap in the blackness . They went upward now , in tunnels , by stairs . The girl still clung to the woman 's robe . Her eyes were shut . There was light , red through her eyelids . She thought it was the torchlit room full of smoke again , and did not open her eyes . But the air smelt sweetish , dry and moldy , a familiar smell ; and her feet were on a staircase steep almost as a ladder . She let go Kossil 's robe , and looked . A trapdoor was open over her head . She scrambled through it after Kossil . It let her into a room she knew , a little stone cell containing a couple of chests and iron boxes , in the warren of rooms behind the Throne Room of the Hall . Daylight glimmered gray and faint in the hallway outside its door "
13859	13889	13852	13852	I	0	” Kossil still spoke in an undertone , and with a kind of spitefulness . Her heavy face within the black cowl was pale , and damp with sweat . “
13901	13902	13903	13903	I	0	” “
13937	13982	13932	13932	You	708	" The girl nodded . She looked up into the older woman 's face , and thought how strange it looked , pale with scarcely mastered fear and yet triumphant , as if Kossil gloated over her weakness . ret dan 41 . The Prisoners “
13990	14029	13983	13983	I	0	” Arha said , and then trying to turn away from Kossil she felt her legs give way , and saw the room turn over . She fainted in a little black heap at the priestess ' feet . “
14034	14045	14046	14046	You	0	” Kossil said , still breathing heavily , standing motionless . “
14050	14240	14046	14046	You	0	” O CON Dreams and Tales Arha was not well for several days . They treated her for fever . She kept to her bed , or sat in the mild autumn sunlight on the porch of the Small House , and looked up at the western hills . She felt weak and stupid . The same ideas occurred to her again and again . She was ashamed of having fainted . No guard had been set upon the Tomb Wall , but now she would never dare ask Kossil about that . She did not want to see Kossil at all : never . It was because she was 43 Dreams and Tales ashamed of having fainted . Often , in the sunlight , she would plan how she was going to behave next time she went into the dark places under the hill . She thought many times about what kind of death she should command for the next set of prisoners , more elaborate , better suited to the rituals of the Empty Throne . Each night , in the dark , she woke up screaming , “
14252	14443	14247	14247	They	710	” She dreamed a great deal . She dreamed that she had to cook food , great cauldrons full of savory porridge , and pour it all out into a hole in the ground . She dreamed that she had to carry a full bowl of water , a deep brass bowl , through the dark , to someone who was thirsty . She could never get to this person . She woke , and she herself was thirsty , but she did not go and get a drink . She lay awake , eyes open , in the room without windows . One morning Penthe came to see her . From the porch Arha saw her approach the Small House with a careless , purposeless air , as if she just happened to be wandering that way . If Arha had not spoken she would not have come up the steps . But Arha was lonely , and spoke . Penthe made the deep bow required of all who approached the Priestess of the Tombs , and then plopped down on the steps below Arha and made a noise like “
14446	14471	14247	14247	They	710	” She had gotten quite tall and plump ; anything she did turned her cherry pink , and she was pink now from walking . “
14485	14555	14478	14478	I	0	” She suddenly produced a rush net containing six or eight perfect yellow apples , from somewhere under her voluminous black robe . She was now consecrated to the service of the Godking , and served in his temple under Kossil ; but she was n't yet a priestess , and still did lessons and chores with the novices . THE TOMBS TU AN HBS 0 44 OF ATUAN UM “
14601	14625	14643	14643	You	711	" Arha felt the pale gold satin skins of the apples , looked at the twigs to which brown leaves still delicately clung . “
14630	14631	14643	14643	You	711	” "
14635	14639	14643	14643	You	711	” said Penthe . “
14646	14669	14643	14643	You	711	" Penthe selected the smallest , out of politeness , and ate it in about ten juicy , skillful , interested bites . "
14676	14680	14670	14670	I	0	” she said . “
14974	15012	14961	14961	she	716	” Penthe 's fair , round face took on a repulsive sneer , not at all like Kossil 's cold expression , and yet somehow so like Kossil that Arha gave a snort of almost terrified laughter . “
15035	15047	15029	15031	the brown goat	727	" Penthe dissolved in laughter , tears welled in her eyes . “
15065	15084	15086	15086	Kossil	172	” . Both girls rocked back and forth in spasms of giggling , holding their knees , choking . “
15113	15161	15086	15086	Kossil	172	" The end of the tale was lost in laughter . Penthe finally wiped her eyes and nose , and absentmindedly started on another apple . To laugh so hard made Arha feel a little shaky . She calmed herself down , and after a while asked , “
15170	15171	15164	15164	you	716	" “
15262	15274	15256	15256	they	731	" Penthe bit her apple with a cheerful , rueful face . “
15284	15285	15256	15256	they	731	” “
15387	15440	15381	15381	I	0	” Arha looked down at her with a dark steady gaze . She did not understand . She felt that she had never seen Penthe before , never looked at her and seen her , round and full of life and juice as one of her golden apples , beautiful to see . “
15450	15472	15381	15381	I	0	" she asked , rather harshly . Penthe , always submissive and easily bullied , did not take alarm this time . “
15485	15495	15475	15475	I	0	” she said with an indifference that shocked Arha . “
15633	15775	15623	15623	he	1699	" Arha agreed with Penthe , for secretly she had come to consider the self - styled Divine Emperors of Kargad as upstarts , false gods trying to filch the worship due to the true and everlasting Powers . But there was something underneath Penthe 's words with which she did n't agree , something wholly new to her , frightening to her . She had not realized how very different people were , how differently they saw life . She felt as if she had looked up and suddenly seen a whole new planet hanging huge and populous right outside the window , an entirely strange world , one in which the gods did not matter . She was scared by the solidity of Penthe 's unfaith . Scared , she struck out . 47 Dreams and Tales ever men . “
15817	15841	15806	15806	I	0	” She spoke pleasantly , as if offering her friend a better choice . The pink went right out of Penthe 's cheeks . “
15844	15848	15849	15849	you	753	” she said , “
15869	15870	15857	15857	I	0	" “
15873	15874	15857	15857	I	0	" “
15882	15932	15875	15875	I	0	” Penthe said in a low voice . Arha made a little sound of scorn , but she was pleased . She had made her point . Penthe might disbelieve in the gods , but she feared the unnameable powers of the dark — as did every mortal soul . "
15946	15957	15939	15939	you	753	" Arha said . A long silence fell between them . "
15969	15978	15958	15958	You	753	" Penthe said in her soft dreamy way . “
16006	16007	16000	16000	I	0	" “
16011	16789	16000	16000	I	0	” Arha said , superior and amused , and Penthe slowly consumed a third apple down to the seeds . The demands of the endless ritual of the Place brought Arha out of her privacy a couple of days later . Twin kids had been born out of season to a she - goat , and were to be sacrificed to the Twin God - Brothers as the custom was : an important rite , at which the First Priestess must be present . Then it was dark of the moon , and the ceremonies of the darkness must be performed before the Empty Throne . Arha breathed in the drugging fumes of herbs burning in broad trays of bronze before the Throne , and danced , solitary in black . She danced for the unseen spirits of the dead and the unborn and as she THE TOMBS OF ATUAN 48 danced the spirits crowded the air around her , following the turn and spin of her feet and the slow , sure gestures of her arms . She sang the songs whose words no man understood , which she had learned syllable by syllable , long ago , from Thar . A choir of priestesses hidden in the dusk behind the great double row of columns echoed the strange words after her , and the air in the vast ruinous room hummed with voices , as if the crowding spirits repeated the chants again and again . The Godking in Awabath sent no more prisoners to the Place , and gradually Arha ceased to dream of the three now long since dead and buried in shallow graves in the great cavern under the Tombstones . She summoned up her courage to return to that cavern . She must go back there : the Priestess of the Tombs must be able to enter her own domain without terror , to know its ways . The first time she entered the trapdoor was hard ; yet not so hard as she had feared . She had schooled herself up to it so well , had so determined that she would go alone and keep her nerve , that when she came there she was almost dismayed to find that there was nothing to be afraid of . Graves might be there , but she could not see them ; she could not see anything . It was black ; it was silent . And that was all . Day after day she went there , always entering by the trapdoor in the room behind the Throne , until she knew well the whole circuit of the cavern , with its strange sculptured walls -as well as one can know what one can not see . She never left the walls , for in striking out across the great hollow she might soon lose the sense of direction in the darkness , and so , blundering back at last to the wall , not know where she was . For as she had learned the first time , the important thing 49 Dreams and Tales down in the dark places was to know which turnings and openings one had passed , and which were to come . It must be done by counting , for they were all alike to the groping hands . Arha 's memory had been well trained , and she found no difficulty to this odd trick of finding one 's way by touch and number , instead of by sight and common sense . She soon knew by heart all the corridors that opened off the Undertomb , the lesser maze that lay under the Hall of the Throne and the hilltop . But there was one corridor she never entered : the second left of the red rock entrance , that one which , if she entered mistaking it for one she knew , she might never find her way out of again . Her longing to enter it , to learn the Labyrinth , grew steadily , but she restrained it until she had learned all she could about it , aboveground . Thar knew little about it but the names of certain of its rooms , and the list of directions , of turns made and missed , for getting to these rooms . She would tell these to Arha , but she would never draw them in the dust or even with the gesture of a hand in the air ; and she herself had never followed them , had never entered the Labyrinth . But when Arha asked her , “
16806	16809	15958	15958	You	753	" or , “
16827	17664	15958	15958	You	753	” – then Thar would be silent a little , and then recite the strange directions she had learned long before from Arha - that - was : so many crossings passed , so many left - hand turns taken , and so on , and so on . And all these Arha got by heart , as Thar had , often on the first listening . When she lay in bed nights she would repeat them to herself , trying to imagine the places , the rooms , the turnings . Thar showed Arha the many spy holes that opened into the maze , in every building and temple of the Place , and even under rocks out of doors . The spiderweb of stone - walled tunTHE TOMBS OF ATUAN 50 Sei ere ca Ves OI TOOI CW nels underlay all the Place and even beyond its walls ; there were miles of tunnels , down there in the dark . No person there but she , the two High Priestesses , and their special servants , the eunuchs Manan , Uahto , and Duby , knew of the existence of this maze that lay beneath every step they took . There were vague rumors of it among the others ; they all knew that there were caves or rooms of some sort under the Tombstones . But none of them was very curious about anything to do with the Nameless Ones and the places sacred to them . Perhaps they felt that the less they knew , the better . Arha of course had been intensely curious , and knowing that there were spy holes into the Labyrinth , had sought for them ; yet they were so well concealed , in the pavements of the floors or in the desert ground , that she had never found one , not even the one in her own Small House , until Thar showed it to her . One night in early spring she took a candle lantern and went down with it , unlit , through the Undertomb to the second passage to the left of the passage from the red rock door . In the dark , she went some thirty paces down the passage , and then passed through a doorway , feeling the iron frame set in the rock : the limit , until now , of her explorations . Past the Iron Door she went a long way along the tunnel , and when at last it began to curve to the right , she lit her candle and looked about her . For light was permitted , here . She was no longer in the Undertomb . She was in a place less sacred , though perhaps more dreadful . She was in the Labyrinth . The raw , blank walls and vault and floor of rock surrounded her in the small sphere of candlelight . The air was dead . Before her and behind her the tunnel stretched off into darkness . All the tunnels were the same , crossing and recrossing . She kept careful count of her turnings and passings , and recited 51 . Dreams and Tales Thar 's directions to herself , though she knew them perfectly . For it would not do to get lost in the Labyrinth . In the Undertomb and the short passages around it , Kossil or Thar might find her , or Manan come seeking for her , for she had taken him there several times . Here , none of them had ever been : only she herself . Little good it would do her if they came to the Undertomb and called aloud , and she was lost in some spiraling tangle of tunnels half a mile away . She imagined how she might hear the echo of voices calling her , echoing down every corridor , and she would try to come to them , but , lost , would only become farther lost . So vividly did she imagine this that she stopped , thinking she heard a distant voice calling . But there was nothing . And she would not get lost . She was very careful ; and this was her place , her own domain . The powers of the dark , the Nameless Ones , would guide her steps here , just as they would lead astray any other mortal who dared enter the Labyrinth of the Tombs . She did not go far into it that first time , but far enough that the strange , bitter , yet pleasurable certainty of her utter solitude and independence there grew strong in her , and led her back , and back again , and each time farther . She came to the Painted Room , and the Six Ways , and followed the long Outmost Tunnel , and penetrated the strange tangle that led to the Room of Bones . “
17671	17684	17685	17685	Mistress	1766	" she asked Thar , and the stern , thin priestess answered , “
17696	17697	17692	17693	No one	385	" “
17703	17704	17692	17693	No one	385	" "

17762	17763	17721	17727	those who tried to steal those treasures	762	” “
17778	17779	17773	17773	you	0	" “
17782	17783	17773	17773	you	0	" “
17921	17922	18309	18309	You	777	” “
17928	18308	18309	18309	You	777	” Thar told her , and she remembered , as she remembered all that was told her . But she did not go to see the Great Treasure of the Tombs . Some feeling that her will or her knowledge was not yet complete held her back . Or perhaps she wanted to keep something in reserve , something to look forward to , that cast a glamor over those endless tunnels through the dark that ended always in blank walls or bare dusty cells . She would wait awhile before she saw her treasures . After all , had she not seen them before ? It still made her feel strange when Thar and Kossil spoke to her of things she had seen or said before she died . She knew that indeed she had died , and had been reborn in a new body at the hour of her old body 's death : not only once , fifteen years ago , but fifty years ago , and before that , and before that , back down the years and hundreds of years , genera- 53 Dreams and Tales tion before generation , to the very beginning of years when the Labyrinth was dug , and the Stones were raised , and the First Priestess of the Nameless Ones lived in this place and danced before the Empty Throne . They were all one , all those lives and hers . She was the First Priestess . All human beings were forever reborn , but only she , Arha , was reborn forever as herself . A hundred times she had learned the ways and turnings of the Labyrinth and had come to the hidden room at last . Sometimes she thought she remembered . The dark places under the hill were so familiar to her , as if they were not only her domain , but her home . When she breathed in the drug - fumes to dance at dark of the moon , her head grew light and her body was no longer hers ; then she danced across the centuries , barefoot in black robes , and knew that the dance had never ceased . Yet it was always strange when Thar said , “
18316	18322	18309	18309	You	777	" . Once she asked , “
18340	18696	18697	18697	Many	779	” The idea of robbers had struck her as exciting , but improbable . How would they come secretly to the Place ? Pilgrims were very few , fewer even than prisoners . Now and then new novices or slaves were sent from lesser temples of the Four Lands , or a small group came to bring some offering of gold or rare incense to one of the temples . And that was all . Nobody came by chance , or to buy and sell , or to sightsee , or to steal ; nobody came but under orders . Arha did not even know how far it was to the nearest town , twenty miles or more ; and the nearest town was a small one . The Place was guarded and defended by emptiness , by solitude . Anybody crossing the desert that surTHE TOMBS OF ATUAN 54 rounded it , she thought , would have as much chance of going unseen as a black sheep in a snowfield . She was with Thar and Kossil , with whom much of her time was spent now when she was not in the Small House or alone under the hill . It was a stormy , cold night in April . They sat by a tiny fire of sage on the hearth in the room behind the Godking 's temple , Kossil 's room . Outside the doorway , in the hall , Manan and Duby played a game with sticks and counters , tossing a bundle of sticks and catching as many as possible on the back of the hand . Manan and Arha still sometimes played that game , in secret , in the inner courtyard of the Small House . The rattle of dropped sticks , the husky mumbles of triumph and defeat , the small crackle of the fire , were the only sounds when the three priestesses fell silent . All around beyond the walls reached the profound silence of the desert night . From time to time came the patter of a sparse , hard shower of rain . “
18713	18757	18708	18708	none	781	" said Thar . Taciturn as she was , she liked now and then to tell a story , and often did so as part of Arha 's instruction . She looked tonight as if a story might be gotten out of her . "
18764	18765	18766	18766	They	623	” “
18770	18774	18766	18766	They	623	” Kossil said . “

20371	20397	20352	20354	the Twin Gods	464	” said Kossil . And the fire sputtered , and the rain spattered on the roof , and outside the gloomy doorway Manan cried shrilly , “
20408	20568	20569	20569	mistress	1766	" Light Under the Hill As the year was rounding again towards winter , Thar died . In the summer a wasting disease had come upon her ; she who had been thin grew skeletal , she who had been grim now did not speak at all . Only to Arha would she talk , sometimes , when they were alone together ; then even that ceased , and she went silently into the dark . When she was gone , Arha missed her sorely . If Thar had been stern , she had never been cruel . It was pride she had taught to Arha , not fear . THE TOMBS OF ATUAN 60 OW Now there was only Kossil . A new High Priestess for the Temple of the Twin Gods would come in spring from Awabath ; until then , Arha and Kossil between them were the rulers of the Place . The woman called the girl “
20571	23102	20569	20569	mistress	1766	" and should obey her if commanded . But Arha had learned not to command Kossil . She had the right to do so , but not the strength ; it would take very great strength to stand up against Kossil 's jealousy of a higher status than her own , her hatred of anything she herself did not control . Since Arha had learned ( from gentle Penthe ) of the existence of unfaith , and had accepted it as a reality even though it frightened her , she had been able to look at Kossil much more steadily , and to understand her . Kossil had no true worship in her heart of the Nameless Ones or of the gods . She held nothing sacred but power . The Emperor of the Kargad Lands now held the power , and therefore he was indeed a godking in her eyes , and she would serve him well . But to her the temples were mere show , the Tombstones were rocks , the Tombs of Atuan were dark holes in the ground , terrible but empty . She would do away with the worship of the Empty Throne , if she could . She would do away with the First Priestess , if she dared . Arha had come to face even this last fact quite steadily . Perhaps Thar had helped her to see it , though she had never said anything directly . In the first stages of her illness , before the silence came upon her , she had asked Arha to come to her every few days , and had talked to her , telling her much about the doings of the Godking and his predecessor , and the ways of Awabath - matters which she should as an important priestess know , but which were not often flattering to the Godking and his court . And she had spoken of her own life , vas CIC were 61 . Light Under the Hill and described what the Arha of the previous life had looked like and done ; and sometimes , not often , she had mentioned what might be the difficulties and dangers of Arha 's present life . Not once did she mention Kossil by name . But Arha had been Thar 's pupil for eleven years , and needed no more than a hint or a tone to understand , and to remember . After the gloomy commotion of the Rites of Mourning was over , Arha took to avoiding Kossil . When the long works and rituals of the day were done , she went to her solitary dwelling ; and whenever there was time , she went to the room behind the Throne , and opened the trapdoor , and went down into the dark . In daytime and nighttime , for it made no difference there , she pursued a systematic exploration of her domain . The Undertomb , with its great weight of sacredness , was utterly forbidden to any but priestesses and their most trusted eunuchs . Any other , man or woman , who ventured there would certainly be struck dead by the wrath of the Nameless Ones . But among all the rules she had learned , there was no rule forbidding entry to the Labyrinth . There was no need . It could be entered only from the Undertomb ; and anyway , do flies need rules to tell them not to enter in a spider 's web ? So she took Manan often into the nearer regions of the Labyrinth , that he might learn the ways . He was not at all eager to go there , but as always he obeyed her . She made sure that Duby and Uahto , Kossil 's eunuchs , knew the way to the Room of Chains and the way out of the Undertomb , but no more ; she never took them into the Labyrinth . She wanted no one but Manan , utterly faithful to her , to know those secret ways . For they were hers , hers alone , forever . She had begun her full exploration with the Labyrinth . All the autumn she spent many days walking those endless corridors , THE TOMBS OF ATUAN 62 and still there were regions of them she had never come to . There was a weariness in that tracing of the vast , meaningless web of ways ; the legs got tired and the mind got bored , forever reckoning up the turnings and the passages behind and to come . It was wonderful , laid out in the solid rock underground like the streets of a great city ; but it had been made to weary and confuse the mortal walking in it , and even its priestess must feel it to be nothing , in the end , but a great trap . So , more and more as winter deepened , she turned her thorough exploration to the Hall itself , the altars , the alcoves behind and beneath the altars , the rooms of chests and boxes , the contents of the chests and boxes , the passages and attics , the dusty hollow under the dome where hundreds of bats nested , the basements and underbasements that were the anterooms of the corridors of darkness . Her hands and sleeves perfumed with the dry sweetness of a musk that had fallen to powder lying for eight centuries in an iron chest , her brow smeared with the clinging black of cobweb , she would kneel for an hour to study the carvings on a beautiful , time - ruined coffer of cedar wood , the gift of some king ages since to the Nameless Powers of the Tombs . There was the king , a tiny stiff figure with a big nose , and there was the Hall of the Throne with its flat dome and porch columns , carved in delicate relief on the wood by some artist who had been dust for how many hundred years . There was the One Priestess , breathing in the drug - fumes from the trays of bronze and prophesying or advising the king , whose nose was broken off in this frame ; the face of the Priestess was too small to have clear features , yet Arha would imagine that the face was her own face . She wondered what she had told the king with the big nose , and whether he had been grateful . Ize W 63 Light Under the Hill She had favorite places in the Hall of the Throne , as one might have favorite spots to sit in a sunny house . She often went to a little half - loft over one of the robing rooms in the hinder part of the Hall . There ancient gowns and costumes were kept , left from the days when great kings and lords came to worship at the Place of the Tombs of Atuan , acknowledging a domain greater than their own or any man 's . Sometimes their daughters , the princesses , had put on these soft white silks , embroidered with topaz and dark amethyst , and had danced with the Priestess of the Tombs . There were little painted ivory tables in one of the treasuries , showing such a dance , and the lords and kings waiting outside the Hall , for then as now no man ever set foot on the ground of the Tombs . But the maidens might come in , and dance with the Priestess , in white silk . The Priestess herself wore rough cloth , homespun black , always , then and now ; but she liked to come and finger the sweet , soft stuff , rotten with age , the unperishing jewels tearing from the cloth by their own slight weight . There was a scent in these chests different from all the musks and incenses of the temples of the Place : a fresher scent , fainter , younger . In the treasure rooms she would spend a night learning the contents of a single chest , jewel by jewel , the rusted armor , the broken plumes of helms , the buckles and pins and brooches , bronze , silver - gilt , and solid gold . Owls , undisturbed by her presence , sat on the rafters and opened and shut their yellow eyes . A bit of starlight shone in between tiles of the roof ; or the snow came sifting down , fine and cold as those ancient silks that fell to nothing at hand 's touch . One night late in the winter , it was too cold in the Hall . She went to the trapdoor , raised it , swung down onto the steps , and closed it above her . She set off silently on the way THE TOMBS OF ATUAN 64 IW she now knew so well , the passage to the Undertomb . There , of course , she never bore a light ; if she carried a lantern , from going in the Labyrinth or in the dark of night above ground , she extinguished it before she came near the Undertomb . She had never seen that place , never in all the generations of her priestesshood . In the passage now , she blew out the candle in the lamp she carried , and without slowing her pace at all went forward in the pitch dark , easy as a little fish in dark water . Here , winter or summer , there was no cold , no heat : always the same even chill , a little damp , changeless . Up above , the great frozen winds of winter whipped thin snow over the desert . Here there was no wind , no season ; it was close , it was still , it was safe . She was going to the Painted Room . She liked sometimes to go there and study the strange wall drawings that leapt out of the dark at the gleam of her candle : men with long wings and great eyes , serene and morose . No one could tell her what they were , there were no such paintings elsewhere in the Place , but she thought she knew ; they were the spirits of the damned , who are not reborn . The Painted Room was in the Labyrinth , so she must pass through the cavern beneath the Tombstones first . As she approached it down the slanting passage , a faint gray bloomed , a bare hint and glimmer , the echo of an echo of a distant light . She thought her eyes were tricking her , as they often did in that utter blackness . She closed them , and the glimmering vanished . She opened them , and it reappeared . She had stopped and was standing still . Gray , not black . A dull edge of pallor , just visible , where nothing could be visible , where all must be black . She took a few steps forward and put out her hand to that angle of the tunnel wall ; and , infinitely faint , saw the move- 65 Light Under the Hill ment of her hand . She went on . This was strange beyond thought , beyond fear , this faint blooming of light where no light had ever been , in the inmost grave of darkness . She went noiseless on bare feet , black - clothed . At the last turn of the corridor she halted ; then very slowly took the last step , and looked , and saw . -Saw what she had never seen , not though she had lived a hundred lives : the great vaulted cavern beneath the Tombstones , not hollowed by man 's hand but by the powers of the Earth . It was jeweled with crystals and ornamented with pinnacles and filigrees of white limestone where the waters under earth had worked , eons since : immense , with glittering roof and walls , sparkling , delicate , intricate , a palace of diamonds , a house of amethyst and crystal , from which the ancient darkness had been driven out by glory . Not bright , but dazzling to the dark - accustomed eye , was the light that worked this wonder . It was a soft gleam , like marshlight , that moved slowly across the cavern , striking a thousand scintillations from the jeweled roof and shifting a thousand fantastic shadows along the carven walls . The light burned at the end of a staff of wood , smokeless , unconsuming . The staff was held by a human hand . Arha saw the face beside the light ; the dark face : the face of a man . She did not move . For a long time he crossed and recrossed the vast cave . He moved as if he sought something , looking behind the lacy cataracts of stone , studying the several corridors that led out of the Undertomb , yet not entering them . And still the Priestess of the Tombs stood motionless , in the black angle of the passage , waiting . What was hardest for her to think , perhaps , was that she THE TOMBS OF ATUAN 66 was looking at a stranger . She had very seldom seen a stranger . It seemed to her that this must be one of the wardens - no , one of the men from over the wall , a goatherd or guard , a slave of the Place ; and he had come to see the secrets of the Nameless Ones , maybe to steal something from the Tombs . ... To steal something . To rob the Dark Powers . Sacrilege : the word came slowly into Arha 's mind . This was a man , and no man 's foot must ever touch the soil of the Tombs , the Holy Place . Yet he had come here into the hollow place that was the heart of the Tombs . He had entered in . He had made light where light was forbidden , where it had never been since world 's beginning . Why did the Nameless Ones not strike him down ? He was standing now looking down at the rocky floor , which was cut and troubled . One could see that it had been opened and reclosed . The sour sterile clods dug up for the graves had not all been stamped down again . Her Masters had eaten those three . Why did they not eat this one ? What were they waiting for ? For their hands to act , for their tongue to speak . ... “
23109	23941	23964	23964	me	0	” she screamed all at once at the top of her voice . Great echoes shrilled and boomed across the cavern , seeming to blur the dark , startled face that turned towards her , and , for one moment , across the shaken splendor of the cavern , saw her . Then the light was gone . All splendor gone . Blind dark , and silence . Now she could think again . She was released from the spell of light . He must have come in by the red rock door , the Prisoners ' Door , so he would try to escape by it . Light and silent as the soft - winged owls she ran the half - circuit of the cavern to the 67 Light Under the Hill low tunnel that led to the door which opened only inwards . She stooped there at the entrance of the tunnel . There was no draft of wind from outside ; he had not left the door fixed open behind him . It was shut , and if he was in the tunnel , he was trapped there . But he was not in the tunnel . She was sure of it . So close , in that cramped place , she would have heard his breath , felt the warmth and pulse of his life itself . There was no one in the tunnel . She stood erect , and listened . Where had he gone ? The darkness pressed like a bandage on her eyes . To have seen the Undertomb confused her ; she was bewildered . She had known it only as a region defined by hearing , by hand 's touch , by drifts of cool air in the dark ; a vastness ; a mystery , never to be seen . She had seen it , and the mystery had given place , not to horror , but to beauty , a mystery deeper even than that of the dark . She went slowly forward now , unsure . She felt her way to the left , to the second passageway , the one that led into the Labyrinth . There she paused and listened . Her ears told her no more than her eyes . But , as she stood with one hand on either side of the rock archway , she felt a faint , obscure vibration in the rock , and on the chill , stale air was the trace of a scent that did not belong there : the smell of the wild sage that grew on the desert hills , overhead , under the open sky . Slow and quiet she moved down the corridor , following her nose . After perhaps a hundred paces she heard him . He was almost as silent as she , but he was not so surefooted in the dark . She heard a slight scuffle , as if he had stumbled on the uneven floor and recovered himself at once . Nothing else . She waited awhile and then went slowly on , touching her rightTHE TOMBS OF ATUAN 68 OW hand fingertips very lightly to the wall . At last a rounded bar of metal came under them . There she stopped , and felt up the strip of iron until , almost as high as she could reach , she touched a projecting handle of rough iron . This , suddenly , with all her strength , she dragged downward . There was a fearful grinding and a clash . Blue sparks leapt out in a falling shower . Echoes died away , quarreling , down the corridor behind her . She put out her hands and felt , only a few inches before her face , the pocked surface of an iron door . She drew a long breath . Returning slowly up the tunnel to the Undertomb , and keeping its wall to her right , she went on to the trapdoor in the Hall of the Throne . She did not hasten , and went silently , was no need for silence any more . She had caught her thief . The door that he had gone through was the only way into or out of the Labyrinth ; and it could be opened only from the outer side . He was down there now , in the darkness underground , and he would never come out again . Walking slowly and erect , she went past the Throne into the long columned hall . There , where one bronze bowl on the high tripod brimmed with the red glow of charcoal , she turned and approached the seven steps that led up to the Throne . On the lowest step she knelt , and bowed her forehead down to the cold , dusty stone , littered with mouse bones dropped by the hunting owls . “
23952	23962	23945	23945	I	0	” she said , not speaking the words aloud . “
23996	24070	24073	24073	I	0	” CSS 1 69 Light Under the Hill led bar up the n , she Henly , leapt down only iron Yet even as she prayed , in her mind 's eye she saw the quivering radiance of the lighted cavern , life in the place of death ; and instead of terror at the sacrilege and rage against the thief , she thought only how strange it was , how strange . ... "
24077	24099	24073	24073	I	0	” she asked herself as she came out into the blast of the winter wind and drew her cloak about her . “
24209	24223	24206	24207	A sorcerer	865	" She halted , though the wind almost buffeted her off her feet . "
24244	24314	24240	24242	Erreth - Akbe	188	” And there was such an outrageous glamor in this , that she grew warm all over , even in that icy wind , and laughed out loud . All around her the Place , and the desert around it , was black and silent ; the wind keened ; there were no lights down in the Big House . Thin , invisible snow Alicked past on the wind . "
24334	25116	25117	25117	Emenn	195	” This thought chilled her for a moment , but it did not convince her . The Nameless Ones had let him enter . Why not ? He could not do any harm . What harm is a thief who ca n't leave the scene of his theft ? Spells and black powers he must have , and strong ones no doubt , since he had got that far ; but he would not get farther . No spell cast by mortal THE TOMBS OF ATUAN 70 man could be stronger than the will of the Nameless Ones , the presences in the Tombs , the Kings whose Throne was empty . To reassure herself of this , she hastened on down to the Small House . Manan was asleep on the porch , rolled up in his cloak and the ratty fur blanket that was his winter bed . She entered quietly , so as not to awaken him , and without lighting any lamp . She opened a little locked room , a mere closet at the end of the hall . She struck a flint spark long enough to find a certain place on the floor , and kneeling , pried up one tile . A bit of heavy , dirty cloth , only a few inches square , was revealed to her touch . This she slipped aside noiselessly . She started back , for a ray of light shot upward , straight into her face . After a moment , very cautiously , she looked into the opening . She had forgotten that he carried that queer light on his staff . She had been expecting at most to hear him , down there in the dark . She had forgotten the light , but he was where she had expected him to be : right beneath the spy hole , at the iron door that blocked his escape from the Labyrinth . He was standing there , one hand on his hip , the other holding out at an angle the wooden staff , as tall as he was , to the tip of which clung the soft will - o'-the - wisp . His head , which she looked down upon from some six feet above , was cocked a bit to the side . His clothes were those of any winter traveler or pilgrim , a short heavy cloak , a leather tunic , leggings of wool , laced sandals ; there was a light pack on his back , a water bottle slung from it , a knife sheathed at his hip . He stood there still as a statue , easy and thoughtful . Slowly he raised his staff from the ground , and held the bright tip of it out towards the door , which Arha could not see from her spy hole . The light changed , growing smaller 71 . Light Under the Hill and brighter , an intense brilliance . He spoke aloud . The language he spoke was strange to Arha , but stranger to her than the words was the voice , deep and resonant . The light on the staff brightened , flickered , dimmed . For a moment it died quite away , and she could not see him . The pale violet marshlight reappeared , steady , and she saw him turn away from the door . His spell of opening had failed . The powers that held the lock fast on that door were stronger than any magic he possessed . He looked about him , as if thinking , now what ? The tunnel or corridor in which he stood was about five feet wide . Its roof was from twelve to fifteen feet above the rough rock floor . The walls here were of dressed stone , laid without mortar but very carefully and closely , so that one could scarcely slip a knife - tip into the joints . They leaned inward increasingly as they rose , forming a vault . There was nothing else . He started forward . One stride took him out of Arha 's range of vision . The light died away . She was about to replace the cloth and the tile , when again the soft shaft of light rose up out of the floor before her . He had come back to the door . Perhaps he had realized that if he once left it and entered the maze , he was not very likely to find it again . He spoke , one word only , in a low voice . “
25119	25129	25117	25117	Emenn	195	" he said , and then again , louder , “
25132	25186	25130	25130	Emenn	195	” And the iron door rattled in its jambs , and low echoes rolled down the vaulted tunnel like thunder , and it seemed to Arha that the floor beneath her shook . But the door stayed fast . He laughed then , a short laugh , that of a man who thinks , “
25196	26127	25188	25189	a fool	887	” He looked around the walls once more , and as he glanced upward Arha saw the THE TOMBS OF ATUAN 72 smile lingering on his dark face . Then he sat down , unslung his pack , got out a piece of dry bread , and munched on it . He unstopped his leather bottle of water and shook it ; it looked light in his hand , as if nearly empty . He replaced the stopper without drinking . He put the pack behind him for a pillow , pulled his cloak around him , and lay down . His staff was in his right hand . As he lay back , the little wisp or ball of light floated upward from the staff and hung dimly behind his head , a few feet off the ground . His left hand was on his breast , holding something that hung from a heavy chain around his neck . He lay there quite comfortable , legs crossed at the ankle ; his gaze wandered across the spy hole and away ; he sighed and closed his eyes . The light grew slowly dimmer . He slept . The clenched hand on his breast relaxed and slipped aside , and the watcher above saw then what talisman he wore on the chain : a bit of rough metal , crescent - shaped , it seemed . The faint glimmer of his sorcery died away . He lay in silence and the dark . Arha replaced the cloth and reset the tile in its place , rose cautiously and slipped away to her room . There she lay long awake in the wind - loud darkness , seeing always before her the crystal radiance that had shimmered in the house of death , the soft unburning fire , the stones of the tunnel wall , the quiet face of the man asleep . nes ma on it it ; i In for The Man Trap Next day , when she had finished with her duties at the various temples , and with her teaching of the sacred dances to the novices , she slipped away to the Small House and , darkening the room , opened the spy hole and peered down it . There was no light . He was gone . She had not thought he would stay so long at the unavailing door , but it was the only place she knew to look . How was she to find him now that he had lost himself ? THE TOMBS OF ATUAN 74 The tunnels of the Labyrinth , by Thar 's account and her own experience , extended in all their windings , branchings , spirals , and dead ends , for more than twenty miles . The blind alley that lay farthest from the Tombs was not much more than a mile away in a straight line , probably . But down underground , nothing ran straight . All the tunnels curved , split , rejoined , branched , interlaced , looped , traced elaborate routes that ended where they began , for there was no beginning , and no end . One could go , and go , and go , and still get nowhere , for there was nowhere to get to . There was no center , no heart of the maze . And once the door was locked , there was no end to it . No direction was right . Though the ways and turnings to the various rooms and regions were firm in Arha 's memory , even she had taken with her on her longer explorations a ball of fine yarn , and let it unravel behind her , and rewound it as she followed it returning . For if one of the turns and passages that must be counted were missed , even she might be lost . A light was no help , for there were no landmarks . All the corridors , all the doorways and openings , were alike . He might have gone miles by now , and yet not be forty feet from the door where he had entered . She went to the Hall of the Throne , and to the Twin Gods ' temple , and to the cellar under the kitchens , and , choosing a moment when she was alone , looked through each of those spy holes down into the cold , thick dark . When night came , freezing and blazing with stars , she went to certain places on the Hill and raised up certain stones , cleared away the earth , peered down again , and saw the starless darkness underground . He was there . He must be there . Yet he had escaped her . He would die of thirst before she found him . She would have 75 The Man Trap blind more down Irved orate to send Manan into the maze to find him , once she was sure he was dead . That was unbearable to think of . As she knelt in the starlight on the bitter ground of the Hill , tears of rage rose in her eyes . She went to the path that led back down the slope to the temple of the Godking . The columns with their carved capitals shone white with hoarfrost in the starlight , like pillars of bone . She knocked at the rear door , and Kossil let her in . “
26133	26143	26144	26144	Priestess	197	” said the stout woman , cold and watchful . "
26154	26216	26217	26218	A man	614	” Kossil was taken off guard ; for once something had occurred that she did not expect . She stood and stared . Her eyes seemed to swell a little . It flitted across Arha 's mind that Kossil looked very like Penthe imitating Kossil , and a wild laugh rose up in her , was repressed , and died away . “
26224	26225	26226	26227	A man	614	” “
26232	26247	26229	26230	a stranger	2190	” Then as Kossil continued to look at her with disbelief , she added , “
26261	26267	26256	26256	I	0	" Kossil disdained her irony . “
26274	26275	26270	26271	a man	614	" "

26546	26554	26526	26526	He	614	” Kossil said , as if deliberating . “

26639	27406	27407	27407	Wizard	198	" the girl said . She turned and went out into the night , pulling her hood up over her head against the hissing , icy wind . Did she not know ? It had been childish of her , and stupid , to come to Kossil . She would get no help there . Kossil herself knew nothing , all she knew was cold waiting and death at the end of it . She did not understand . She did not see that the man must be found . It must not be the same as with those others . She could not bear that again . Since there must be death let it be swift , in daylight . Surely it would be more fitting that this thief , the first man in centuries brave enough to try to rob the 00 77 The Man Trap Tombs , should die by sword 's edge . He did not even have an immortal soul to be reborn . His ghost would go whining through the corridors . He could not be let die of thirst there alone in the dark . Arha slept very little that night . The next day was filled with rites and duties . She spent the night going , silent and without lantern , from one spy hole to another in all the dark buildings of the Place , and on the windswept hill . She went to the Small House to bed at last , two or three hours before dawn , but still she could not rest . On the third day , late in the afternoon , she walked out alone onto the desert , towards the river that now lay low in the winter drought , with ice among the reeds . A memory had come to her that once , in the autumn , she had gone very far in the Labyrinth , past the Six - Cross , and all along one long curving corridor she had heard behind the stones the sound of running water . Might not a man athirst , if he came that way , stay there ? There were spy holes even out here ; she had to search for them , but Thar had shown her each one , last year , and she refound them without much trouble . Her recall of place and shape was like that of a blind person : she seemed to feel her way to each hidden spot , rather than to look for it . At the second , the farthest of all from the Tombs , when she pulled up her hood to cut out light , and put her eye to the hole cut in a flat pan of rock , she saw below her the dim glimmer of the wizardly light . He was there , half out of sight . The spy hole looked down at the very end of the blind alley . She could see only his back , and bent neck , and right arm . He sat near the corner of the walls , and was picking at the stones with his knife , a short dagger of steel with a jeweled grip . The blade of it was broken short . The broken point lay directly under the spy THE TOMBS OF ATUAN 78 hole . He had snapped it trying to pry apart the stones , to get at the water he could hear running , clear and murmurous in that dead stillness under earth , on the other side of the impenetrable wall . His movements were listless . He was very different , after these three nights and days , from the figure that had stood lithe and calm before the iron door and laughed at his own defeat . He was still obstinate , but the power was gone out of him . He had no spell to stir those stones aside , but must use his useless knife . Even his sorcerer 's light was wan and dim . As Arha watched , the light flickered ; the man 's head jerked and he dropped the dagger . Then doggedly he picked it up and tried to force the broken blade between the stones . Lying among ice - bound reeds on the riverbank , unconscious of where she was or what she was doing , Arha put her mouth to the cold mouth of rock , and cupped her hands around to hold the sound in . “
27409	27464	27407	27407	Wizard	198	” she said , and her voice slipping down the stone throat whispered coldly in the tunnel underground . The man started and scrambled to his feet , so going out of the circle of her vision when she looked for him . She put her mouth to the spy hole again and said , “
27515	28446	28460	28460	She	913	” As she moved to look again , she must have let a shaft of daylight shoot through the spy hole into the tunnel for a moment , for when she looked he was back in the circle of her vision and staring upwards at the opening . His face , which she now saw to be scarred in some way , was strained and eager . The lips were parched and black , the eyes bright . He raised his staff , bringing the light closer and closer to her 79 The Man Trap to get = QuS in ne imstood OWN ut of I use coneyes . Frightened , she drew back , stopped the spy hole with its rock lid and litter of covering stones , rose , and went back swiftly to the Place . She found her hands were shaky , and sometimes a giddiness swept over her as she walked . She did not know what to do . If he followed the directions she had given him , he would come back in the direction of the iron door , to the room of pictures . There was nothing there , no reason for him to go there . There was a spy hole in the ceiling of the Painted Room , a good one , in the treasury of the Twin Gods ' temple ; perhaps that was why she had thought of it . She did not know . Why had she spoken to him ? She could let a little water for him down one of the spy holes , and then call him to that place . That would keep him alive longer . As long as she pleased , indeed . If she put down water and a little food now and then , he would go on and on , days , months , wandering in the Labyrinth ; and she could watch him through the spy holes , and tell him where water was to be found , and sometimes tell him falsely so he would go in vain , but he would always have to go . That would teach him to mock the Nameless Ones , to swagger his foolish manhood in the burial places of the Immortal Dead ! But so long as he was there , she would never be able to enter the Labyrinth herself . Why not ? she asked herself , and replied - Because he might escape by the iron door , which I must leave open behind me . . . . But he could escape no farther than the Undertomb . The truth was that she was afraid to face him . She was afraid of his power , the arts he had used to enter the Undertomb , the sorcery that kept that light burning . And yet , was that so much to be feared ? The powers that ruled in the dark places were on her side , not his . Plainly he could not do much , there in the realm of the THE TOMBS OF ATUAN 80 Nameless Ones . He had not opened the iron door ; he had not summoned magic food , nor brought water through the wall , nor conjured up some demon monster to break down the walls , all of which she had feared he might be able to do . He had not even found his way in three days ' wandering to the door of the Great Treasury , which surely he had sought . Arha herself had never yet pursued Thar 's directions to that room , putting off and putting off the journey out of a certain awe , a reluctance , a sense that the time had not yet come . Now she thought , why should he not go that journey for her ? He could look all he liked at the treasures of the Tombs . Much good they would do him ! She could jeer at him , and tell him to eat the gold , and drink the diamonds . With the nervous , feverish hastiness that had possessed her all these three days , she ran to the Twin Gods ' temple , unlocked its little vaulted treasury , and uncovered the well - hidden spy hole in the floor . The Painted Room was below , but pitch dark . The way the man must follow in the maze was much more roundabout , miles longer perhaps ; she had forgotten that . And no doubt he was weakened and not going fast . Perhaps he would forget her directions and take the wrong turning . Few people could remember directions from one hearing of them , as she could . Perhaps he did not even understand the tongue she spoke . If so , let him wander till he fell down and died in the dark , the fool , the foreigner , the unbeliever . Let his ghost whine down the stone roads of the Tombs of Atuan until the darkness ate even it . ... Next morning very early , after a night of little sleep and evil dreams , she returned to the spy hole in the little temple . She looked down and saw nothing : blackness . She lowered a candle burning in a little tin lantern on a chain . He was there , ess 81 . The Man Trap had not le wall vn the to do "

29223	29402	29221	29221	mistress	1766	” 83 The Man Trap They parted before the altar of the God - Brothers . Arha went , without haste now , to the Small House , and called Manan to accompany her . Since she had spoken to Kossil she knew what must be done . She and Manan went together up the hill , into the Hall , down into the Undertomb . Straining together at the long handle , they opened the iron door of the Labyrinth . They lit their lanterns there , and entered . Arha led the way to the Painted Room , and from it started on the way to the Great Treasury . The thief had not got very far . She and Manan had not walked five hundred paces on their tortuous course when they came upon him , crumpled up in the narrow corridor like a heap of rags thrown down . He had dropped his staff before he fell ; it lay some distance from him . His mouth was bloody , his eyes half shut . “
29407	29426	29403	29403	He	931	” said Manan , kneeling , his great yellow hand on the dark throat , feeling the pulse . “

29494	29666	29491	29491	I	0	" His face more melancholy than ever , Manan obeyed , hoisting the young man effortfully up onto his shoulders like a long sack . He staggered along after Arha thus laden . He could not go far at a time under that load . They stopped a dozen times on the return journey for Manan to catch his breath . At each halt the corridor was the same : the grayishyellow , close - set stones rising to a vault , the uneven rocky THE TOMBS OF ATUAN 84 - - - - - - - oner . floor , the dead air ; Manan groaning and panting , the stranger lying still , the two lanterns burning dull in a dome of light that narrowed away into darkness down the corridor in both directions . At each halt Arha dripped some of the water she had brought in a flask into the dry mouth of the man , a little at a time , lest life returning kill him . "

This on my face is the mark of one of the kinship of the Nameless Ones . But no longer nameless , for I learned his name , in the end . "
31775	31784	31660	31660	she	971	" What do you mean ? What name ? ”

31920	32061	31889	31889	her	977	“ But I have . Very long ! I am the First Priestess , the Reborn . I have served my masters for a thousand years and a thousand years before that . I am their servant and their voice and their hands . And I am their vengeance on those who defile the Tombs and look upon what is not to be seen ! Stop your lying and your boasting , ca n't you see that if I say one word my guard will come and cut your head off your shoulders ? Or if I go away and lock this door , then nobody will come , ever , and you 'll die here in the dark , and those I serve will eat your flesh and eat your soul and leave your bones here in the dust ? ”
32837	32847	32848	32848	She	166	“ What is it like in the Inner Lands ? ”
32890	33110	32871	32871	she	166	" Well , there are many islands . Four times forty , they say , in the Archipelago alone , and then there are the Reaches ; no man has ever sailed all the Reaches , nor counted all the lands . And each is different from the others . But the fairest of them all , maybe , is Havnor , the great land at the center of the world . In the heart of Havnor on a broad bay full of ships is the City Havnor . The towers of the city are built of white marble . The house of every prince and merchant has a tower , so they rise up one above the other . The roofs of the houses are red tile , and all the bridges over the canals are covered in mosaic work , red and blue and green . And the flags of the princes are all colors , flying from the white towers . On the highest of all the towers the Sword of Erreth - Akbe is set , like a pinnacle , skyward . When the sun rises on Havnor it flashes first on that blade and makes it bright , and when it sets the Sword is golden still above the evening , for a while . ”
33111	33118	33119	33119	she	1017	" Who was Erreth - Akbe ? ”
33149	33182	33146	33146	he	1018	“ It 's true you would know little of him here . Nothing beyond his coming to the Kargish lands , perhaps . And how much of that tale do you know ? ”
33195	33213	33214	33214	she	1017	“ That he lost his sorcerer 's staff and his amulet and his power — like you , "
33217	33253	33214	33214	she	1017	“ He escaped from the High Priest and fled into the west , and dragons killed him . But if he 'd come here to the Tombs , there had been no need of dragons . "

33280	33304	33305	33305	Her	1017	“ He was a dragonlord , they say . And you say you 're one . Tell me , what is a dragonlord ? ”
33327	33336	33337	33337	he	188	" One whom the dragons will speak with , ”
33340	33422	33337	33337	he	188	“ that is a dragonlord , or at least that is the center of the matter . It 's not a trick of mastering the dragons , as most people think . Dragons have no masters . The question is always the same , with a dragon : will he talk with you or will he eat you ? If you can count upon his doing the former , and not doing the latter , why then you 're a dragonlord . ”
33423	33428	33319	33319	he	188	“ Dragons can speak ? ”
33429	33501	33337	33337	he	188	“ Surely ! In the Eldest Tongue , the language we men learn so hard and use so brokenly , to make our spells of magic and of patterning . No man knows all that language , or a tenth of it . He has not time to learn it . But dragons live a thousand years . . . . They are worth talking to , as you might guess . ”
33502	33510	33337	33337	he	188	“ Are there dragons here in Atuan ? ”
33511	33642	33337	33337	he	188	" Not for many centuries , I think , nor in Karego - At . But in your northernmost island , Hur - at - Hur , they say there are still large dragons in the mountains . In the Inner Lands they all keep now to the farthest west , the remote West Reach , islands where no men live and few men come . If they grow hungry , they raid the lands to their east ; but that is seldom . I have seen the island where they come to dance together . THE TOMBS OF ATUAN 96 They fly on their great wings in spirals , in and out , higher and higher over the western sea , like a storming of yellow leaves in autumn . ”

33713	33721	33706	33706	He	1020	“ Why should I lie , Arha ? ”
33722	33913	33914	33914	He	1023	“ To make me feel like a fool , and stupid , and afraid . To make yourself seem wise , and brave , and powerful , and a dragonlord and all this and all that . You 've seen dragons dancing , and the towers in Havnor , and you know all about everything . And I know nothing at all and have n't been anywhere . But all you know is lies ! You are nothing but a thief and a prisoner , and you have no soul , and you 'll never leave this place again . It does n't matter if there 's oceans and dragons and white towers and all that , because you 'll never see them again , you 'll never even see the light of the sun . All I know is the dark , the night underground . And that 's all there really is . That 's all there is to know , in the end . The silence , and the dark . You know everything , wizard . But I know one thing — the one true thing ! ”
34002	34012	34013	34013	she	1024	“ This is why I have let you live , ”

If you have none , if it 's all foolery and lies , why then I 'll have done with you . Do you understand ? "

It 's also true that here in the Place of the Old Powers , my strength is very little and my crafts do n't avail me . Now I could work illusion for you , and show you all kinds of wonders . That 's the least part of wizardry . I could work illusions when I was a child ; I can do them even here . But if you believe them , they 'll frighten you , and you may wish to kill me if fear makes you angry . And if you disbelieve them , you 'll see them as only lies and foolery , as you say ; and so I forfeit my life again . And my purpose and desire , at the moment , is to stay alive . ”
34313	34385	34310	34310	she	1025	“ Oh , you 'll stay alive awhile , ca n't you see that ? You are stupid ! All right , show me these illusions . I know them to be false and wo n't be afraid of them . I would n't be afraid if they were real , as a matter of fact . But go ahead . Your precious skin is safe , for tonight , anyhow . ”

34843	34849	34850	34850	she	1032	“ How do I know , ”
34855	34865	34850	34850	she	1032	“ that you are what you seem to be ? ”

35030	35057	35026	35026	she	1032	“ It is trickery and lies . I have seen enough . You will be fed to the Nameless Ones . I shall not come again . "

35692	35774	35882	35882	Manan	165	" You must bring the man where I lead you , and you must do it in the dark . Then when I bring you back here , you will dig a grave in the Undertomb , and make a coffin for it , and put it in the grave empty , and fill in the earth again , yet so that it can be felt and found if someone sought for it . A deep grave . Do you understand ? ”
35775	35778	35780	35780	Manan	165	" No , "

But in the dark they must go ; for she did not want either of them to learn this way . A left turn from the Painted Room , and pass two openings ; go right at the Four Ways , and pass the opening to the right ; then a long curving way , and a flight of steps down , long , slippery , and much too narrow for normal human feet . Farther than these steps she had never gone . The air was fouler here , very still , with a sharp odor to it . The directions were clear in her mind , even the tones of Thar 's voice speaking them . Down the steps ( behind her , the prisoner stumbled in the pitch blackness , and she heard him gasp as Manan kept him afoot with a mighty jerk on the chain ) , and at the foot of the steps turn at once to the left . Hold the left then for three openings , then the first right , then hold to the right . The tunnels curved and angled , none ran straight . “
36281	36291	36056	36056	Manan	165	” said Thar 's voice in the darkness of her mind,"and
36298	36409	36056	36056	Manan	165	” She slowed her step , stooped over , and felt before her with one hand along the floor . The corridor now ran straight for a long way , giving false reassurance to the wanderer . All at once her groping hand , which never ceased to touch and sweep the rock before her , felt nothing . There was a stone lip , an edge : beyond the edge , void . To the right the wall of the corridor plunged down sheer into the pit . To the left there was a ledge or curb , not much more than a hand'sbreadth wide . 103 The Great Treasure “
36480	36713	36714	36714	Manan	165	" The tunnel ran in short zigzags with many side openings . From some of these as they passed the sound of their footsteps echoed in a strange way , hollowly ; and stranger than that , a very faint draft could be felt , sucking inward . Those corridors must end in pits like the one they had passed . Perhaps there lay , under this low part of the Labyrinth , a hollow place , a cavern so deep and so vast that the cavern of the Undertomb would be little in comparison , a huge black inward emptiness . But above that chasm , where they went in the dark tunnels , the corridors grew slowly narrower and lower , until even Arha must stoop . Was there no end to this way ? The end came suddenly : a shut door . Going bent over , and a little faster than usual , Arha ran up against it , jarring her head and hands . She felt for the keyhole , then for the small key on her belt - ring , never used , the silver key with the haft shaped like a dragon . It fit , it turned . She opened the door of the Great Treasure of the Tombs of Atuan . A dry , sour , stale air sighed outward through the dark . "

InTHE TOMBS OF ATUAN 104 - - deed the place filled her with a dull dread , and she felt some mistrust of the prisoner , pinioned though he was . Once inside , she struck her light . Her hands trembled . The lantern candle caught reluctantly ; the air was close and dead . In the yellowish flicker that seemed bright after the long passages of night , the treasure room loomed about them , full of moving shadows . There were six great chests , all of stone , all thick with a fine gray dust like the mold on bread ; nothing else . The walls were rough , the roof low . The place was cold , with a deep and airless cold that seemed to stop the blood in the heart . There were no cobwebs , only the dust . Nothing lived here , nothing at all , not even the rare , small , white spiders of the Labyrinth . The dust was thick , thick , and every grain of it might be a day that had passed here where there was no time or light : days , months , years , ages all gone to dust . "
37032	37042	37029	37029	you	1082	” Arha said , and her voice was steady . “
37065	37096	37097	37097	You	1082	” He said nothing , and his face was quiet , but there was in his eyes something that moved her : a desolation , the look of one betrayed . "
37137	37143	37132	37132	she	172	” Still he said nothing . “
37186	37259	37260	37260	You	1082	" He sat down on one of the great chests , looking spent . The trailing chain clanked harshly on the stone . He looked around at the gray walls and the shadows , then at her . 105 The Great Treasure She looked away from him , at the stone chests . She had no wish at all to open them . She did not care what marvels rotted in them . “
37272	37293	37260	37260	You	1082	” She came to him and unlocked the iron belt , and unbuckled Manan 's leather belt from his arms . “
37373	37374	37368	37368	You	1082	” “
37382	37387	37379	37379	you	1082	” he said gently . “
37487	37500	37482	37482	I	0	” He raised his face to her . His expression was strange . “
37506	37802	37504	37504	Tenar	164	” he said . Names She brought Manan back through the winding ways in the dark , and left him in the dark of the Undertomb , to dig the grave that must be there as proof to Kossil that the thief had indeed been punished . It was late , and she went straight to the Small House to bed . In the night she woke suddenly ; she remembered that she had left her cloak in the Painted Room . He would have nothing for warmth in that dank vault but his own short cloak , no bed but the dusty stone . A cold 107 Names WO grave , a cold grave , she thought miserably , but she was too weary to wake up fully , and soon slipped back into sleep . She began to dream . She dreamt of the souls of the dead on the walls of the Painted Room , the figures like great bedraggled birds with human hands and feet and faces , squatting in the dust of the dark places . They could not fly . Clay was their food and dust their drink . They were the souls of those not reborn , the ancient peoples and the unbelievers , those whom the Nameless Ones devoured . They squatted all around her in the shadows , and a faint creaking or cheeping sound came from them now and then . One of them came up quite close to her . She was afraid at first and tried to draw away , but could not move . This one had the face of a bird , not a human face ; but its hair was golden , and it said in a woman 's voice , “
37805	37810	37504	37504	Tenar	164	” tenderly , softly , “
37813	38028	37504	37504	Tenar	164	” She woke . Her mouth was stopped with clay . She lay in a stone tomb , underground . Her arms and legs were bound with graveclothes and she could not move or speak . Her despair grew so great that it burst her breast open and like a bird of fire shattered the stone and broke out into the light of day —— the light of day , faint in her windowless room . Really awake this time , she sat up , worn out by that night 's dreaming , her mind befogged . She got into her clothes , and went out to the cistern in the walled courtyard of the Small House . She plunged her arms and face , her whole head , into the icy water until her body jumped with cold and her blood raced . Then flinging back her dripping hair she stood erect and looked up into the morning sky . It was not long past sunrise , a fair winter 's day . The sky was yellowish , very clear . High up , so high he caught the sunlight and burned like a fleck of gold , a bird was circling , a hawk or desert eagle . THE TOMBS OF ATUAN 108 “
38033	38060	38031	38031	Tenar	164	” she said , not aloud , and she shook with cold , and terror , and exultation , there under the open , sunwashed sky . “
38071	38122	38069	38069	Tenar	164	” The golden fleck veered westward towards the mountains , out of sight . Sunrise gilded the eaves of the Small House . Sheep bells clanked , down in the folds . The smells of woodsmoke and buckwheat porridge from the kitchen chimneys drifted on the fine , fresh wind . "
38157	38239	38240	38240	I	0	" She pulled up her hood and ran off to breakfast . Food , after three days of semi - fasting , made her feel solid , gave her ballast ; she did n't feel so wild and lighthearted and frightened . She felt quite capable of handling Kossil , after breakfast . She came up beside the tall , stout figure on the way out of the dining hall of the Big House , and said in a low voice , “
38256	38270	38271	38271	I	0	" The cold gray eyes looked sidelong at her from the black hood . "

38541	38550	38551	38551	He	1090	” the girl said , raising her voice . “

38746	38782	38783	38783	They	1107	" The girl 's eyes were blazing . Kossil 's face was hidden , THE TOMBS OF ATUAN 110 drawn back into the black cowl . Penthe and the others watched , terrified and enthralled . “
38787	38809	38783	38783	They	1107	” Kossil 's voice said , not loud , a whistling thread of sound out of the depths of the cowl . “
38896	38983	38894	38894	Arha	166	" She turned and went on , with her massive , deliberate steps , crushing the frost - starred weeds under her heavy , sandaled feet , going to the white - pillared house of the Godking . The girl stood , slight and dark , as if frozen to earth , in the front courtyard of the Big House . Nobody moved , nothing moved , only Kossil , in all the vast landscape of court and temple , hill and desert plain and mountain . "
38994	39277	39278	39279	Little mistress	933	” she shouted in a voice like a hawk 's scream , and lifting her arm with the hand stretched out stiff , she brought the curse down on the priestess ' heavy back , even as she set foot on the steps of her temple . Kossil staggered , but did not stop or turn . She went on , and entered the Godking 's door . Arha spent that day sitting on the lowest step of the Empty Throne . She dared not go into the Labyrinth ; she would not go among the other priestesses . A heaviness filled her , and held her there hour after hour in the cold dusk of the great hall . She stared at the pairs of thick pale columns going off into the gloom at the distant end of the hall , and at the shafts of daylight that slanted in from holes in the roof , and at the thick - curling smoke from the bronze tripod In Names of charcoal near the Throne . She made patterns with the little bones of mice on the marble stair , her head bowed , her mind active and yet as if stupefied . Who am I ? she asked herself , and got no answer . Manan came shuffling down the hall between the double rows of columns , when the light had long since ceased to shaft the hall 's darkness , and the cold had grown intense . Manan 's doughy face was very sad . He stood at a distance from her , his big hands hanging ; a torn hem of his rusty cloak dangled by his heel . "

When he had been gone some while she turned and went around the dais of the Throne , and vanished into the dark behind it . Poltrowe Tore The Ring of Erreth - Akbe In the Great Treasury of the Tombs of Atuan , time did not pass . No light ; no life ; no least stir of spider in the dust or worm in the cold earth . Rock , and dark , and time not passing . On the stone lid of a great chest the thief from the Inner Lands lay stretched on his back like the carven figure on a tomb . The dust disturbed by his movements had settled on his clothes . He did not move . 115 The Ring of Erreth - Akbe The lock of the door rattled . The door opened . Light broke the dead black and a fresher draft stirred the dead air . The man lay inert . Arha closed the door and locked it from within , set her lantern on a chest , and slowly approached the motionless figure . She moved timorously , and her eyes were wide , the pupils still fully dilated from her long journey through the dark . "
40262	40303	40260	40260	Sparrowhawk	202	" She touched his shoulder , and spoke his name again , and yet again . He stirred then , and moaned . At last he sat up , face drawn and eyes blank . He looked at her unrecognizing . “
40321	40341	40312	40312	I	0	” He fumbled for the flask as if his hands were numb , and drank , but not deeply . “
40348	40356	40312	40312	I	0	” he asked , speaking with difficulty . “
40392	40415	40416	40416	I	0	” She got out one of the flat gray loaves from the bag she had brought , but he shook his head . "
40429	40441	40416	40416	I	0	” He put his head in his hands and sat unmoving . “
40455	40531	40446	40446	I	0	” He did not answer . She put the cloak down and stood gazing at him . She was trembling a little , and her eyes were still black and wide . All at once she sank down on her knees , bowed over , and began to cry , with deep sobs that wrenched her body , but brought no tears . He got down stiffly from the chest , and bent over her . "
40534	40540	40446	40446	I	0	" THE TOMBS OF ATUAN 116 "
40561	40645	40551	40552	The gods	1932	” He laid his hands on her head , pushing back the hood . He began to speak . His voice was soft , and the words were in no tongue she had ever heard . The sound of them came into her heart like rain falling . She grew still to listen . When she was quiet he lifted her , and set her like a child on the great chest where he had lain . He put his hand on hers . "
40653	40654	40648	40648	you	1139	” “
41068	41118	41119	41119	I	0	” The man stood listening , his hand still on hers , his head a little bent . Some vigor had come back into his face and stance , though the scars on his cheek showed livid gray , and there was dust yet on his clothes and hair . "
41225	41226	41212	41212	they	751	" "
41247	41248	41239	41239	they	751	" “
41254	41259	41251	41251	you	164	" she said listlessly . "
41406	41458	41460	41460	you	1173	” As he said that , he turned her hand palm upward in his own for a moment , gazing at THE TOMBS OF ATUAN 118 dr it ; then he turned away , walked a few steps about the room , and stopped again before her . She said nothing . "
41524	41540	41543	41543	they	751	” She listened , her eyes heavy , her gaze fixed on the flickering lantern . “
41550	41551	41543	41543	they	751	" “
41554	41558	41559	41559	They	751	” she whispered . "
41852	41925	41847	41847	you	1187	” She listened , though her expression did not change . He said no more . They were silent ; but it was not the silence that had been in that room before she entered . There was the breathing of two of them now , and the movement of life in their veins , and the burning of the candle in its lantern of tin , a tiny , lively sound . “
41935	41965	41930	41930	you	1187	” He walked up and down the room , stirring up the fine dust , stretching his arms and shoulders in an effort to shake off the numbing chill . “
42142	42143	42146	42146	you	0	” “
42151	42174	42146	42146	you	0	” He looked at her a moment , a deep clear glance across the shadows between them ; he hesitated a moment . “
42267	42269	42263	42263	you	0	” . “
42275	42276	42270	42270	I	0	” “

42383	42394	42358	42360	the Dark Figure	1206	” Her voice was dull and slow . He frowned . “
42401	42405	42358	42360	the Dark Figure	1206	” he said , “
42478	42632	42473	42473	They	208	” He stopped ; his voice had sunk low , and he seemed to have lost the thread of his speech . He rubbed his hands over his forehead , and presently went to drink again from the flask . He broke off a hunch of bread and sat down on the chest opposite to eat it . What he said was true ; she felt a weight , a pressure on her mind , that seemed to darken and confuse all thought and feeling . Yet she was not terrified , as she had been coming through the corridors alone . Only the utter silence outside the room seemed terrible . Why was that ? She had never feared the silence of the underearth before . But never before had she disobeyed the Nameless Ones , never had she set herself against them . She gave a little whimpering laugh at last . “
42651	42655	42656	42657	The Godking	174	” she said . “
42681	42682	42683	42683	I	0	” "

42875	42887	42888	42888	You	0	” He smiled at her across the shadows of the tomb . "
42907	42908	42897	42897	I	0	” “
42913	42914	42897	42897	I	0	” “

43266	43355	43251	43251	princes	1776	" So the wise lords and Mages of the Archipelago wanted the Ring of Erreth - Akbe , that they might restore the lost rune . But at last they gave up sending men out to seek it , since none could take the one half from the Tombs of Atuan , and the other half , which Erreth - Akbe gave to a Kargish king , was lost long since . They said there was no use in the search . That was many hundred years ago . "
43457	43635	43636	43636	We	1237	“ Yet two people lived there . An old man and woman ; brother and sister , I think . They were terrified of me . They had not seen any other human face for - how long ? Years , 123 The Ring of Erreth - Akbe tens of years . But I was in need , and they were kind to me . They had a hut of driftwood , and a fire . The old woman gave me food , mussels she pulled from the rocks at low tide , dried meat of seabirds they killed by throwing stones . She was afraid of me , but she gave me food . Then when I did nothing to frighten her , she came to trust me , and she showed me her treasure . She had a treasure , too . . . . It was a little dress . All of silk stuff , with pearls . A little child 's dress , a princess ' dress . She was wearing uncured sealskin . “
43731	43738	43717	43717	She	1243	” He paused for a while . “
43789	43941	43942	43942	He	1248	“ Thanks ! ' and sailed off . ... Well , so I went on , and did what I had to do . And then other things came up , and I went to the Dragons ' Run , westward , and so on . But all the time I kept the thing with me , because I felt a gratitude towards that old woman who had given me the only present she had to give . I put a chain through one of the holes pierced in it , and wore it , and never thought about it . And then one day on Selidor , the Farthest Isle , the land where Erreth - Akbe died in his battle with the dragon Orm - on Selidor I spoke with a dragon , one of that lineage of Orm . He told me what I wore upon my breast . “
43986	44151	43972	43972	they	1249	“ When I came back to the Inmost Isles , I went at last to Havnor . I was born on Gont , which lies not far west of your Kargish lands , and I had wandered a good deal since , but I had never been to Havnor . It was time to go there . I saw the white towers , and spoke with the great men , the merchants and the princes and the lords of the ancient domains . I told them what I had . I told them that if they liked , I would go seek the rest of the ring in the Tombs of Atuan , in order to find the Lost Rune , the key to peace . For we need peace sorely in the world . They were full of praise ; and one of them even gave me money to provision my boat . So I learned your tongue , and came to Atuan . ”
44163	44185	44152	44152	He	1252	" Did n't the people in our towns know you for a Westerner , by your skin , by your speech ? ”
44186	44196	44197	44197	he	1252	“ Oh , it 's easy to fool people , ”
44202	44270	44197	44197	he	1252	“ if you know the tricks . You make some illusion - changes , and nobody but another Mage will see through them . And you have no wizards or Mages here in the Kargish lands . That 's a queer thing . You banished all your wizards long ago , and forbade the practice of the Art Magic ; and now you scarcely believe in it . ”
44271	44314	44152	44152	He	1252	" I was taught to disbelieve in it . It is contrary to the teachings of the Priest Kings . But I know that only sorcery could have got you to the Tombs , and in at the door of red rock . "
44315	44342	44152	44152	He	1252	“ Not only sorcery , but good advice also . We use writing more than you , I think . Do you know how to read ? ”
44343	44354	44355	44355	He	1253	“ No . It is one of the black arts . ”
44358	44364	44365	44365	he	1253	“ But a useful one , ”
44368	44446	44365	44365	he	1253	“ An ancient unsuccessful thief left certain descriptions of the Tombs of 125 The Ring of Erreth - Akbe st to | or no Atuan , and instructions for entering , if one were able to use one of the Great Spells of Opening . All this was written down in a book in the treasury of a prince of Havnor . He let me read it . So I got as far as the great cavern — ”
44448	44452	44365	44365	he	1253	“ The Undertomb . "
44453	44615	44152	44152	He	1252	“ The thief who wrote the way to enter thought that the treasure was there , in the Undertomb . So I looked there , but I had the feeling that it must be better hidden , farther on in the maze . I knew the entrance to the Labyrinth , and when I saw you , I went to it , thinking to hide in the maze and search it . That was a mistake , of course . The Nameless Ones had hold of me already , bewildering my mind . And since then I have grown only weaker and stupider . One must not submit to them , one must resist , keep one 's spirit always strong and certain . I learned that a long time ago . But it 's hard to do , here , where they are so strong . They are not gods , Tenar . But they are stronger than any man . ”
44625	44636	44637	44637	she	1255	“ What else did you find in the treasure chests ? ”
44641	44681	44637	44637	she	1255	“ Rubbish . Gold , jewels , crowns , swords . Nothing to which any man alive has any claim . ... Tell me this , Tenar . How were you chosen to be the Priestess of the Tombs ? ”
44682	44776	44152	44152	He	1252	“ When the First Priestess dies they go looking all through Atuan for a girl - baby born on the night the Priestess died . And they always find one . Because it is the Priestess reborn . When the child is five they bring it here to the Place . And when it is six it is given to the Dark Ones and its soul is eaten by them . And so it belongs to them , and has belonged to them since the beginning days . And it has no name . ”
44777	44783	44637	44637	she	1255	“ Do you believe that ? ”
44784	44791	44637	44637	she	1255	“ I have always believed it . ”
44798	44805	44806	44806	She	1256	“ Do you believe it now ? "
44825	44838	44822	44822	she	1256	“ Tell me ... tell me about the dragons in the West . ”
44839	44868	44822	44822	she	1256	“ Tenar , what will you do ? We ca n't sit here telling each other tales until the candle burns out , and the darkness comes again . ”
44869	44882	44883	44883	She	1256	“ I do n't know what to do . I am afraid . ”
44911	44919	44908	44908	She	1256	“ I am afraid of the dark . ”
44924	45031	44908	44908	She	1256	“ You must make a choice . Either you must leave me , lock the door , go up to your altars and give me to your Masters ; then go to the Priestess Kossil and make your peace with her — and that is the end of the story - or , you must unlock the door , and go out of it , with me . Leave the Tombs , leave Atuan , and come with me oversea . And that is the beginning of the story . You must be Arha , or you must be Tenar . You can not be both . ”
45065	45090	45040	45040	She	1260	“ If I leave the service of the Dark Ones , they will kill me . If I leave this place I will die . ”
45091	45101	45040	45040	She	1260	“ You will not die . Arha will die . ”
45102	45108	45040	45040	She	1260	“ I can not . ... "
45109	45132	45040	45040	She	1260	" To be reborn one must die , Tenar . It is not so hard as it looks from the other side . "
45133	45144	45040	45040	She	1260	“ They would not let us get out . Ever . ”
45145	45171	45172	45172	He	1261	" Perhaps not . Yet it 's worth trying . You have knowledge , and I have skill , and between us we have . ... "
45175	45185	45172	45172	He	1261	“ We have the Ring of Erreth - Akbe . ”
45193	45251	45252	45252	His	1261	“ Yes , that . But I thought also of another thing between us . Call it trust . . . . That is one of its names . It is a very great thing . Though each of us alone is weak , having that we are strong , stronger than the Powers of the Dark . ”
45263	45268	45269	45269	he	1261	“ Listen , Tenar ! ”
45272	45361	45269	45269	he	1261	“ I came here a thief , an enemy , armed against you ; and you showed me mercy , and trusted me . And I have trusted you from the first time I saw your face , for one moment in the cave beneath the Tombs , beautiful in darkness . You have proved your trust in me . I have made no return . I will give you what I have to give . My true name is Ged . And this is yours to keep . ”
45380	45387	45388	45388	he	1262	“ Let the ring be rejoined , ”
45448	45455	45456	45456	she	1263	“ I will come with you , ”
45508	45516	45517	45517	he	1262	" You have set us both free , ”
45520	45550	45517	45517	he	1262	“ Alone , no one wins freedom . Come , let 's waste no time while we still have time ! Hold it out again , for a little . ”
45652	45655	45656	45656	he	215	“ There , ”
45693	45696	45698	45698	he	215	“ There ! "
45704	45723	45698	45698	he	215	“ It fits . It must be a woman 's arm - ring , or a child 's . ”
45724	45729	45730	45730	she	1263	“ Will it hold ? ”
45749	45825	45827	45827	she	1263	“ It will . I could n't put a mere mending charm on the Ring of Erreth - Akbe , like a village witch mending a kettle . I had to use a Patterning , and make it whole . It is whole now as if it had never been broken . Tenar , we must be gone . I 'll bring the bag and flask . Wear your cloak . Is there anything more ? "
45839	45847	45836	45836	he	215	“ I wish I had my staff , ”
45855	45867	45849	45849	she	1263	“ it 's just outside the door . I brought it . ”
45868	45875	45876	45876	he	215	“ Why did you bring it ? ”
45880	45895	45876	45876	he	215	“ I thought of ... taking you to the door . Letting you go . ”
45896	45941	45942	45942	She	1263	“ That was a choice you did n't have . You could keep me a slave , and be a slave ; or set me free , and come free with me , Come , little one , take courage , turn the key . "
46074	46094	46060	46060	his	261	“ Leave the lantern . I can make light if need be . What time is it , outside ? ”
46095	46104	46060	46060	his	261	“ Long past midnight when I came here . "
46105	46112	46114	46114	he	261	“ We must go forward then . ”
46242	46248	46249	46249	she	1263	“ Here 's the pit , ”
46252	46286	46299	46300	The man	261	“ I ca n't find the ledge . No , here . Be careful , I think the stones are coming loose . . . . No , no , wait - it 's loose—"She
46312	46325	46299	46300	The man	261	“ The ledge is n't safe , the stones are coming loose . ”
46326	46357	46365	46365	he	261	" I 'll make a little light , and look at them . Maybe I can mend them with the right word . It 's all right , little one . "
46613	46616	46617	46617	Ged	215	“ Come ! ”
46693	46698	46689	46689	he	215	“ What is it ? ”
46699	46708	46689	46689	he	215	“ I am lost . Make the light . ”
46709	46712	46682	46682	Halted	216	“ Lost ? ”
46713	46725	46689	46689	he	215	“ I have ... I have lost count of the turnings . ”
46726	46731	46732	46732	he	215	“ I kept count , ”
46740	46757	46732	46732	he	215	“ A left turn after the pit ; then a right , and a right again . ”
46758	46767	46768	46768	she	164	" Then the next will be right again , ”
46778	46783	46768	46768	she	164	“ Make the light . ”
46784	46796	46732	46732	he	215	“ The light wo n't show us the way , Tenar . "
46802	46814	46768	46768	she	164	" Nothing will . It is lost . We are lost . ”
46853	46866	46845	46845	He	215	“ Go on , Tenar . The next turn to the right . ”
46867	46872	46873	46873	she	164	“ Make a light , ”
46876	46882	46873	46873	she	164	“ The tunnels twist so .... "
46883	46966	46845	46845	He	215	“ I can not . I have no strength to spare . Tenar , they areThey know that we left the Treasury . They know that we 're past the pit . They are seeking us , seeking our will , our spirit . To quench it , to devour it . I must keep that alight . All my strength is going into that . I must withstand them ; with you . With your help . We must go on . "
46967	46974	46975	46975	she	1280	“ There is no way out , ”
47113	47116	47117	47117	she	1280	“ Here , ”
47137	47140	47141	47141	she	1280	" No , "
47146	47176	47141	47141	she	1280	" not this , it 's the next turn to the left . I do n't know . I ca n't do it . There 's no way out . ”
47177	47186	47121	47121	he	1282	“ We are going to the Painted Room , ”
47195	47202	47141	47141	she	1280	“ How should we go there ? ”
47204	47211	47141	47141	she	1280	“ The left turn after this . ”
47244	47248	47249	47249	she	1280	“ Straight on , ”
47423	47426	47427	47427	she	1280	“ Quick ! ”
47446	47452	47453	47453	she	1280	“ Why was it open ? ”
47456	47469	47453	47453	she	1280	“ Because your Masters need your hands to shut it for them . ”
47470	47479	47480	47480	Her	1280	“ We are coming to . . . . "
47485	47513	47480	47480	Her	1280	“ To the center of the darkness . I know . Yet we 're out of the Labyrinth . What ways out of the Undertomb are there ? ”
47514	47554	47443	47443	she	1280	" Only one . The door you entered does n't open from within . The way goes through the cavern and up passages to a trapdoor in a room behind the Throne . In the Hall of the Throne . ”
47555	47563	47443	47443	she	1280	“ Then we must go that way . ”
47564	47570	47571	47572	the girl	551	" But she is there , ”
47575	47611	47571	47572	the girl	551	“ There in the Undertomb . In the cavern . Digging in the empty grave . I can not THE TOMBS OF ATUAN 134 pass her , oh , I can not pass her again ! ”
47612	47620	47443	47443	she	1280	“ She will have gone by now . ”
47621	47628	47443	47443	she	1280	“ I can not go there . "
47629	47711	47712	47712	They	1291	“ Tenar , I hold the roof up over our heads , this moment . I keep the walls from closing in upon us . I keep the ground from opening beneath our feet . I have done this since we passed the pit where their servant waited . If I can hold off the earthquake , do you fear to meet one human soul with me ? Trust me , as I have trusted you ! Come with me now . ”
47772	47777	47778	47778	she	164	“ What is it ? "
47832	47836	47837	47838	the man	261	“ Go forward , ”
47847	47852	47837	47838	the man	261	“ Hurry , Tenar . "
47876	47898	47857	47857	she	164	“ Forgive me . O my Masters , O unnamed ones , most ancient ones , forgive me , forgive me ! "
47960	47965	47966	47966	she	164	“ It is broken , ”
47969	47974	47966	47966	she	164	“ It is locked . ”
47999	48012	47981	47981	He	261	“ It 's not locked , but held down by something heavy . "
48013	48019	47981	47981	He	261	" Can you open it ? ”
48020	48037	47981	47981	He	261	" Perhaps . I think she 'll be waiting there . Has she men with her ? ”
48038	48053	48088	48088	his	261	“ Duby and Uahto , maybe other wardens , men can not come there , ”
48054	48086	48088	48088	his	261	" I ca n't make a spell of opening , and hold off the people waiting up there , and withstand the will of the darkness , all at one time , "
48094	48126	48088	48088	his	261	“ We must try the other door then , the door in the rocks , by which I came in . She knows that it ca n't be opened from within ? "
48127	48138	48088	48088	his	261	“ She knows . She let me try it once . "
48139	48152	48153	48153	She	1298	“ Then she may discount it . Come . Come , Tenar ! "
48180	48188	48153	48153	She	1298	“ What is it - the shaking ? ”
48189	48192	48193	48193	he	261	“ Come , ”
48256	48265	48246	48246	she	1298	“ They are here ! They are here ! ”
48266	48276	48277	48278	the man	261	“ Then let them know that we are here , "
48594	48609	48569	48569	She	1298	“ No ! No ! Do n't touch me - leave me - Go ! ”
48640	48653	48633	48633	He	261	“ By the bond you wear I bid you come , Tenar . ”
48785	48787	48780	48780	he	261	“ See ”
49045	49051	49052	49052	she	1298	“ You held it back , ”
49076	49089	49052	49052	she	1298	" You held back the earthquake , the anger of the dark . "
49090	49096	49097	49097	he	1327	“ We must go on , ”
49110	49120	49121	49121	He	1327	“ I am tired , I am cold . ... "
49910	49914	49915	49915	he	261	“ I wonder , ”
49919	49940	49915	49915	he	261	" I know , but we ca n't last the night here without a fire . It gets too cold . ”
49947	49967	49944	49944	she	1298	“ Unless you have some magic that would keep us warm , or that would hide the fire . ... "
49987	49990	49991	49991	he	261	“ Brr , "
49994	50039	49991	49991	he	261	“ A fire is much better than magic . I 've put a little illusion about us here ; if someone comes by , we might look like sticks and stones to him . What do you think ? Will they be following us ? "
50040	50117	50118	50118	She	1354	“ I fear it , yet I do n't think they will . No one but Kossil knew of your being there . Kossil , and Manan . And they are dead . Surely she was in the Hall when it fell . She was waiting at the trapdoor . And the others , the rest , they must think that I was in the Hall or the Tombs , and was crushed in the earthquake . ”
50130	50174	50118	50118	She	1354	“ I hope the other buildings did n't fall . It was hard to see from the hill , there was so much dust . Surely all the temples and houses did n't fall , the Big House where all the girls sleep . ”
50175	50221	50118	50118	She	1354	“ I think not . It was the Tombs that devoured themselves . I THE TOMBS OF ATUAN 142 saw a gold roof of some temple as we turned away ; it still stood . And there were figures down the hill , people running . ”
50222	50272	50118	50118	She	1354	“ What will they say , what will they think . . . . Poor Penthe ! She might have to become the High Priestess of the Godking now . And it was always she who wanted to run away . Not I. Maybe now she 'll run away . "
50355	50364	50348	50348	They	1355	“ How far are we from the sea ? ”
50365	50383	50306	50306	She	164	“ It took me two nights and two days coming . It 'll take us longer going . ”
50384	50389	50390	50390	she	164	“ I 'm strong , ”
50393	50406	50407	50407	he	215	“ You are . And valiant . But your companion 's tired , ”
50413	50423	50407	50407	he	215	“ And we have n't any too much bread . ”
50424	50430	50306	50306	She	164	“ Will we find water ? ”
50431	50438	50306	50306	She	164	“ Tomorrow , in the mountains . ”
50439	50447	50448	50448	she	164	“ Can you find food for us ? ”
50456	50464	50448	50448	she	164	“ Hunting takes time , and weapons . ”
50465	50476	50306	50306	She	164	“ I meant , with , you know , spells . ”
50477	50484	50485	50485	he	215	“ I can call a rabbit , ”
50498	50566	50485	50485	he	215	“ The rabbits are coming out of their holes all around us , now . Evening 's their time . I could call one by name , and he 'd come . But would you catch and skin and broil a rabbit that you 'd called to you thus ? Perhaps if you were starving . But it would be a breaking of trust , I think . ”
50567	50578	50306	50306	She	164	“ Yes . I thought , perhaps you could just ... "
50599	50605	50606	50606	he	215	“ Summon up a supper , ”
50609	50651	50606	50606	he	215	“ Oh , I could . On golden plates , if you like . But that 's illusion , and when you eat illusions you end up hungrier than before . It 's about as nourishing as eating your own words . ”
50664	50670	50671	50671	she	1357	“ Your magic is peculiar , "
50685	50696	50697	50697	He	215	“ It appears to be useful only for large matters . "
50718	50726	50697	50697	He	215	" Can you really call a rabbit ? ”
50731	50738	50727	50727	Tenar	164	“ Do you want me to ? ”
50758	50764	50742	50742	He	215	“ Kebbo ... O kebbo ... "
50863	50866	50867	50867	she	1357	" Ah ! ”
50875	50880	50867	50867	she	1357	“ That 's lovely . "
50885	50891	50882	50882	she	1357	“ Could I do that ? ”
50892	50894	50981	50981	her	1357	“ Well ”
50895	50901	50902	50902	she	1357	" It is a secret , ”
50910	50959	50902	50902	she	1357	“ The rabbit 's name is a secret . At least , one should not use it lightly , for no reason . But what is not a secret , but rather a gift , or a mystery , do you see , is the power of calling . "
50960	50963	50964	50964	she	1357	“ Oh , ”
50967	50975	50964	50964	she	1357	" that you have . I know ! ”
51163	51168	51169	51169	Ged	215	“ Let 's walk , ”
51172	51180	51169	51169	Ged	215	“ it 's not long till dawn . "
51332	51337	51325	51330	A small bird among the aspens	1368	“ dee , dee , ”
51548	51556	51557	51557	she	164	“ I wish we could stay here , ”
51572	51578	51557	51557	she	164	“ I like this place . ”
51579	51586	51587	51587	he	261	“ This is a good place , ”
51590	51597	51557	51557	she	164	“ People would never come here . "
51598	51612	51613	51613	he	261	“ Not often . . . . I was born in the mountains , ”
51616	51680	51613	51613	he	261	“ on the Mountain of Gont . We shall pass it , sailing to Havnor , if we take the northern way . It 's beautiful to see it in winter , rising all white out of the sea , like a greater wave . My village was by just such a stream as this one . Where were you born , Tenar ? ”
51681	51700	51730	51730	his	1377	“ In the north of Atuan , in Entat , I think . I ca n't remember it . ”
51701	51708	51613	51613	he	261	“ They took you so young ? ”
51709	51727	51728	51728	He	1377	" I was five . I remember a fire on a hearth , and ... nothing else . ”
51807	51817	51818	51818	he	1377	“ What are you going to do in Havnor ? ”
51832	51845	51818	51818	he	1377	“ You are — more than I had realized - truly reborn . ”
51857	51867	51853	51853	She	1380	“ You should learn the language , at least . ”
51868	51872	51853	51853	She	1380	“ Your language ? "
51873	51876	51895	51895	he	1377	“ Yes . ”
51877	51883	51853	51853	She	1380	“ I 'd like to . "
51884	51893	51895	51895	he	1377	" Well , then . This is kabat , "
51908	51919	51895	51895	he	1377	“ Kabat . Is that in the dragon - tongue ? ”
51920	51943	51895	51895	he	1377	" No , no . You do n't want to work spells , you want to talk with other men and women ! "
51944	51956	51895	51895	he	1377	“ But what is a pebble in the dragon 's tongue ? ”
51957	51960	51961	51961	he	1377	“ Tolk , ”
51964	52002	51961	51961	he	1377	“ But I am not making you my apprentice sorcerer . I 'm teaching you the language people speak in the Archipelago , the Inner Lands . I had to learn your language before I came here . ”
52003	52009	51895	51895	he	1377	“ You speak it oddly . ”
52010	52019	52021	52021	he	1377	" No doubt . Now , arkemmi kabat , "
52034	52041	52042	52042	she	1382	" Must I go to Havnor ? "
52045	52054	52042	52042	she	1382	“ Where else would you go , Tenar ? ”
52058	52065	52066	52066	he	1377	“ Havnor is a beautiful city , ”
52069	52217	52066	52066	he	1377	“ And you bring it the ring , the sign of peace , the lost treasure . They 'll welcome you in Havnor as a princess . They 'll do you honor for the great gift you bring them , and bid you welcome , and make you welcome . They are a noble and generous people in that city . They 'll call you the White Lady because of your fair 147 The Western Mountains vatched ing the than ) e into skin , and they 'll love you the more because you are so young . And because you are beautiful . You 'll have a hundred dresses like that one I showed you by illusion , but real ones . You 'll meet with praise , and gratitude , and love . You who have known nothing but solitude and envy and the dark . ”
52218	52223	52224	52224	she	1383	“ There was Manan , ”
52236	52295	52224	52224	she	1383	“ He loved me and was kind to me , always . He protected me as well as he knew how , and I killed him for it ; he fell into the black pit . I do n't want to go to Havnor . I do n't want to go there . I want to stay here . "
52296	52302	52066	52066	he	1377	“ Here - in Atuan ? ”
52303	52313	52066	52066	he	1377	" In the mountains . Where we are now . ”
52314	52317	52318	52318	he	1384	" Tenar , "
52327	52357	52321	52321	his	1384	“ we 'll stay then . I have n't my knife , and if it snows it will be hard . But so long as we can find food — ”
52358	52374	52375	52375	Tenar	164	" No . I know we ca n't stay . I 'm merely being foolish , ”
52413	52423	52424	52424	she	164	“ All I know is of no use now , ”
52427	52442	52424	52424	she	164	“ and I have n't learned anything else . I will try to learn . "
52650	52655	52656	52657	the girl	551	" What is that ? "
52663	52667	52656	52657	the girl	551	“ The sea . "
52784	52790	52791	52791	he	1289	“ Will I fool 'em ? ”
52794	52800	52791	52791	he	1289	“ How are your clothes ? ”
52825	52828	52829	52829	she	551	“ Oh , ”
52835	52845	52829	52829	she	551	“ Oh , you are — you are Ged ! ”
52878	52922	52923	52923	He	1289	" Do n't say my true name before others . Nor will I say yours . We are brother and sister , come from Tenacbah . And I think I 'll ask for a bite of supper if I see a kindly face . ”
52950	52956	52958	52958	Tenar	164	“ Do Mages often beg ? ”
52975	52981	52958	52958	Tenar	164	“ Why do you ask ? ”
52986	53001	52958	52958	Tenar	164	" You seemed used to begging . In fact you were good at it . ”
53002	53065	52958	52958	Tenar	164	" Well , yes . I 've begged all my life , if you look at it that way . Wizards do n't own much , you know . In fact nothing but their staff and clothing , if they wander . They are received and given food and shelter , by most people , gladly . They do make some return . ”
53066	53070	52958	52958	Tenar	164	“ What return ? ”
53071	53085	52958	52958	Tenar	164	“ Well , that woman in the village . I cured her goats . ”
53086	53093	52958	52958	Tenar	164	“ What was wrong with them ? ”
53094	53112	52958	52958	Tenar	164	“ They both had infected udders . I used to herd goats when I was a boy . "
53113	53123	52958	52958	Tenar	164	“ Did you tell her you 'd cured them ? ”
53124	53135	52958	52958	Tenar	164	“ No . How could I ? Why should I ? ”
53143	53156	53140	53140	she	1411	“ I see your magic is not good only for large things . ”
53157	53160	53161	53161	he	1412	" Hospitality , "
53164	53192	53161	53161	he	1412	“ kindness to a stranger , that 's a very large thing . Thanks are enough , of course . But I was sorry for the goats . ”
53329	53423	53326	53326	he	1412	“ I saw them too , as a boy . They came raiding to Gont . They came into my village , to plunder it . But they were driven off . And there was a battle down by Armouth , on the shore ; many men were are THE TOMBS OF ATUAN 150 killed , hundreds , they say . Well , perhaps now that the ring is rejoined and the Lost Rune remade , there will be no more such raiding and killing between the Kargish Empire and the Inner Lands . ”
53424	53435	53437	53437	Tenar	164	“ It would be foolish if such things went on , "
53439	53451	53437	53437	Tenar	164	“ What would the Godking ever do with so many slaves ? ”
53460	53472	53473	53473	She	164	“ If the Kargish lands defeated the Archipelago , you mean ? ”
53476	53488	53473	53473	She	164	“ I do n't think that would be likely to happen . ”
53489	53523	53326	53326	he	1412	“ But look how strong the Empire is — that great city , with its walls , and all its men . How could your lands stand against them , if they attacked ? ”
53524	53533	53534	53534	he	1289	" That is not a very big city , ”
53540	53589	53534	53534	he	1289	“ I too would have thought it tremendous , when I was new from my mountain . But there are many , many cities in Earthsea , among which this is only a town . There are many , many lands . You will see them , Tenar . "
53604	53649	53650	53650	She	1289	“ It is marvelous to see them : the new lands rising from the sea as your boat comes towards them . The farmlands and forests , the cities with their harbors and palaces , the marketplaces where they sell everything in the world . ”
53754	53762	53750	53750	She	1289	“ Will you stay with me there ? ”
53823	53923	53817	53817	He	1434	“ Tenar , I go where I am sent . I follow my calling . It has not yet let me stay in any land for long . Do you see that ? I do what I must do . Where I go , I must go alone . So long as you need me , I 'll be with you in Havnor . And if you ever need me again , call me . I will come . I would come from my grave if you called me , Tenar ! But I can not stay with you . "
53934	53949	53931	53931	he	1437	“ You will not need me long , there . You will be happy . ”
54315	54318	54319	54319	he	1461	“ Here , ”
54338	54343	54319	54319	he	1461	“ What are they ? "
54344	54365	54304	54304	He	1461	“ Mussels , off the rocks . And those two are oysters , even better . Look - like this . ”
54399	54412	54413	54413	She	164	“ You do n't even cook it ? You ate it alive ! "
54589	54595	54596	54596	He	215	“ I 'm not hungry . ”
54625	54636	54637	54637	he	215	“ About two hours till the tide 's back in , ”
54640	54659	54637	54637	he	215	“ Then we can go . You had a restless night , why do n't you sleep now . ”
54660	54666	54667	54667	He	215	“ I 'm not sleepy . "
55262	55265	55259	55259	he	261	“ Tenar , ”
55332	55343	55348	55348	his	261	“ It 's time . ... Time we were going . "
55359	55374	55375	55375	he	261	" You 'll leave them behind , Tenar . You 're going free now , "
55394	55455	55384	55384	He	261	“ Give me a hand with the boat . She 's up on logs , for rollers . That 's it , push ... again . There , there , enough . Now be ready to hop in when I say ‘ hop . ' This is a tricky place to launch from - once more . There ! In you go!”—and
55613	55616	55617	55617	he	261	“ Now , "
55620	55643	55617	55617	he	261	“ now we 're away , now we 're clear , we 're clean gone , Tenar . Do you feel it ? ”
55881	55888	55889	55889	he	215	“ That is Karego - At , ”
56126	56135	56136	56136	Tenar	164	“ If the wind is from the south , ”
56145	56153	56136	56136	Tenar	164	“ does n't the boat sail north ? ”
56154	56200	56136	56136	Tenar	164	“ Yes , unless we tack . But I 've put the mage - wind in her sail , to the west . By tomorrow morning we should be out of Kargish waters . Then I 'll let her go by the world 's wind . ”
56201	56207	56136	56136	Tenar	164	“ Does it steer itself ? ”
56209	56212	56213	56213	Ged	215	“ Yes , ”
56218	56278	56213	56213	Ged	215	“ given the proper instructions . She does n't need many . She 's been in the open sea , beyond the farthest isle of the East Reach ; she 's been to Selidor where Erreth - Akbe died , in the farthest West . She 's a wise crafty boat , my Lookfar . You can trust her . ”
56383	56401	56380	56380	she	551	“ The little island , where the talisman was given you , is that in this sea ? ”
56402	56405	56406	56406	his	1520	“ Yes , ”
56414	56430	56406	56406	his	1520	“ Somewhere . To the south , perhaps . I could not find it again . ”
56431	56447	56380	56380	she	551	“ I know who she was , the old woman who gave you the ring . "
56448	56452	56380	56380	she	551	“ You know ? "
56453	56561	56406	56406	his	1520	“ I was told the tale . It is part of the knowledge of the First Priestess . Thar told it to me , first when Kossil was there , then more fully when we were alone ; it was the last time she talked to me before she died . There was a noble house in 159 Voyage y from ouched a bels Hupun who fought against the rise of the High Priests in Awabath . The founder of the house was King Thoreg , and among the treasures he left his descendants was the half - ring , which Erreth - Akbe had given him . ”
56562	56665	56380	56380	she	551	“ That indeed is told in the Deed of Erreth - Akbe . It says ... in your tongue it says , ' When the ring was broken , half remained in the hand of the High Priest Intathin , and half in the hero 's hand . And the High Priest sent the broken half to the Nameless , to the Ancient of the Earth in Atuan , and it went into the dark , into the lost places . But ErrethAkbe gave the broken half into the hands of the maiden Tiarath , daughter of the wise king , saying : “
56690	56703	56406	56406	his	1520	” So spoke the hero before he sailed to the west . ' ”
56704	56950	56951	56951	He	1523	“ So it must have gone from daughter to daughter of that house , over all the years . It was not lost , as your people thought . But as the High Priests made themselves into the Priest - Kings , and then when the Priest - Kings made the Empire and began to call themselves Godkings , all this time the house of Thoreg grew poorer and weaker . And at last , so Thar told me , there were only two of the lineage of Thoreg left , little children , a boy and a girl . The Godking in Awabath then was the father of him who rules now . He had the children stolen from their palace in Hupun . There was a prophecy that one of the descendants of Thoreg of Hupun would bring about the fall of the Empire in the end , and that frightened him . He had the children stolen away , and taken to a lonely isle somewhere out in the middle of the sea , and left there with nothing but the clothes they wore and a little food . He feared to kill them by knife or strangling or poison ; they were of kingly blood , and murder of orer WCIC THE TOMBS OF ATUAN 160 kings brings a curse even on the gods . They were named Ensar and Anthil . It was Anthil who gave you the broken ring . ”
56958	56965	56966	56966	he	1523	“ So the story comes whole , ”
56971	57011	56966	56966	he	1523	“ even as the ring is made whole . But it is a cruel story , Tenar . The little children , that isle , the old man and woman I saw . ... They scarcely knew human speech . ”
57012	57019	56951	56951	He	1523	“ I would ask you something . "
57020	57023	56966	56966	he	1523	" Ask . ”
57024	57148	56966	56966	he	1523	" I do not wish to go to the Inner Lands , to Havnor . I do not belong there , in the great cities among foreign men . I do not belong to any land . I betrayed my own people . I have no people . And I have done a very evil thing . Put me alone on an island , as the king 's children were left , on a lone isle where there are no people , where there is no one . Leave me , and take the ring to Havnor . It is yours , not mine . It has nothing to do with me . Nor have your people . Let me be by myself ! ”
57233	57242	57226	57226	He	1525	“ What evil have you done , Tenar ? "
57243	57288	57289	57289	She	1524	" I ordered that three men be shut into a room beneath the Throne , and starved to death . They died of hunger and thirst . They died , and are buried there in the Undertomb . The Tombstones fell on their graves . ”
57292	57297	57289	57289	She	1524	“ Is there more ? ”
57298	57301	57226	57226	He	1525	“ Manan . ”
57304	57312	57289	57289	She	1524	“ That death is on my soul . ”
57313	57356	57357	57357	She	1524	“ No . He died because he loved me , and was faithful . He thought he was protecting me . He held the sword above my neck . When I was little he was kind to me — when I cried — ”
57388	57396	57397	57397	she	1524	“ I was never kind to him , "
57400	57444	57397	57397	she	1524	“ I will not go to Havnor . I will not go with you . Find some isle where no one comes , and put me there , and leave me . The evil must be paid for . I am not free . ”
57458	57608	57397	57397	she	1524	" Listen , Tenar . Heed me . You were the vessel of evil . The evil is poured out . It is done . It is buried in its own tomb . You were never made for cruelty and darkness ; you were made to hold light , as a lamp burning holds and gives its light . I found the lamp unlit ; I wo n't leave it on some desert island like a thing found and cast away . I 'll take you to Havnor and say to the princes of Earthsea , ‘ Look ! In the place of darkness I found the light , her spirit . By her an old evil was brought to nothing . By her I was brought out of the grave . By her the broken was made whole , and where there was hatred there will be peace . ”
57609	57614	57615	57615	Tenar	164	“ I will not , ”
57620	57630	57615	57615	Tenar	164	“ I can not . It 's not true ! "
57631	57636	57637	57637	he	1527	“ And after that , ”
57642	57878	57637	57637	he	1527	“ I 'll take you away from the princes and the rich lords ; for it 's true that you have no place there . You are too young , and too wise . I 'll take you to my own land , to Gont where I was born , to my old master Ogion . He 's an old man now , a very great Mage , a man of quiet heart . They call him ' the Silent . ' He lives in a small house on the great cliffs of Re Albi , high over the sea . He keeps some goats , and a garden patch . In autumn he THE TOMBS OF ATUAN 162 goes wandering over the island , alone , in the forests , on the mountainsides , through the valleys of the rivers . I lived there once with him , when I was younger than you are now . I did n't stay long , I had n't the sense to stay . I went off seeking evil , and sure enough I found it . . . . But you come escaping evil ; seeking freedom ; seeking silence for a while , until you find your own way . There you will find kindness and silence , Tenar . There the lamp will burn out of the wind awhile . Will you do that ? ”
57908	57912	57913	57913	she	1532	“ I will , ”
57926	57942	57913	57913	she	1532	“ Oh , I wish it were sooner ... that we could go there now .... "
57943	57953	57913	57913	she	1532	“ It wo n't be long , little one . "
57954	57962	57913	57913	she	1532	“ Will you come there , ever ? "
57963	57971	57913	57913	she	1532	“ When I can I will come . ”
58257	58260	58261	58261	he	215	“ Come ! ”
