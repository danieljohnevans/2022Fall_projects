Within limits , of course — but those limits are wide enough to be not very restricting . Increase them to a thousand dollars a week and you do n't feel them at all . The difference is hardly noticeable . Really . Okay , so I bought some new clothes and records and a couple other fancy toys I 'd had my eye on — but I 'd already gotten used to having as much money as I 'd needed ( or wanted ) , so having that much more in my pocket really did n't make all that difference . I had to start wearing bigger pockets , that 's all . Well — I like to travel too . Usually , about once or twice a month I 'd fly up to San Francisco for the weekend , or something like that . Palm Springs , Santa Barbara , Newport , San Diego . Follow the sun , that 's me . Since Uncle Jim increased my allowance , I 've been to Acapulco , New York , and the Grand Bahamas . And I 'm thinking about Europe . But it 's not all that fun to travel alone — and nobody I know can afford to come along with me . So I find I 'm staying home just as much as before . I could buy things if I wanted — but I 've never cared much about owning things . They need to be dusted .

I think it 's a bore . * I did n't exactly drop out of the university - I just sort of faded away . It was a bore too . 7 I found I had less and less to say to my classmates .

4235	5574	4228	4228	you	278	” * * I waited till after what's - his - name had left . Whatever it was in the box , Uncle Jim had intended it for me alone . I hefted it carefully . Perhaps this was the hundred and forty - three million- I wondered — could you put that much money into a box this small ? Maybe it was in million - dollar bills , one hundred and forty - three of them . ( I do n't know — do they even print million - dollar bills ? ) No , that could n't be — could you imagine trying to cash one ? I shuddered . Uh - uh , Uncle Jim would n't do that to me well , let 's see , maybe it was in ten - thousand - dollar bills . ( That would be fourteen thousand , three hundred of them . ) No , the box was too lightIf it was my fortune , it would have to be in some other . 14 The Man Who Folded Himself a form than banknotes . Rare postage stamps ? Precious gems ? Maybe- But I could n't imagine a hundred and forty - three million dollars ' worth of them , at least not in this box . It was too small . There was only one way to find out . I ripped away the heavy brown wrapping paper and fumbled off the top . It was a belt . A black leather belt . With a stainless - steel plate for a buckle . A belt . I almost did n't feel like taking it out of the box . I felt like a kid at Santa Claus 's funeral . This was Uncle Jim 's legacy ? I took it out . It was n't a bad - looking belt - in fact , it was quite handsome . I wondered what I could wear it with - almost anything actually ; it was that kind of style . It had a peculiar feel to it though ; the leather flexed like an eel , as if it were alive and had an electric backbone running through it . The buckle too ; it seemed heavier than it looked , and - well , have you ever tried to move the axis of a gyroscope ? The torque resists your pressure . This belt buckle felt like that . I looped it around my waist to see what it would look like . Not bad , but I had belts I liked better . I started to put it back in the box when it popped open in my hand . The buckle did . I looked at the buckle more closely . What had looked like a single plate of stainless steel was actually two pieces hinged together at the bottom , so that when you were wearing the belt you could open it up and read the dials on the inside of the front . Dials ? The thing had an electro - luminescent panel covered with numbers . It looked like clock - it was a clock . The trade- 15 mark on it said TIMEBELT . As I watched , two of the rows of numbers kept flickering , changing to keep track of the tenths of seconds , the seconds , and the minutes . Also indicated were the hours , the day , the month , the yearNot bad if it was accurate , but I already had a watch and that was good enough . Besides , this seemed such a silly idea , putting a clock in a belt buckle . You 'd feel embarrassed every time you opened it . Now , if it were a wristwatch — but whoever had built it probably could n't have put that much circuitry into so small a space . Fine . I had the world 's only belt buckle that told the time . I started to close it up again , Wait a minute — not so fast . I took a second look . There were too many numbers on that dial . There were four rows of numbers , and a row of lights and some lettering . The whole thing looked like this : [ clr ] TIMEBELT [ act ] AD 1975 May 21 13:06.43.09 J 00 0000 000 00 00 00 00 00 F 0000000000 00 000 000000000000000 T AD 1975 May 21 13:06.43.09 B AD 1975 Mar 16 17:30.00.00 ( hol ] TIMEBELT [ ret ) Odd . What were all those numbers for ? The date on the bottom , for instance : March 16 , 1975 – what was so special about that ? What had happened at 5:30 on March 16 ? I frowned ; there was something- 16 The Man Who Folded Himself I went looking for my calendar . Yes , there it was . March 16 : Uncle Jim coming at 5:30 . The date on the bottom was the last time I had seen Uncle Jim ! March 16 ! He had knocked on the door precisely at 5:30 ! Uncle Jim was always punctual when he made appointments . On the phone he had said he would be at my place at 5:30 — sure enough , he was . But why , six months later , was that date so important as to be on his calendar belt ? It did n't make sense . And there was something else I had n't noticed . The other part of the buckle — the side facing the clock — was divided into buttons . There were four rows of them , all square and flush with each other . The top row was cut into two ; the second row , six ; the third row , three ; and the bottom row , six again . My curiosity was piqued . Now , what were these for ? I touched one of the top two . The letter B on the lower right side of the panel began to glow . I touched it again and the letter F above it winked on instead . All right — but what did they mean ? I put the belt around my waist and fastened it . Actually , it fastened itself ; the back of the clasp leaped against the leather part and held . I mean , held . I tugged at it , but it did n't slip . Yet I could pop it off as easily as separating two magnets . Quite a gimmick that . The buckle was still open ; I could read the numbers on it easily . Almost automatically my hand moved to the buttons . Yes , that was right — the buttons were a keyboard against my waist , the panel was the readout ; the whole thing was a little computer But what in hell was I computing ? Idly I touched some of the buttons . The panel blinked . 17 One of the dates changed . I pressed another button and the center row of lights flickered . When I pressed the first button again , a different part of the date changed . I did n't understand it , and there was nothing in the box except some tissue paper . Maybe there was something on the belt itself . I took it off . On the back of the clasp , it said : TIMEBELT TEMPORAL TRANSPORT DEVICE Temporal Transport Device — ? Hah ! They had to be kidding . A time machine ? In a belt ? Ridiculous . And then I found the instructions . * * The instructions were on the back of the clasp — when I touched it lightly , the words TIMEBELT , TEMPORAL TRANSPORT DEVICE winked out and the first “
5576	7665	7666	7666	I	0	” of directions appeared in their place . Every time I tapped it after that , a new page appeared . They were written in a kind of linguistic shorthand , but they were complete . The table of contents ran on for several pages itself : OPERATION OF THE TIMEBELT Understanding Theory and Relations 18 The Man Who Folded Himself Time Tracking The Paradox Paradox Alternity Discoursing Protections Corrections Tangling and Excising Excising with Records Reluctances Avoidances and Responsibilities FUNCTIONS Layout and Controls Settings Compound Settings High - Order Programming Safety Features USAGES Forward in TimeBy a Specific Amount To a Particular Moment Cautions Backward in TimeBy a Specific Amount To a Particular Moment Additional Cautions Fail - Safe Functions Compound JumpsAdvanced High - Order Compound Cautions Distance JumpsMedium Range Long Range 19 Ultra Long Range Special Cautions Infinity Dangers Entropy Awareness TimeskimmingShort Range Long Range Ultra Long Range TimestopUses of the Timestop Stopping the Present Stopping the Past Stopping the Future Special Cautions on the Use of the Timestop Multiple JumpsProgramming Usage Cautions and Protections on Multiple Jumps Emergency JumpsReturns Timestops Timeskims Height and Motion Compensations ( moving vehicles and temporary heights ) Compensations ( ordinary and specific use ) General Cautions Summary ACCLIMATIZATIONS Cultures Determinations Languages Clothing Shelter 20 The Man Who Folded Himself Currency Living Patterns and Customs Religions and Taboos Health Timestop Determinations Additional Acclimatizations Cautions ARTIFACTING Transporting Special Cases Cautions I was beginning to feel a little dazed — of course this could n't be for real . It could n't be . . I sat down on the couch and began reading the directions in detail . They were easy to understand . There was a great deal about the principles of operation and the variety of uses , but I just skimmed that . First I wanted to find out how the belt worked , perhaps even try it . . The readout panel was easy enough to understand . The top row of numbers was the time now ; the second row was the distance you wished to travel away from it , either forward or back ; and the third row was the moment to which you were traveling , your target . The fourth row was the date of your last jump — that is , when the belt had last come from . ( Later I found that it could also be the date of the next jump if you had preprogrammed for it . Or it could be a date held in storage one that you could keep permanently set up and jump to at a moment 's decision . ) The letters F and B on the right side , of course , stood for Forward and Back . The letters J and T on the left side stood for Jump and Target . The lights in the center of the panel had 21 several functions ; mostly they indicated the belt 's programming . In each corner of the readout was a lettered square . These were references to four buttons on the face of the buckle itself . ( I closed the buckle and looked — there were n't any obvious buttons , but in each corner was an area that seemed to depress with a slight click . ) CLR stood for Clear , HOL meant Hold , RET was Return , and ACT was Activate . Each button had to be pressed twice in rapid succession to function ; that way you would n't accidentally change any of your settings or send yourself off on an unintended jaunt . CLR was meant to clear the belt of all previous instructions and settings . HOL would hold any date in storage indefinitely , or call it out again . RET would send you back to the moment of your last jump , or to any date locked in by HOL . ACT would do just that - act . Whatever instructions had been programmed into the belt , nothing would happen until ACT was pressed . Twice . There were more instructions . There was something called Timestop and something else called Timeskim . According to the instructions , each was an interrupted time jump resulting in a controlled out - of - phase relationship with the realtime universe . Because the rate of phase congruency could be controlled , so could the perceived rate of the timestream . What that meant was that I could view events like a motion picture film . I could speed it up and see things happening at an ultra - fast rate via the Timeskim , or I could freeze them altogether with the Timestop . The Timeskim was necessary to allow you to maintain your bearings over a long - range jump ; you could skim through time instead of jumping directly . The movement of people and animals would be a blur , but you would be able to avoid materializing inside of a building that had n't been there 22 The Man Who Folded Himself before . The Timestop was intended to help you get your bearings after you arrived , but before you reinserted yourself into the timestream , especially if you were looking for a particular moment . With everything seemingly frozen solid , you could find an unobserved place to appear , or you could remain an unseen observer of the Timestopped still life . Or you could Timeskim at the real - time rate without being a part of realworld events , again an unseen observer . I guessed that the Timestop and Timeskim were necessary for traveling to unfamiliar eras - especially dangerous ones . There were other functions too , complex things that I did n't understand yet . I decided to leave them alone for a while . For instance , Entropy Awareness left me a bit leery . I concentrated on the keyboard instead . After all , programming the belt was the most important part . The top two buttons controlled Jump and Target , Forward and Back . The second row of six controlled any six digits of the date ; the third row of three was for programming — they determined the settings of the second and fourth rows . The fourth row had six buttons ; used in combination with the third row , they determined eighteen different functions . When the top two buttons were used too , there were seventy - two different ways of using the belt . Maybe more . Each of the buttons on the keyboard was multi - functional . What it controlled and how was determined by which other buttons it was used in combination with . Clearly this timebelt was not a simple device . There was a lot to learn . * * * 23 I felt like a kid with a ten - dollar bill in a candy store - no , like an adolescent with a hundred - dollar bill in a brothel . I was ready — but what should I do first ? Possibilities cascaded across my mind like a stack of unopened presents . I was both eager and scared . My hand was nervous as I fumbled open the buckle . I eyed the readout plate warily . All the numbers had been cleared and were at zero ; they gazed right back at me . Well , let 's try something simple first . I touched the third button in the third row , setting the second row of controls for minutes , seconds and tenths of seconds . I tapped the first button in the second row twice : twenty minutes . I set the top right - hand button for Forward , the top left - hand button for Jump . I double - checked the numbers on the panel and closed the belt . Now . All I had to do was tap the upper right - hand corner of the buckle twice . The future waited . I swallowed once and tapped . -POP!- I staggered and straightened . I had forgotten about that . The instructions had warned that there would be a slight shock every time I jumped . It had something to do with forcing the air out of the space you were materializing in . It was n't bad though I just had n't been expecting it . It was like scuffing your shoes on a rug and then touching metal , that kind of shock , but all over your whole body at once . Aside from that , I had no way of proving I was in the future . Oh , wait . Yes , I did . I was still wearing my wristwatch . It said 1:43 . I strode into the kitchen and looked at the kitchen clock . 24 The Man Who Folded Himself a It said 2:03 . That 's when it hit me — I had actually traveled through time ! Twenty minutes forward ! I actually had ! Until now I 'd been treating the whole thing as a game ; not even the jump - shock had convinced me . That could have been faked by a battery in the belt . But this ! I knew my watch and I knew that kitchen clock ; they could n't have been faked . I actually had a time machine . A real live , honest - to - God working time machine . I took a deep breath and forced myself to be calm . I tried to force myself to be calm . I had a time machine . A real time machine . I had jumped twenty minutes forward . The room looked just the same , not even the quality of the afternoon sunlight had changed , but I knew I had jumped forward in time . The big question was what was I going to do next ? I had to think about this — no problem , I had all the time in the world . I giggled when I realized that . Hmm . I knew . Suddenly I realized what I could do . I opened the belt and reset the control for twenty - four hours . Forward . I would pick up a copy of tomorrow 's paper , then bounce back and go to the race track today . I would make a fortune . I would MIGOD ! Why had n't I realized this — ? I could be as rich as I wanted to be . Rich- ! The word lost all meaning when I realized what I could do . Not just the race track - Las Vegas ! The stock market ! Anything ! There were boxing matches to bet on and companies to invest in , new products from the future and rare objects from the past — my head swam with the possibilities . I wanted to laugh . And I 'd been worried about a mere hundred and forty - three million dollars ! 25 > Uncle Jim had been right after all ! I was rich ! I wanted to shout ! I felt like dancing ! The room twirled with wealth and I spun with it — until I tripped over a chair . Still gasping and giggling , I sat up . It was too much - too much ! Before — before I had proven that the belt really worked — all those possibilities had been merely fantasies : fun things to think about , but not taken seriously . Now , however , they were more than possibilities . They were probabilities . I would do them all . All ! I had all the time in the world ! I was hysterical with delight . Giddy with enthusiasmI forced myself to stop . Be serious now , I told myself . Let 's approach this properly . Let 's think these things out ; take them one at a timeTomorrow . I grinned and touched the button . - Pop!- * * This time the shock was n't so bad , 1- — There was somebody in the room . I started . Then he turned to face me . For a moment it was like staring into a sudden mirrorHe said , "
7673	7688	7666	7666	I	0	" It was me . I must have been staring , because he said , “
7693	7792	7691	7691	Dan	108	" and I jumped again . The sound of his voice — it was my voice as I 've heard it on tape . The look in his eyes — I've seen those eyes in my mirror . His face - it was my face — the features , everything : the 26 The Man Who Folded Himself nose , short and straight ; the hair , dark brown with a hint of red and with the wave that I ca n't comb out ; the mouth , wide and smiling ; the cheekbones , high and pronounced . “
7796	7822	7795	7795	me-	0	" It must have sounded inane . He was a little flustered too . He held out something he had been holding , a newspaper . "

7914	7923	7898	7900	the same person	287	" I said , blinking . He grinned . "
7931	8048	7924	7924	I	0	" I looked at him again ; he stared unabashedly back . He was almost delighting in my confusion , and he had hit on one of my most secret fantasies . Of course ! He could n't help but know - he was me ! When I had been younger , my greatest desire had been the impossible wish for an identical twin - a second me , someone whom I could talk to and share secrets with . Someone who would always be there so I would never be alone . Someone whoI gaped helplessly . It was all happening too fast . He reached out and took my hand , shook it warmly . “
8051	8055	8056	8056	I	0	” he said . “
8065	8373	8060	8060	I	0	” At first I just let him shake my hand , but after a second of his smiling at me , I returned his grip . ( Interesting — some people shake my hand and their grip is too hard . Others have a grip that 's too weak . Don 's grip was just right - but why should n't it be ? He 's me . I have to keep reminding myself of that ; it 's almost too easy to think of him as Don . ) The touch of his hand was strange — is that what I feel like ? 27 We went to the races . Oh , first we bounced back twenty - eight hours ; both of us . He flashed back first , then I followed . We both reappeared at the same instant because our target settings were identical . ( He was wearing a timebelt too — well , of course ; if I could be duplicated , so could the belt . ) I could n't shake the feeling that this fellow from the future was invading my home - even though it was meaningless — but he seemed so sure of himself that I had to follow in his wake . When I glanced at the kitchen clock , I got another start . It was just a little past ten — why , I was still at Uncle Jim 's funeral ! I 'd be coming home in an hour with the lawyer . Maybe it was a good thing that Don had taken the lead ; there was still too much I did n't know . As we walked out to the car , Mrs. Peterson , the old lady in the front apartment , was just coming out of her door . “
8378	8396	8376	8376	Danny	108	" she started , then stopped . She looked from one to the other of us confusedly . "
8402	8407	8408	8408	Don	111	” said Don quickly . “
8410	8423	8408	8408	Don	111	” he said to me , a gentle pressure on my arm , “
8429	8433	8426	8427	Mrs. Peterson	112	” To her , “
8458	8500	8501	8501	I	0	” She smiled at me . I nodded , feeling like a fool . I knew Mrs. Peterson - but Don 's grip on my arm reminded me that she did n't know . She looked back and forth , blinking . “

Well , I 'd have to deposit it later . 42 The Man Who Folded Himself Instead I withdrew two hundred and fifty dollars from my savings account so we 'd have some money for the track today . I got home with time to spare . I decided to change into some cooler clothes — then I remembered the sweater and slacks . What would happen if I wore something else instead ? I went burrowing in the closet , found some lightweight trousers , a shirt and a windbreaker . They would do just fine . Now , what else was there I had to take care of ? Nothing that I could see .

19520	22036	19499	19499	I	0	" Life is full of little surprises . Time travel is full of big ones . My worrying about paradoxes and canceled checks had been needless . If I had thought to read the timebelt instructions completely before I went gallivanting off to the past and the future , I would have known . I was right that paradoxes were impossible , but I was wrong in thinking that the timestream had to be protected from them . After all , they were impossible . It would n't have mattered whether I had given Danny a check or not ; changes in the timestream are cumulative , not variable . What this means is that you can change the past as many times as you want . You ca n't eliminate yourself . I could go back in time nineteen years and strangle myself in my crib , but I would n't cease to exist . ( I 'd have a dead baby on my hands though ... ) Look , you can change the future , right ? The future is exactly the same as the past , only it has n't happened yet . You have n't perceived it . The real difference between the two- 57 the only difference — is your point of view . If the future can be altered , so can the past . Every change you make is cumulative ; it goes on top of every other change you 've already made , and every change you add later will go on top of that . You can go back in time and talk yourself out of winning a million and a half dollars , but the resultant world is not one where you did n't win a million and a half dollars ; it 's a world where you talked yourself out of it . See the difference ? It 's slight - but it 's important . Think of an artist drawing a picture . But he 's using indelible ink and he does n't have an eraser . If he wants to make a change , he has to paint over a line with white . The line has n't ceased to exist ; it 's just been painted over and a new line drawn on top . On the surface , it does n't seem to make much difference . The finished picture will look the same whether the artist uses an eraser or a gallon of white paint , but it is important to the artist . He 's aware of the process he used to obtain the final result , and it affects his consciousness . He 's aware of all the lines and drawings beneath the final one , the layer upon layer of images , each one not quite the one — all those discarded pieces ; they have n't ceased to exist , they 've just been painted out of view . Subjectively , time travel is like that . I can lay down one timeline and then go back and do things differently the second time around . I can go back a third time and talk myself out of something , and I can go back a fourth time and change it still again . And in the end , the timestream is exactly what I 've made it — it is the cumulative product of my changes . The closest I can get to the original is to go back and talk myself out of something . It wo n't be the same world , but the difference will be undetectable . The 58 The Man Who Folded Himself difference will be in me . I - like the artist with his paintingwill be conscious of all the other alternatives that did exist , do exist , and can exist again . A world where I did not win a million and a half dollars is not the same as a world where I talked myself out of winning a million and a half dollars . The difference is Daniel Eakins . My memories are other than what they would be , so is my awareness . I am the result of the cumulative changes in my timestream . My thoughts will be altered by this awareness , and so will my actions . The world I came from is like my innocence . I can never recapture it . At best , I can only simulate it . You ca n't be a virgin twice . ( Not that I would , of course . Virginity seems like a nice state of existence only to a virgin , only to someone who does n't know any better . From this side of the fence , it seems like such a waste . I remember my first time , and how I had reacted : Why , this was nothing to be scared of at all - in fact , it 's wonderful ! Why had I taken so long to discover it ? Afterward , all the time beforehand looked so ... empty . ) According to the timebelt instructions , what I had done by altering the situation the second time around was called tangling . Mine had been a simple tangle , easily unraveled , but there was no limit to how complex a tangle could be . You can tie as many knots in a ball of yarn as you like . There really is n't any reason to unravel tangles ( according to the instructions ) because they usually take care of themselves ; but the special cautions advise against letting a tangle get too complex because of the cumulative effects that might occur . You might suddenly find that you 've changed your world beyond all recognition and possibly beyond your ability to excise . Excising is what you do when you bounce back and talk 59 yourself out of something — when you go back and undo a mistake . Like winning too much at the races . ( How about that ? I 'd been tangling and excising and I had n't even known it . ) The belt explained the impossibility of paradoxes this way : if there was only one timestream , then paradoxes would be possible and time travel would have to be impossible . But every time you make a change in the timestream , no matter how slight , you are creating another timestream . ( As far as you are concerned , it is the only timestream , because you ca n't get back to the first one . ) So when you use the timebelt , you are n't really jumping through time , that 's an illusion ; what you are doing is leaving one timestream and jumping to — no , creating — another . The second one is identical to the one you have left , including all of the changes you have made in it — up to the instant of your appearance . At that moment you have changed the second timestream into a different timestream . Your mere existence in it is a change . If you travel back in time to excise an action , you are creating that second universe at an earlier moment , but it will develop in exactly the same direction as the universe you just left , unless you take direct steps to alter that development . That the process is perceived as time travel is only an illusion , because the process is subjective . But because it 's subjective , it really does n't make any difference . It 's just as good as the real thing . Better , even ; because nothing is permanent ; nothing is irrevocable . The past is the future . The future is the past . There 's no difference between the two and either can be changed . I 'm flashing across a series of alternate worlds , creating and destroying a new one every time I bounce . 60 The Man Who Folded Himself The universe is infinite . And so are the possibilities of my life . * I am Dan . And I am Don . And sometimes I am Dean , and Dino , and Dion , and Dana . And more There 's a poker game going on in my apartment . It starts on June 24 , 1975 . I do n't know when it ends . Every time one of me gets tired , there 's another one showing up to take his place . The game is a twenty - four - hour marathon . I know it lasts at least a week ; on July 2 I peeked in and saw several versions of myself — some in their mid - twenties - still grimly playing . Okay . So I like poker . Every time I 'm in the mood , I know where there 's an empty chair . And when . Congenial people too . I know they 'll never cheat . I may have to get a larger apartment though . Five rooms is not enough . ( I need more room for the pool table . ) Strange things keep happening - no , not strange things , things that I 've learned not to question . For instance , once I saw Uncle Jim - he looked surprised and vanished almost immediately ; it startled me too . I was just getting used to the idea of his death . I had n't realized that he would have been using the timebelt too . ( But why not ? ) Another time I heard strange noises from the bedroom . When I peeked in , there was Don in bed with — well , whoever it was , she was covered by a blanket , I could n't see . He just 61 looked at me with a silly expression , not the slightest bit embarrassed , so I shrugged and closed the door . And the noises began again . I 'm not questioning it at all . I 'll find out . Eventually . Mostly I 've been concentrating on making money . Don and I ( and later , Danny and I ) have made a number of excursions into the past , as well as the future . Some of our investments go back as far as 1850 ( railroads , coal , steel ) . 1875 ( Bell Telephone ) . 1905 ( automobiles , rubber , oil , motion pictures ) . 1910 ( airlines , heavy industry , steel again ) . 1920 ( radio , insurance companies , chemicals , drugs ) . 1929 ( I picked up some real bargains here . More steel . Business machines . More radio , more airlines . More automobiles ) . 1940 ( companies that would someday be involved in computers , television , and the aerospace industry ) . Down through the decades , I bought a little here , a little there — not enough to change the shape of the world , but enough to supply me with a lifetime comfortable fortune . It was a little tricky setting up an investment firm to manage it , but it was worth the effort . When I got back to 1975 , I found I was worth- -one hundred and forty - three million dollars . Hmm . Actually , that number was meaningless . I was worth a hell of a lot more . It turned out I owned an investment monopoly worth several billion dollars , or let 's say I controlled it . What I owned was the holding company that held the holding companies . By the numbers , its value was only one hundred and forty - three million , but I could put my hands on a lot more than that if I wanted . What it meant was that I had unlimited credit . Hell ! If I wanted to , I could own the country ! The world ! 62 The Man Who Folded Himself Believe it or not , I did n't want to . I 'd lost interest in the money . It was just so much numbers . Useless except as a tool to manipulate my environment , and I had a much better tool for that . Those frequent trips to the past had whetted my appetite . I had seen New York grow - like a living creature , the city had swelled and soared ; her cast - iron façades had become concrete ; her marble towers gave way to glass - sided slabs and soaring monoliths . I became intrigued with historyI went back to see the burning of the Hindenburg . I was there when the great Zeppelin shriveled in flame and an excited announcer babbled into his microphone . I was there when Lindbergh took off and I was there when he landed . I was there when an airplane smacked into the Empire State Building , shattering glass and concrete and tumbling to the horrified streets below . It was unreal . I saw the Wright brothers ' first flight . That was unreal too . And I know what happened to Judge Crater . I saw the blast - off of Apollo 11 . It was the loudest sound I 've ever heard . And I witnessed the assassination of Abraham Lincoln . It was n't dramatic at all ; it was sad and clumsy . I was there ( via timeskim ) at Custer 's last stand . I witnessed the completion of the first transcontinental railroad . ( The guy who was supposed to pound in the gold spike slipped and fell in the mud . ) I 've seen the Chicago fire and the San Francisco earthquake . I was at the signing of the Declaration of Independence . ( How far we have come since then ... ) . 63 I saw the burning of Atlanta . And I 've seen the original uncut version of D.W. Griffith 's Intolerance and Merian C. Cooper 's King Kong . I was there the day the Liberty Bell cracked . And I saw the fall of the Alamo . I witnessed the battle of the Monitor and the Merrimac . I attended band concert of John Philip Sousa . I heard Lincoln deliver his Gettysburg Address . I recorded it on tape . I 've seen Paul Revere 's midnight ride and the Boston Tea Party . I 've met George Washington and Thomas Jefferson . And I watched Columbus come ashore . I saw Ben Franklin flying a kite on a rainy day . I was there when Bell tested his first telephone . “
22047	22095	22043	22043	I	0	" I witnessed Galileo 's experiment - when he dropped two lead balls of different weights from the tower of Pisa . I have seen performances of plays by William Shakespeare . At the Globe Theatre in London . I watched Leonardo da Vinci as he painted the “
22099	23676	22096	22097	Mona Lisa	147	” ( I will not tell you why she smiles . ) And I watched as his rival , Michelangelo , painted the Sistine Chapel . I 've heard Strauss waltzes , conducted by Strauss himself . I was at the disastrous premier of Stravinsky 's Rite of Spring . And Ravel 's Bolero too . I 've heard Beethoven 's symphonies — as conducted by Beethoven himself . And Mozart . And Bach . ( I 've seen the Beatles too . ) And the beheading of Ann Boleyn . And Thomas More . I 've seen the signing of the Magna Charta . 9 64 The Man Who Folded Himself I have visited Imperial Rome . Nero and Tiberius and Julius Caesar himself . Cleopatra was ugly . And ancient Greece . The sacking of Troy was more than a myth . I have witnessed performances of plays by Sophocles and watched as Plato taught Aristotle and Aristotle taught Alexander . I watched as Socrates drank hemlock . I have witnessed the crucifixion of one Jesus Christ of Nazareth . And more . I have seen dinosaurs . I have seen the thunder lizards walk the Earth . The Brontosaurus , the Stegosaurus , and Triceratops — and the Tyrannosaurus Rex , the most fearsome monster ever to stalk the world . I have seen the eruption of Vesuvius and the death of Pompeii . I have seen the explosion of Krakatoa . I watched an asteroid plunge from the sky and shatter a giant crater in what would someday be Arizona . I 've witnessed the death of Hiroshima by atomic fire . I 've timeskimmed from the far distant past and watched as the Colorado River carved out the Grand Canyon — a living , twisting snake of water cutting away the rock . And more . I 've been to the year 2001 . I 've been to the moon . I 've walked its surface in a flimsy spacesuit and held its dust in my hands . I 've seen the Earth rise above the Lunar Apennines . I 've visited Tranquillity Base — and flashing back to the past , I watched the Eagle land . I saw Neil Armstrong come ashore . And more . 65 I 've been to Mars . I 've been to the great hotels that orbit Jupiter , and I 've seen the rings of Saturn . I 've timeskimmed from the far past to the far future . I have seen Creation . And I have seen Entropy . From Great Bang to Great Bang — the existence of the Earth is less than a blink ; the death of the sun by nova , almost unnoticeable . I 've seen the future of mankindI like to think I understand , but I know that I do n't . The future of the human race is as alien and incomprehensible to me as the year 1975 would be to a man of Napoleon 's era . But wonderous it is indeed , and filled with marvelous things . There is nothing that I can not witness- -but there is little that I can participate in . I am limited . By my language , by my appearance , by my skin color , and my height . I am limited to life in a span of history maybe two hundred years in each direction . Beyond that , the languages are difficult : the meanings have altered , the pronounciations and usages too complex to decipher . With effort , perhaps , I can communicate ; but the farther I go from 1975 , the harder it is to make myself understood . And there are other differences . In the past , I am too tall . The farther back I travel , the shorter is the human race . In the future , I am too short - mankind 's evolution is upward . And there are still other differences . Disturbing ones . There are places where my skin is the wrong color , or my eyes the wrong shape . And there is one time in the future when I am the wrong sex . There are places where people 's faces are — different . I can witness . I can not participate . 66 The Man Who Folded Himself But witnessing is enough : I have seen more of history than any other human being . I have timeskimmed and timestopped and my journeys have been voyages of mystery and adventure . There is much that I do n't understand . There are things that are incomprehensible to one who is not of the era and the culture . But still — the proper study of man is man himself . History is more than just old gossip . It 's majesty . It 's pomp and circumstance . It 's the blare of trumpets and the stamp of boots ; the sudden cry , the smell of fear - confusion , panic , disaster- -and above all , triumph ! The triumph of man over his environment ; the continual victory of the intellect over the animal ; the unquenchable vitality of life ! Sometimes seething , sometimes dirty , sometimes unspeakably evil . But always the direction is upward . If I must taste a bitterness , it is worth it ; because I have shared the dreams . And the promise . I have seen its fulfillment . I know the truth and the destiny of the human race . It is a proud and lonely thing to be a man . * * This part , I think , may be the hardest to record . It was inevitable , I suppose , that it happened , but it has caused me to do some serious thinking . About myself . About Dan . About Don . When Uncle Jim died , I thought my life would be 67 1 changed , and I worried about the directions it might take . When I thought I had eliminated myself by a timebelt paradox , I realized how much I feared dying - I realized how much I needed to be Dan to my Don and Don to my Dan . But this , -this makes me question the shape of my whole life . What am I ? Who am I ? What am I doing to myself ? Have I made a wrong decision ? Am I moving in a strange and terrible direction ? I wish I knew . It started — when ? yesterday evening ? Time is funny when you do n't live it linearly . When I get tired , I sleep . I flip forward or backward to the nearest nighttime and climb into bed . If I 'm not tired , and it 's night , I flash to day and go to the beach . Or I jump to winter and go skiing . I stay as long as I want , or as short as I want . I stay for weeks or only a few minutes . I 'm not a slave to the clock — nor even to the seasons . What I mean is , I 'm no longer living in a straight line . I bounce back and forth through the days like a temporal ping - pong ball . I do n't even know how old I am any more . I think I 've passed my twentieth birthday , but I 'm not sure . It 's strange Time used to be a flowing river . I sailed down it and watched the shores sweep past : here , a warm summer evening , ice tinkling in lemonade glasses ; there , a cool fall morning , dead leaves crunching underfoot and my breath in frosty puffs ; a slowly shifting panorama . But I was only a leaf in the water . I was carried helplessly along , I was a victim of the current . Now I 'm out of the river and standing on the bank ; time . 68 The Man Who Folded Himself a is no longer a moving entity to me , but a vast spread - out landscape . I can leap to any point on it at will . Do I like that summer day ? Yes , here it is . Am I in the mood for a fall morning ? Ah , that 's nice . I do n't have to wait for the river to carry me to a place where I might be able to find that moment — I can go exactly to it . No moment can ever escape me . I 've chased twilight and captured dawn . I 've conquered day and tamed the night . I can live as I choose because I am the master of time . I laugh to think of it . Time is an everlasting smorgasbord — and I am the gourmet , picking here , choosing there , discarding this unnecessary bit of tripe and taking an extra piece of filet instead . But even this temporal mobility — no matter how unlimited it is — does not keep me from arbitrarily dividing things into "

23683	23727	22096	22097	Mona Lisa	147	" That is , it must be a human thing to want to divide eternity into bite - sized chunks . It 's easier to digest . So no matter how many jumps I make , anything that happened before my last sleep happened “

23818	23908	22043	22043	I	0	" so as to enjoy the beach a little longer , I find my body tends to obey the local time , not mine . Perhaps Man is unconsciously geared to the sun . At least , it seems that way . I do n't get tired until after the world gets dark . ) ( But like I said before , I 'm not sure how old I am any more . I 've lost track . ) Anyway . What I 'm getting to is that this happened “
23911	24260	22043	22043	I	0	” Don and I were listening to Beethoven . ( The original Bee- 69 > thoven . I had gotten a recorder from 2010 , a multi - channel device capable of greater fidelity than anything known in 1975 , and had taped all eleven of the master 's symphonies . Yes . All eleven . ) We had spent the day swimming - skinny - dipping actually ( it 's strange to watch your own nude body from a distance ) , and now we were resting up before dinner . I have this mansion in the hills overlooking the San Fernando Valley ; the view is fantastic , even the bedroom has a picture window . It was dusk . The sun was just dipping behind the hills to the west . It was large and orange through the haze . Don had turned on the stereo and collapsed exhaustedly on the bed ( a king - size water bed ) without even toweling off . I did n't think anything of it . I was tired too . I made an attempt to dry myself off , then lay down beside him . ( I 'd gotten into a very bad habit with Don — with Dan — with myself . I 'd discovered I did n't like being alone . Even when I sleep , I need the assurance of knowing there 's somebody next to me . So more and more I found myself climbing into bed with one or more versions of myself . Sometimes there 's a lot of horseplay and giggling . What did I want ? Did I know ? Is that why I did it ? It extends to other things too . I wo n't swim alone . And several times I 've showered together , ostensibly so we could scrub each other 's back . ) We were both stretched out naked on the water bed , just staring at the ceiling and listening to the Pastoral Symphony , that part near the beginning where it goes “
24273	24529	22043	22043	I	0	" ( You know , where Disney 's joyous trumpets announce a cascade of happy unicorns . ) It was very relaxing . We had this giant electric hookah ( 1997 ) and we were passing the mouthpiece back and forth . It was very good grass ; I was pleasantly floating , and the light a 70 The Man Who Folded Himself show on the ceiling was swirling in red and pink and purple , shifting to blue and white . I 'd been getting strange vibrations from Don all day . I was n't sure why . ( Or perhaps I had n't wanted to admit- ) He kept looking at me . His glance kept meeting mine and he seemed to be smiling about some inner secret , but he would n't say what it was . He touched me a lot too . There had been a lot of clowning around in the pool , and once I thought a he had been about to — ( I must have sensed it earlier , I must have ; but I must have been refusing to recognize it . ) The symphony had reached that point where it suggests wild dancing , with several false stops , when a soft pop ! in the air made me look up . Another Don . I had long since gotten used to various versions of myself materializing and disappearing at random . But I sat up anyway . He looked troubled . And tired . “
24537	24546	24547	24547	You	476	” he said . He looked at me . "
24554	24620	24552	24552	you	476	" I nodded . Don , beside me , raised up on one elbow , sending ripples through the bed , but his gaze was veiled . Don II looked at him but stepped toward me . He was holding a sheaf of papers — I recognized it as my , no , his - diary ; that is , his version of my diary . “

The early parts were identical to mine , even up to the point where Don and I were listening to Beethoven , stretched out on the water bed > * What I 'm trying to get at is that it happened almost accidentally . We were pleasantly floating on top of a marijuana high . The music gave it a soft glow . We passed the mouthpiece of 72 The Man Who Folded Himself the water pipe back and forth and watched the colors slide across the ceiling . When the pipe went out , Don leaned across me to put it on the end table , but instead of pulling back , he just sighed and stretched out next to me , one arm across my chest . Absent - mindedly I reached up and stroked his arm . In response , he gave me a casual hug . And then he was looking at me and our eyes were locked in another of those mysterious glances . He was all smiles . “
25204	25372	25373	25373	Don	111	" I asked . In answer , he slid himself upward and kissed me . Just a kiss . Quick , affectionate — and loaded with desire . He pulled back and looked at me , still smiling , watching my reaction . I was confused . Because I had accepted it . I had let him kiss me as if it were a totally natural thing for him to do . I had n't questioned it at all . His eyes were shining , and I studied them carefully . He lowered his face to mine again This time the kiss was longer . Much longer . And he did n't just kiss me . He slid his arms around me and pulled me to him . And I helped We stretched out side by side , facing each other on the water bed . We put our arms around each other . And we kissed . I realized I liked it . I liked it . “

37204	39065	39066	39066	Danny	98	” * * * The sensuousness of sex . The maleness of me . The femaleness of her . The physical sensations of strength and warmth . Flesh against smooth flesh . Firm resistance , supple yielding . Sex with Diane is different from any kind of sex I have ever had before . There is something boyish about her that I find strangely attractive , yet deliciously feminine . ( I put my arms around her and she is neither male nor female , but a little of each . And there is something feminine in me that she responds to . Perhaps it is a quality that is common to both of us and independent of physical gender . An androgynous quality . My body may be male or it may be female , but I am neither - I am me . ) I keep thinking of Danny , and it is hard not to make comparisons between the two of them , even though I know it is unfair to both . But Danny and I ( Don and I ) have been through so much together , have meant so much to each other ... Diane lacks Danny 's intensity ( yes ) , but Danny could never match her sensuality . The sheer physical delight of her body , the perfect matching of male to female , the tenderness of her response ; all of these combine to make sex with her an 113 experience that is new to me . I delight in being with her , in being inside of her , just as she delights in opening to me . That yearning slit ... I see her as something special . Not a new person , no , but another reflection of myself . Another Danny perhaps — and in the most different guise of all . Yes . Danny with a vagina . Think of her as he . It is the quality of Danny - ness I see in him that is so intriguing , so independent of sexuality . There is a Danny trapped inside that female body screaming to let me in . Just as there is a Diane inside me . I can not help but like it . We enjoy our physical roles as we have never enjoyed them before ; at least I know I do ; but deep inside is a sense of - loss . I think I loved my Danny more . And I think I know why . With Danny , the physical forms were identical ; the mental roles could be arbitrary . It was just me and him . I did n't have to be male , I did n't have to be dominant . With Don I could be weak , with Don I could cry . With Diane , I am limited to one role only ; the physical determines it ; I must be a man to her woman . ( Danny is a woman . Danny has limited our roles . ) There is no other relationship for either of us . The relationship is not unenjoyable . Indeed , it is the most joyous of all . But still , there is that sense of loss . * * * We have been together how long ? Months , it must be . 114 The Man Who Folded Himself We have a home on the edge of prehistory , a villa on the shores of what someday will be called Mission Bay . It 's a sprawling mansion on a deserted coast , a self - contained unit ; it has to be , because we brought it back to the year 2000 B.C. A honeymoon cottage for the outcasts of time . The sea washes blue across yellow sands . Sea gulls wheel and dive , cawing raucously . The sun is bright in an azure sky . And the only footprints are ours . We live a strange kind of life in our timeless world . Loneliness is unknown to us ; yet neither of us ever lacks for privacy . We see each other only when both of us want it . Never can one force himself on the other . That 's part of being a time traveler . I can not journey to her future , nor can she to mine . When we bounce forward , I am in Danny 's world , she is in Diane 's . The only place we can meet is in the past , because only the past is unaffected by both of us . Should either of us need to be alone , we simply bounce to a different point in time . ( I have seen the ruins of this mansion standing forlorn and alone , swept by the sands and washed by the sea , while the sun lies orange in the west . These walls will be dust by the time of Christ . ) Returning , I am in her arms again . I am there because I want to be there . She vanishes too , but only momentarily ; she returns in a different dress and hair style . I know she has been gone longer than I have seen , but I know she comes back to me with her desire at its fullest . I open my arms . We have never had an argument . It is impossible when either of you can disappear at the instant of displeasure . All of our moments are happy ones . Life with Diane is almost idyllic . Almost . 115 Today she told me she was pregnant . And I 'm not sure how I feel about that . There is a sense of joy and wonder in me - but I am also disturbed . Jealous that something else , someone else , can make her glow with such happiness . The look on her face as she told me , I have seen that intensity only in her climax . I know I should n't be , but I am bothered that I can not give her such prolonged intensity of joy . And I am bothered that someone else is inside her . Someone other than me . And yet , I 'm happy . Happy for her , happy for me . I do n't know why , but I know that this baby must be something special . It must be . * * * The baby proves something that I have suspected for a long time . My life is out of control . I am no longer the master of my own destiny . There is little that I can do with this situation . Except run from it . Or can I ... ? * * Being pregnant is a special kind of time . Within me there is life , helpless and small ; I can feel it move . I can feel it grow . I wait eagerly for the day of its en- 116 The Man Who Folded Himself trance into this world so I can hold it and touch it . Love it and feed it , hold it to my breasts . This is a special baby . It will be . I know it will be . I am filled with wonder . I see my body in the mirror , swollen and beautiful . I run my hands across my bulging stomach in awed delight . This is something Donna could never have given me . ( I miss her though ; I wish she were here to share this moment . She is , of course . She will be here when I need her . ) Oh , there is discomfort too , more than I had expectedthe difficulties in bending over and walking , the back pains and the troubles in the bathroom , the loginess and the nausea — but it 's worth it . When I think of the small beautiful wonder which will soon burst into my life , the whole world turns pink and giggly . I feel that I 'm on the threshold of something big . * The baby was born this morning . It was a boy . A beautiful , handsome , healthy boy . I am delighted . And disappointed . I had wanted a girl . A girl . . * In 1993 the first genetic - control drug was put on the market . It allowed a man and woman to choose the sex of their unborn child . 117 In 2035 in - utero genetic tailoring became practical . The technique allowed a woman to determine which of several available chromosomes in the egg and sperm cells would function as dominants ; the only provision was that the tailoring must be done within the first month of pregnancy . In 2110 extra - utero genetic tailoring was widespread . The process allowed the parent to program the shape of his offspring . A computer - coded germ plasm could be built , link by amino - acid link , implanted into a genetically neutral egg , then carefully cultured and developed , eventually to be implanted in a womb , real or artificial . I do not want to design a whole child . I just want a baby girl . I want her identical to me . I will have to go back and see Diane before she gets pregnant , but that should be the easy part . I will not tell Dan this ; I think this is a decision that I have to make myself . The baby is mine and so is the decision . My son will be a girl . * The baby was born this morning . It was a girl . A beautiful , pink little girl . I am delighted . And disappointed . I had wanted a boy . A boy . * 118 The Man Who Folded Himself I will not tell Diane this ; this is a decision that I have to make myself . ( And there are ways that it can be done so that she will never know . I know when the child was conceived and I know which drugs to take beforehand . I will have to either replace Danny , or make him take the injection , but she will never suspect . ) My daughter will be a son . * * Why do I keep coming back ? I get on her nerves , she gets on mine . We argue about the little things ; we make a point of fighting with each other . Why ? Last night we were lying in bed , side by side , just lying there , not doing anything , just listening to each other breathe and staring at the ceiling . She said , “
39068	39072	39066	39066	Danny	98	" I said , “
39075	39079	39066	39066	Danny	98	" She said , "
39088	39092	39066	39066	Danny	98	" I nodded . “
39095	39119	39066	39066	Danny	98	" She turned to me then and slid her arms around me . Her cheeks were wet too . I held her tight . “
39124	39128	39120	39120	I	0	” I said . “
39137	39141	39142	39142	Me	0	” She sniffed . “
39145	40701	39142	39142	Me	0	" We held onto each other for a long time . After a while I shifted my position , then she shifted hers . She rolled over onto her back and I slid on top of her . She was so slender , so intense . Her hand stroked me gently , then guided me in . We moved together in silence , only the sound of our breathing . 119 We remembered and pretended , each of us lost in our own thoughts , and wishing it had n't come to this . The sheets were cool in the night and she was warm and silky . If only it could be like this all the time But it could n't . It was over . We both knew it . . . I 'm not going back any more . Whatever there was between us is gone . We both know it . The bad moments outweigh the good . There is no joy left . Besides , she is n't there all the time anyway . I have brought my son forward with me ; I will find him a home in the twentieth century . And I will watch over him . I will be very careful not to accidentally excise him . He is all i have left . It 's not without regret that I do this . I miss my Diane terribly . But something happened to us ; the magic disappeared , the joy faded , and the delight we had found in each other ceased to exist . The last night . . . we made love mechanically , each seeking only our own physical satisfaction . Somehow , my feelings had become more important to me than hers . I wonder why ? Was it because I knew that I would never — could never -experience it from her side ? Perhaps . Love with Diane was . . . sad . I could see the me in her , but I could never be that me . And that meant that she was n't really me . Not really . She was — somebody else . 120 The Man Who Folded Himself I could n't communicate with her . We used the same words , but our meanings were different . ( They must have been different . She was n't me . ) I 'm sorry , Diane . I wanted it to work . I did . But I could n't reach you . I could n't reach you at all . I So . I 'll go back to my Danny . He 'll understand . He 's been waiting patiently for so long . * Oh God , I feel alone . * It 's been years since I last added anything to this journal . I wonder how old I am now ; I really have no way of telling . Forty ? Fifty ? Sixty ? I 'm not sure . The neo - procaine treatments I 've been taking in 1991 seem to retard all physical evidence of aging . I could still be in my late thirties . But I doubt it . I 've done so much . Seen so much . I 've been living linearly - semi - linearly . Instead of bouncing haphazardly around time , I 've set up a home in 1956 , and as it travels forward through time at its stately day - to - day pace , I am traveling with it . Oh , I 'm still using the future and the past , but not as before . Before , I was young , foolish . I was like a barbarian at the banquet . I gulped and guzzled ; I ate without tasting . I rushed 121 through each experience like a tourist trying to see twentyone European cities in two weeks and enjoying none of them . Now I 'm a gourmet . I savor each day . I taste the robustness of life , but not so hurriedly as to lose its delicate overtones . I 've given up the hectic seventies for the quiet fifties — the fifties are as early as I dare go without sacrificing the cultural comforts I desire . They are truly a magic moment in time , a teeterboard suspended between the wistful past and the soaring future . The fifties are a great time to live . They are close enough to the nation 's adventurous past to still bear the same strident idealism , yet they also bear the shape of the developing future and the promise of the technological wonders to come . Transistor radios are still marvelous devices and color television is a delicious miracle , but blue skies are commonplace and the wind blows with a freshness from the north that hints a at something wild — and suggests that the city is only a temporary illusion , a mirage glowing against a western desert . Brave highways crisscross the state — and strangely , with a minimum of billboards , it seems . The roads are still new ; they are the foundation for the great freeways of the future . This is the threshold of that era , but it is still too soon for them to be overburdened with traffic and ugliness . Driving is still an adventure . The hills around Los Angeles are still uncut and green with the city 's own special color of vegetation . Dark trees and dry grass . A cool kind of day . The fifties are a peaceful time , a quiet sleeping time between two noisy bursts of years , a blue and white time filled with sweet yellow days , music and bright - smelling memories ... Actually , it 's 1961 as I write this . The fifties have ended and their magic is fading quickly . A young President has 122 The Man Who Folded Himself stamped a new dream on the nation and the frenetic stamp and click of the seventies can already be heard . The years are impatient ; they tumble over each other like children , each rushing eagerly for its turn — and each in turn tumbling inexorably into the black whirlpool of forevertime lost . Well , not lost , not to me . I have watched the fading of the fifties three times now , and perhaps I shall return again for a fourth . Perhaps . . * * * Last week , in a mood of wistfulness for times lost , I went jaunting again . I went back to the past , to the house where Diane and I lived for such a short , short , long time . One of the walls had collapsed and the wind blew through the rooms . A fine layer of clean , dry dust covered everything . The pillars and drapes stood alone on the cold plain . My own doing , of course . I had not come back far enough , but I was afraid if I journeyed too far back , I would see her again . And yet — I do want to see her again . Just a little bit farther back ... * And this time the house was not ruined . Just abandoned . Empty and waiting . My footsteps knocked hollowly across the marble floors . 123 Was she here ? Had she been here at all ? There was no way of knowing . I found my way to her rooms . Despite the acrid sunlight , her chambers were cold . I opened closets at random , pulled out drawers . Many of her silks were still here . Forgotten ? Or just discarded ? A shimmering dress , ice - cream pastel and deep forestgreen - I pressed my nose into the sleek shining material , seeking a long - remembered smell , a sweet - lemony fragrance with an undertone of musk . The clean smell of a woman Her smell is there , but faint . I dropped the dress . I am touched with incredible sadness . And then a sound , a step I ran for the other room , calling . But there was no one there . Perhaps , perhaps , just a little bit farther back . The day after the last day I was there . So many years ago ... * The air conditioner hums . The house is alive again . And my Diane is beautiful , even prettier than I remembered . Her auburn hair shimmers in the sunlight . She moves with the grace of a goddess , and she wears even less , a filmy thing of lace and silk . I can see the sweet pinkness of her skin . She has n't seen me yet . I am here in the shadows , deep within the house . It has been too long . It hurts too much to watch . 124 The Man Who Folded Himself 7 Abruptly , puzzlement clouds her face . She comes rushing in from the patio . “

41474	41487	41488	41488	Diane	187	" But she was gone . She had fled into the bedroom . “
41489	43534	43535	43535	They	811	” And then the gentle pop ! of air rushing in to fill an empty space told me how completely she was gone . How far she had fled . 126 The Man Who Folded Himself Oh God . What have I done ? * * * I could try again . All I need do is go back just a little earlier . I would n't make the same mistake this time . I want my Diane . I must have my Diane . I will have my Diane . * * * He 's tried to talk me out of it , but I 'm not going to let him stop me . I know why he wants to keep me from going back . He 's jealous of her . Because she 'll have me and he wo n't . But his way is wrong . I know that now . A man should have a woman . A real man needs a real woman . Diane , sweet Diane . Please do n't reject me again . I 'm not old . I 'm not . And you 're so young : * * * 127 Oh God , why ? Am I really that old and ugly ? No . I ca n't be . I ca n't be . Do I dare go back and try again ? * And again he tries to talk me out of it . Damn him anyway ! * * * Somewhere there is a Dan who is getting older and older . And he 's working his way back through time , chasing Diane . And each time Diane is that much younger and he 's that much older . The gulf between them widens . Widens . Oh , my poor , poor Dan . But he wo n't listen . He just wo n't listen . I 'm afraid to think of where he is heading . He 'll work his way back through all the days of Diane , and every day she 'll reject him . And Dan , poor Dan , he 'll experience them all . Each time she rejects him will be the last day she 'll spend in the fading past . So every day he 'll go back one more day , and every day he 'll be too old for herUntil he gets back to the very first day . And then she 'll be gone . There wo n't be any Diane at all . Just a memory . And , in the end , he 'll be there waiting for her - even be- 128 The Man Who Folded Himself fore the first Danny . Waiting patiently for her first appearance , trying to re - create his lost love . But she wo n't show up . No , she 'll have warned herself . Do n't go back in time looking for a variant Diane . A grizzled old ghoul waits for you . No , she 'll never come back at all . Poor Dan . Poor , poor Dan . * And yet , the one I feel sorriest for is young Dan . He 'll never know what he 's missing . Because , when he gets there , there wo n't be anyone there at all . He 'll never have a Diane . Ever . Old Dan will have chased them all away . * I wish I could change it all . I wish I could . But I ca n't . Dammit . Now I know what it 's like to have an indelible past one that wo n't be erased and changed at will . It 's frustrating . It 's maddening . And it makes me wish I had been more careful and thoughtful . But when you can erase your mistakes in a minute , you tend to get careless . Until you make one you ca n't erase . I feel uneasy because I think I did n't try hard enough , and 129 yet , I ca n't think of anything I did n't do . I tried everything I could do to stop old Danny . But it was n't enough , and now I 'm left with the results of what he 's done . We 're all left with those results . I could find young Danny in a minute , and I could warn him to go back to Diane right away , before it 's too late , before he gets too old ; but it would n't do any good . All he would find would be old Danny , sitting and waiting . Sitting and waiting . Diane is gone . Forever . There 's no way we can reach her . Old Danny has seen to that . And there 's no other place to look for her . Any time . Any place . Any when that Diane might have thought to visit , there 's an old Danny . Sitting and waiting . I 'll never see my Diane again . ( Can I content myself with Danny ? My Danny ? I 'll have to . ) * * And yet , I wonder Perhaps somewhere there is an older Diane , one who has aged like me . I wonder how I might find her . * * Ah , but that way lies old Danny and madness . It 's not the answer . 130 The Man Who Folded Himself There is a party at my house , the big place in 1999 . A hundred and fifty - three acres of forest , lake , and meadow . I do n't know how many me 's there are . The number varies . The party is spread out across the whole summer . Several days in April and May , quite a few in June and July , and also some in August . I think there may be some in September too . Generally it starts about ten in the morning and lasts until I do n't know when . It seems as if there 's always a constant number of Dans and Dons arriving and leaving . It 's like Grand Central Terminal , with passengers arriving and departing all the time , to and from destinations all over the world . Only , all the passengers are me and all the destinations are the same place , only years removed . The younger Dans show up in May and June . They like the swimming and water - skiing and motorcycling . They like the hiking and climbing and open - air barbecues . They like the company of each other . I prefer July . Most of the younger versions have faded by then . They 're too nervous for me and they remind me too much of — Diane . They 're too active , I ca n't keep up with them , and sometimes I think they 're talking on a different plane . I prefer the men of July ; they 're more my age , they 're more comfortable , and they 're more moderate . We still do a lot of swimming and riding ; I remember , I used to enjoy that very much ; but most of the time we just like to take it easy . I do n't like the men of August . I 've been there a few times , and they 're too sedentary . No , they 're too old . They just sit around and drink . And talk . And drink some more . Some of them look positively wasted . Actually , it 's the men of late August I really do n't like . 131 The men of early August are n't that bad . It 's just the old ones that bother me . Some of them are — filthy . Their minds , their mouths , their bodies . They want to touch me too much . And they call me their Danny , their little boy . ( Several of them even seem senile . ) The men of early August are all right . They make me a little uncomfortable , but lately I 've been visiting them more and more . Partly because it seems as if the younger men are taking over July and partly because I 'm in August enough now to compensate for the older ones . Several of them are very nice though . Very understanding . We 've had some interesting talks . ( And that surprises me too — that there are still things I can talk about with myself . I had thought I would have exhausted all subjects of conversation long ago . Apparently not . ) In the evenings we go indoors ( there 's a pool inside too ) and listen to music ( I have several different listening rooms ) or play poker , or pool , or chess . When I get tired ( and when I want to sleep alone ) , there 's a chart on the wall indicating which days and which beds are still unused . ( The chart covers a span of several years . Well , I have to sleep somewhere . . . ) I make a mark in any space still blank and that closes that date . Then I bounce to that point of time . ( Generally I try and use those days in serial order . I have servants in the house then and it would n't do to confuse them . ) I 'm still doing most of my living in the fifties , but when I 'm in the mood for a party — and that 's been more and more lately — I know where to find one . The poker games , for instance , are marathons . Or maybe it 's only one poker game that 's been going on since the party started . Whenever I get tired and want to quit , there 's always a later me waiting for the seat . ? 132 The Man Who Folded Himself But my endurance is n't what it used to be . I get tired too fast these days . That 's why I find the men of August so restful . On August 13 a very strange thing happens . Has happened . Will happen . I 'd known about it for some time — that is , I 'd known that something happens , because I do n't attend the party linearly . I stay in a range of a week or two and bounce around within it ; there 's more variety that way . After August 13 the mood of the party is changed . Subdued . Almost morbid . Most of me seem to know why , but they do n't refer to it very often . The last time something like this happened was just before I met Diane - when all the other versions of me had disappeared . I knew something was about to happen , but I did n't know what until I got there . I have that same kind of feeling now . Too many of the older me 's are acting strange . Very strange . The more I hang around them , the more I see it . I 'm going to have to investigate August 13 . * * Is this it ? Three or four of the youngest Dannys are here ; they 're in a quieter mood than usual though , almost grim . 133 A couple of us frowned at them — they really were n't welcome here ; they should have stayed in their own part of the party — but most of the rest of us tried at least to tolerate them , hoping that they would lose interest soon and go back to their own time . "
43543	43549	43535	43535	They	811	" complained one of me . "
43560	43564	43552	43554	some of us	813	” snapped another . "

43580	43731	43574	43574	I	0	" And then there was a pop ! as another me appeared . It was a common enough sound . Somebody was always appearing or disappearing at any given moment . But this one was different . A hush fell over the room . I turned and saw two of me reaching to support a third who had suddenly appeared between them . He was pale and gray ; he was half slumped and holding his heart . Apparently the jump - shock had been too much for him ; that sudden burst of temporal energy jolts you every time you bounce through time . They helped him to a chair . Somebody was already there with a glass of water , somebody who had been through this before , I guess . And the younger Dans were murmuring among themselves ; was this what they had come to see ? “
43740	43794	43737	43738	old fellow	815	” someone asked the newcomer . He grunted . He was old . He was very old . His hands were thin and weak . His forearms were parchment - covered bones , so were his legs . The skin of his face hung in folds and he was mottled with liver spots . “

My old man was there , of course . A dozen times over . Wrinkled , gnarled , and white . Their hands hovered in the air , or scrabbled across their laps like spiders . They clawed , they plucked . But not all of them were that old . There were one or two that even looked familiar . "
44798	44842	44843	44843	Dan	194	” I asked one who was wearing a faded shirt . If I remembered correctly , he had gotten that ketchup stain on it just a few hours ago at the poker table of the thirteenth . He looked at me , startled . “

44880	44888	44869	44869	You	194	" I tried to draw him aside . “

44945	44951	44940	44940	I	0	" he said to Don . "
44954	44969	44940	44940	I	0	" Don said , and fled in relief . I looked at the other . "
44976	44986	44940	44940	I	0	” He looked at the clock in his timebelt . “
44997	45011	44992	44992	you	194	” He took me by the arm and led me across the room . “
45042	45600	45603	45603	they	840	” I shut my mouth and watched . The air in the room was heavy . The few conversations still going were whispered , and the supposedly silent hum of the air conditioner was deafening . Almost all of these wrinkled faces , pale faces , were deathly . The few tan ones stood out like spotlights . They were grim too . The old men . Their eyes were like holes in lampshade faces , but nothing glowed within . Their expressions were bleary . Uniform . Frightened . And there were so many of them . More and more ; the room was filling up . This house , so often a happy place , was now a cloister house of the infirm . The laughter of youth had shaded into the garish cackling of senility . What had been a firm grip on life had degenerated into a plucking and desperate claw , scratching on the edge of terror . Who were these men — why could I not accept what I was seeing ? And what drove them together here ? How old am I ? ( And here is the fear- ) I do n't know . I do n't know . Am I one of the tan faces or the pale ones ? Does my skin hang in pale folds , bleached by age ? ( I touch my cheek hesitantly . ) 138 The Man Who Folded Himself As the air pops ! softly- — and the body that crumples to the floor is me . * Of course . It was the jump - shock that killed him . Will kill me . He was old . The oldest of them all . ( But not so old as to be distinguishable from the rest . He could have been any of them . ) There was silence in the room . Then a soft shadowed sigh , almost a sound of relief , as too many ancient lungs released their burden of breaths held too long . They 'd been expecting this , waiting for it - eagerly?—the curiosity of the morbid draws them again and again until the room is crowded with fearful old men . Each praying that , somehow , this time it wo n't happen . And each terrified that it will . And perhaps — perhaps each is most afraid that the next time he comes to this moment , he will not be a witness , but the guest of honor himself ... * Two of the younger men ( younger ? They were older than I – or were they ? ) moved to the body . It was still warm , but cooling rapidly . One of them clicked the belt open ; the last setting on it was for 5:30 , March 16 , 1975 . ( Meaningless , of 139 course . He could have come from there , or it could have been a date held in storage . There was no way of knowing . ) They took charge efficiently , as if they had done this before . Many times before . ( And in a way , they had . ) They slung the body between them , tapped their belts , and vanished . "
45610	45620	45603	45603	they	840	" I asked the Don in the business suit . “
45638	45639	45603	45603	they	840	” "
45642	45648	45603	45603	they	840	" He shook his head . “

45677	45678	45681	45681	me	0	" “
45683	45690	45681	45681	me	0	” He gripped my arm firmly . “
45704	45705	45699	45701	None of us	843	” "
45709	45710	45699	45701	None of us	843	" “
45717	45721	45722	45722	Others	210	” he said . “
45738	46861	46862	46862	me	0	” After I thought about it awhile , I guessed I did . * As for me ... I 'm almost afraid to use the timebelt now . * 140 The Man Who Folded Himself But now I know who I am . I guess I 've known for some time . I 'm not sure when I realized ; it was a gradual dawning , not a sudden flash of aha . I just sort of slipped into it as if it had been waiting for me all my life . I 'd been heading toward it without ever once stopping to consider how or why . And even if I had , would it have changed anything ? I do n't think so . At first I tried to ignore the events of August 23 . I went back to the earlier days of the party , but burdened as I was with the knowledge of what lurked only a few weeks ahead , I could not recapture the mood . ( And that was sensed by the others ; I was shunned as being an irritable and temperamental old variant . Nor was I the only one ; there were several of us . We put a damper on the party wherever we went . ) For a while I brooded by myself . For a while I was terribly scared . In fact , I still am . I do n't want to die . But I 've seen my own dead body . I 've seen myself in the act of dying . Death comes black and hard , rushing down on me from the future , with no possible chance of escape . I wake up cold and shuddering in the middle of the night , and were it not for the fact that I am always there to hold and comfort myself , I would go mad . ( And I still may do so ) Uncle Jim once told me that a man must learn to live with the fact of his own mortality . A man must accept the fact of death . But does that mean he must welcome it ? I 'd thought that the measure of the success of any life form was its ability to survive in its ecological niche . But I 'd been wrong . That does n't apply to individuals , not at allonly to species as a whole . 141 If you want to think in terms of individuals , you have to qualify that statement . The measure of the success of any individual animal is based on its ability to survive long enough to reproduce . And care for the young until they are able to care for themselves . I have met half that requirement . I 've reproduced . ( It 's said that the only immortality a man can achieve is through his children . I understand that now . ) I went back to 1956 to bring up my son . He was right where I had left him . I named him Daniel Jamieson Eakins , and I told him I was his uncle . His Uncle Jim . Yes . That 's who I am . In many ways , Danny is a great joy to me . I am learning as much from him as he is learning from me . He is a beautiful child and I relish every moment of his youth . I relive it by watching it . Sometimes I stand above his crib and just watch him sleep . I yearn to pick him up and hug him and tell him how much I love him — but I let him sleep . I must avoid smothering him . I must let him be his own man . And I yearn to leap ahead into the future and meet the young man he will become . It will be me , of course , starting all over again . Wondrously , I have come full circle . Once more I am in a timeline where I exist from birth to death . So I must avoid tangling it . I will try to live as serially as possible for my child . ( No , that 's not entirely true . Several times I have bounced forward and observed him from a distance . But only from a distance . ) On occasion I still flee to the house in 1999 . But I no longer do so desperately . I go only for short vacations . Very short . I know what awaits me there . But I also know that I will live to see my son reach manhood , so I am not as fearful 142 The Man Who Folded Himself as I once was . I know I have time ; so death has lost its immediacy . And the party has changed too . The mood of it is no longer so morbid . Not even grim . Just quiet . Waiting . Yes , many of these men have come here to die . No — to await death in the company of others like themselves . They help each other . And that 's good . ( I do n't need their help , not yet , so right now I can be objective about it . Maybe later , I wo n't . ) So I 'm relaxed . At ease with myself . Happy . Because I know who I am . I 'm Dan and Don and Diane and Donna . And Uncle Jim too . And somewhere , Aunt Jane . And little Danny . I diaper him ; I powder his pink little fanny and wonder that my skin was ever that smooth . I clean up his messes . My messes . I 've been doing that all my life . I 'm my own mother and my own father . I 'm the only person who exists in my world — but is n't it that way for all of us ? Me more than anyone . How did this incredible circle get started ? ( Or has it always existed ? Could it have begun in the same way the timebelt began in a world that I excised out of existence ? In a place so far distant and so almost - possible that the traces of the might - have - been are buried completely in the already - is ? ) Many years ago I pondered the reason for my own existence . ( Why “
46863	46868	46869	46869	me	0	” ? Why me as “
46870	46885	46886	46886	me	0	” ? Why do I perceive myself - and why do I experience me as "
46887	48105	48106	48107	Uncle Jim	102	" and not someone else ? Why was I born at all ? It could have been anyone ! ) It almost drove me mad . I had to have a meaning . I was sure I had to . Variants of me did go mad seeking that meaning — but only those of me who could accept the gift of life without questioning it would survive to find the answer . I wrote in these pages that if there were an infinite num- - 143 ber of variations of myself , then what meaning could any one of us have ? I wondered about that then . I know the answer now . I know my answer . I am the baseline . I am the Danny from which all other Dannys will spring . I am a circle , complete unto itself . I have brought life into this world , and that life is me . And from this circle will spring an infinite number of tangents . All the other Dannys who have ever been and ever will be . Who the others are , what they are — that is for each of them to decide . But as for me , I know who I am . I am the center of it all . I am the end . I am the beginning . * * So , before it is over , I will have done it all and been it all . I will take the body back to the summer of 1975 and lay it gently in my bed , to be discovered in the morning by the maid . I will take his timebelt and put it in a box , wrap it up for my nephew and take it back a month to give it to my lawyer , Biggs - or - Briggs - or - whatever - his - name - is . I will leave Danny the legacy of ... our life . Later I will go back in time and visit him again . This time , though , I will handle the situation properly . It 's not enough to just give him the timebelt after my death ; I must visit him early in 1975 and explain to him how to use it wisely . Especially in the case of Diane . I 've already spoken to the nineteen - year - old Danny once , 144 The Man Who Folded Himself but I felt I mishandled it , so I went back and talked myself out of it . Later I will try again . Perhaps a little earlier . May of 1975 . Or April . ( I must be careful though . Each time I change my mind about how to tell Danny , I have to go back earlier and earlier . That way I excise the later tracks , the incorrect ones . But I must be careful not to go back too early - I must give him a chance to mature . I think of the old Dan who went chasing after the young Diane . I must be careful , careful . ) Perhaps I should just leave him this manuscript instead . These pages will tell the story better than I can . Maybe that would be the best way . a * * * There is just one last thing .. What is it like to die ? There is no Don to come back and tell me . And I 'm scared . It 's the one thing I will have to face alone . Totally alone . There will be absolutely no foreknowledge . Nor will there be any hindknowledge . The terrible thing about death is that you do n't know you 've died . -Or is that the terrible thing ? Maybe that 's the blessing . It 's the jump - shock that will kill me . I know that . I will tap my belt twice — and I will cease to exist . Cease to exist . Cease to exist . The words echo in my head . Cease to exist . Until they have lost all meaning . I try to imagine what it will be like . 145 No more me . The end of Danny . The end . I am afraid of it more than anything else in my life . Absence of -me . * * * Dear Danny , Time travel is not immortality . It will allow you to experience all the possible variations of your life . But it is not an unlimited ticket . There will be an end . My body has not experienced its years in sequence . But it has experienced years . And it has aged . And my mind has been carried headlong with it — this lump of flesh travels through time its own way , in a way that no man has the power to change . I 've had to learn to accept that , Danny , in order to find peace within my mind . My mind ? Perhaps I 'm not a mind at all . Perhaps I 'm only a body pretending the vanity of being something more . Perhaps it 's only the fact that language , which allows me to manipulate symbols , ideas , and concepts , also provides the awareness of self that precedes the inevitable analysis . Hmm . I have spent a lifetime analyzing my life . Living it . And rewriting it to suit me . I once compared time travel to a subjective work of art . 146 The Man Who Folded Himself That was truer than I realized . I am the artist of time . I am the hero of my own life . And I can choose the scenes I wish to play . Even the last one . And that scares me too . Just a little . I do n't know when that body was coming from . It - he tapped the belt and came back to August 23 . Thinking he was going to witness the arrival of himself . Thinking he was going to witness his death . InsteadI do n't know when that body came from . I do n't know when it 's starting point is / was / will be . I do n't know when I 'm going to die . But I do know it will be soon . I admit it . I 'm scared . But perhaps it will be a gentle way to go . I will never know what happened . I will never really know when . And I will die much as I lived - in the act of jumping across time . It will be a fitting way to go . Danny , you can not avoid mortality . But you can choose your way of meeting it . And that is the most that any man can hope for . Live well , my son . * * * Maybe this will be the last page . I think I should add something to "

Now that I know the directions in which I will go - no , can go — the decisions are mine . 147 I need do none of the things that Uncle Jim has described . ( In fact , some of them shock me beyond words . ) Or I could do all of them , I may change as I grow older . The point is , I know what I am beginning if I put on this belt . I feel a wonderful empathy for that beautiful old man . And a terrible sadness at his loss . I wish he were here now . I wish there were some way to thank him , to touch him . But I 'm pretty sure the mere expression of the thought may be enough . He knows . I know he knows . I attended his funeral this morning . I ca n't believe he 's dead . He is n't , of course . Not to me . I know where to go looking for him . Should I ? The decisions are mine . A whole world waits for me . The future beckons . Where to begin ?
