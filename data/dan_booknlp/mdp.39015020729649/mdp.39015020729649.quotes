417	423	425	426	Myron Bronowski	109	" Do n't be dramatic , "
430	442	443	443	He	91	" You did n't expect to . You told me that . "
478	524	468	468	He	91	" That does n't make it pleasant . But you 're right , it does n't matter . There are other things I can do and intend to do and , besides that , I depend on you . If you could only find out — "
525	555	425	426	Myron Bronowski	109	" Do n't finish , Pete . I 've heard it all before . All I have to do is decipher the thinking of a non - human intelligence . "
556	579	468	468	He	91	" A beffer - than - human intelligence . Those creatures from the para - Universe are trying to make themselves understood . "
580	585	587	587	Bronowski	109	" That may be , "
589	659	587	587	Bronowski	109	" but they 're trying to do it through my intelligence , which is better than human I sometimes think , but not much . Sometimes , in the dark of the night , I lie awake and wonder if different intelligences can communicate at all ; or , if I 've had a particularly bad day , whether the phrase ' different intelligences ' has meaning at all . "
660	664	666	666	Lamont	91	" It does , "
681	755	756	756	Bronowski	109	" It means Hallam and me . It means that fool - hero , Dr. Frederick Hallam and me . We 're different intelligences because when I talk to him he does n't understand . His idiot face gets redder and his eyes bulge and his ears * 3 block . I 'd say his mind stops functioning , but I lack the proof of any other state from which it might stop . "
759	773	756	756	Bronowski	109	" What a way to speak of the Father of the Electron Pump . "
774	806	821	821	Bronowski	109	" That 's it . Reputed Father of the Electron Pump . A bastard birth , if ever there was one . His contribution was least in substance . I know . "
807	819	821	821	Bronowski	109	" I know , too . You 've told me often , "

1282	1294	1295	1295	he	94	" Why the devil should I be interested in your tungsten ? "
1298	1348	1295	1295	he	94	" Why should anyone ? If you 'll look at the bottle , you 'll see that the thing has n't been opened for twenty years ; and if you had n't put your own grubby paws on it , you would have seen no one had touched it . "
1362	1378	1357	1357	He	92	" Listen , Denison , someone has changed the contents . Thafs not the tungsten . "
1389	1395	1357	1357	He	92	" How would you know ? "
1472	1478	1470	1470	Denison	94	" How would you know ? "
1487	1490	1470	1470	Denison	94	" you , "
1671	1677	1684	1684	Hallam	92	" How would you know ? "
1690	1699	1684	1684	Hallam	92	" I 'll show you that I know . "
1910	1918	1904	1906	The mass spectrographer	246	" Well , it is n't tungsten . "
1931	1951	1904	1906	The mass spectrographer	246	" All right . We 'll tell that to Bright - boy Denison . I want a report and — "
1953	1981	1904	1906	The mass spectrographer	246	" But wait awhile , Dr. Hallam . I 'm telling you it 's not tungsten , but that does n't mean I know what it is . "
1982	1995	1904	1906	The mass spectrographer	246	" What do you mean you do n't know what it is . "
1996	2004	2005	2006	The technician	247	" I mean the results are ridiculous . "
2011	2025	2005	2006	The technician	247	" Impossible , actually . The charge - mass ratio is all wrong . "
2026	2033	1904	1906	The mass spectrographer	246	" All wrong in what way ? "
2034	2044	1904	1906	The mass spectrographer	246	" Too high . It just ca n't be . "
2045	2050	2052	2052	Hallam	92	" Well , then , "
2088	2116	2064	2064	his	92	" get the frequency of its characteristic x - radiation and figure out the charge . Do n't just sit around and talk about something being impossible . "
2151	2156	2157	2157	He	92	" Did you find — "
2182	2190	2164	2164	his	92	" Did you find the nuclear charge ? "
2191	2199	2164	2164	his	92	" Yes , but it 's wrong . "
2200	2210	2164	2164	his	92	" All right , Tracy . Do it over . "
2211	2224	2164	2164	his	92	" I did it over a dozen times . It 's wrong . "
2225	2243	2164	2164	his	92	" If you made a measurement , that 's it . Do n't argue with the facts . "
2251	2276	2244	2244	Tracy	96	" I 've got to , Doc . If I take the measurements seriously , then what you 've given me is plutonium- 186 . "
2277	2282	2164	2164	his	92	" Plutonium-186 ? PZutoraum-186 ? "
2283	2293	2164	2164	his	92	" The charge is +94- The mass is 186 . "
2294	2311	2164	2164	his	92	" But that 's impossible . There 's no such isotope . There ca n't be . "
2312	2328	2164	2164	his	92	" That 's what I 'm saying to you . But those are the measurements . "
2329	2383	2164	2164	his	92	" But a situation like that leaves the nucleus over fifty neutrons short . You ca n't have plutonium-186 . You could n't squeeze l7 ninety - four protons into one nucleus with only ninety - two neutrons and expect it to hang together for even a trillion - trillionth of a second . "
2384	2395	2397	2397	Tracy	96	" That 's what I 'm telling you , Doc , "
2451	2459	2461	2461	Hallam	92	" Are there any signs of radioactivity ? "
2473	2479	2481	2482	the technician	247	" I thought of that , "
2484	2492	2481	2482	the technician	247	" It 's stable . Absolutely stable . "
2493	2501	2481	2482	the technician	247	" Then it ca n't be plutonium-186 . "
2502	2510	2511	2511	Hallam	92	" I keep telling you , Doc . "
2516	2524	2511	2511	Hallam	92	" Well , give me the stuff . "
2686	2698	2683	2683	he	92	" It is n't tungsten , just as I told you . "
2704	2714	2700	2700	Denison	95	" Oh , and what is it , then ? "
2788	2803	2770	2770	he	92	" Hey , did n't you tell me that stuff was non - radioactive ? "
2804	2808	2810	2810	Tracy	96	" What stuff ? "
2817	2824	2826	2826	Hallam	92	" That stuff you called plutonium-186 , "
2828	2836	2826	2826	Hallam	92	" Oh . Well it was stable . "
2837	2860	2861	2861	Tracy	96	" About as stable as your mental state . If you call this nonradioactive , you belong in a plumber 's shop . "
2864	2877	2880	2880	he	92	" Okay , Doc . Pass it over and let 's try . "
2883	2909	2880	2880	he	92	" Beats me ! It is radioactive . Not much , but it is . I do n't see how I could have missed that . "
2910	2922	2880	2880	he	92	" And how far can I trust your crap about plutonium-186 ? "
3077	3088	3064	3064	he	92	" Have you been handling this thing with your hands ? "
3089	3093	3095	3095	Hallam	92	" Not much , "
3097	3118	3095	3095	Hallam	92	" Well , do n't . If you 've got any more , do n't . It 's emitting positrons . "
3119	3122	3064	3064	he	92	" Oh ? "
3123	3146	3064	3064	he	92	" The most energetic positrons I 've ever seen . . . . And your figures on its radioactivity are too low . "
3147	3151	3095	3095	Hallam	92	" Too low ? "
3152	3175	3064	3064	he	92	" Distinctly . And what bothers me is that every measurement I take is just a trifle higher than the one before . "
3199	3216	3182	3182	Bronowski	109	" Okay , you 've seen Hallam and been kicked out as expected . What next ? "
3217	3298	3299	3299	Lamont	91	" I have n't quite decided . But whatever it is , it 's going to dump him on his fat behind . I saw him once before , you know ; years ago , when I first came here ; when I thought he was a great man . A great man — He 's the greatest villain in the history of science . He 's rewritten the history of the Pump , you know , rewritten it here — "
3304	3338	3299	3299	Lamont	91	" He believes his own fantasy and fights for it with a diseased fury . He 's a pygmy with only one talent , the ability to convince others he 's a giant . "
3360	3383	3343	3343	Bronowski	109	" Oh , well , that does n't do any good , and I 've told it all to you before anyway . "
3384	3388	3390	3390	Bronowski	109	" Many times , "
3392	3404	3390	3390	Bronowski	109	" But it just gravels me to have the whole world — "
4000	4046	3978	3978	McFarland	99	" I do n't choose to remember , because it does n't matter ; it really does n't . Suppose I laid claim to having said something . No one would believe it . I would look like an idiot , and a megalomaniac one . "
4047	4059	3978	3978	McFarland	99	" And Hallam would see to it that you were retired ? "
4060	4087	3978	3978	McFarland	99	" I 'm not saying that , but I do n't see that it would do me any good . What 's the difference , anyway ? "
4088	4095	4097	4097	Lamont	91	" A matter of historical truth ! "
4099	4199	4097	4097	Lamont	91	" Oh , bull . The historical truth is that Hallam never let go . He drove everyone into investigating , whether they wanted to or not . Without him , that tungsten would eventually have exploded with I do n't know how many casualties . There might never have been another sample , and we might never have had the Pump . Hallam deserves the credit for it , even if he does n't deserve the credit , and if that does n't make sense , I ca n't help it , because history does n't make sense . "
4243	4247	3978	3978	McFarland	99	" Hallam 's tungsten "
4352	4380	4349	4349	Kantrowitsch	98	" We 'd better spread it out . If we keep it in sizable lumps it will vaporize or explode or both and contaminate half the city . "
4677	4694	4695	4695	He	99	" You know , what we need is a little bit of fantasy here . Suppose — "
4892	4898	4899	4899	Lamont	91	" little bit of fantasy . "
4960	5131	4951	4951	Hallam	92	" Gentlemen , we are getting nowhere . I am therefore going to make a suggestion , not because it necessarily makes sense , but because it represents less nonsense than anything else I 've heard . . . . We are faced with a substance , plutonium-186 , that can not exist at all , let alone as an even momentarily stable substance , if the natural laws of the Universe have any validity at all . It follows , then , that since it does indubitably exist and did exist as a stable substance to begin with , it must have existed , at least to begin with , in a place or at a time or under circumstances where the natural laws of the Universe were other than they are . To put it bluntly , the substance we are studying did not originate in our Universe at all , but in another — an alternate Universe — a parallel Universe . Call it what you want . "
5203	5317	5318	5319	The audience	283	" I point out that at the same time that the plutonium-186 appeared , a sample of tungsten , made up of several stable isotopes , including tungsten-186 , disappeared . It may have slipped over into the parallel Universe . After all , it is logical to suppose that it is simpler for an exchange of mass to take place than for a one - way transfer to do so . In the parallel Universe , tungsten-186 may be as anomalous as plutonium-186 is here . It may begin as a stable substance and slowly become increasingly radioactive . It may serve as an energy source there just as plutonium-186 would here . "
5413	5418	5367	5368	the audience	283	" para - Universe , "
5425	5430	5367	5368	the audience	283	" parallel - Universe , "
5470	5531	5453	5453	Hallam	92	Insight—"Yes , I think so , and I think that the energy source can not be made practical unless Universe and para - Universe work together , each at one half of a pump , pushing energy from them to us and from us to them , taking advantage of the difference in the natural laws of the two Universes . "
5537	5541	5453	5453	Hallam	92	" para - Universe "
5563	5565	5553	5553	he	92	" pump "
5835	5840	5827	5828	the public	290	" Hallam's - tungsten . "
5920	6005	5917	5917	he	92	" We can not say in how many different ways the laws of the para - Universe differ from our own , but we can guess with some assurance that the strong nuclear interaction , which is the strongest known force in our Universe is even 26 stronger in the para - Universe ; perhaps a hundred times stronger . This means that protons are more easily held together against their own electrostatic attraction and that a nucleus requires fewer neutrons to produce stability . "
6147	6237	6244	6244	its	307	" Meanwhile , the tungsten-186 that enters the para - Universe is unstable there for the opposite reason . By the laws of the paraUniverse it has too many neutrons , or too few protons . The tungsten-186 nuclei begin to emit electrons , releasing energy steadily while doing so , and with each emitted electron a neutron changes to a proton until , in the end , it is plutonium-186 again . With each tungsten-186 nucleus sent into the paraUniverse , twenty more electrons are added to it . "
6306	6519	6520	6520	You	309	" The conversion of this notion into reality and the actual establishment of the Electron Pump as an effective energy source proceeded with amazing speed , and every stage of its success enhanced Hallam 's prestige . 27 3 Lamont had no reason to doubt the basis of that prestige and it was with a certain hero - worshipfulness ( the memory of which embarrassed him later and which he strove — with some success — to eliminate from his mind ) that he first applied for a chance to interview Hallam at some length in connection with the history he was planning . Hallam seemed amenable . In thirty years , his position in public esteem had become so lofty one might wonder why his nose did not bleed . Physically , he had aged impressively , if not gracefully . There was a ponderousness to his body that gave him the appearance of circumstantial weightiness and if his face were gross in its features he seemed able to give them the air of a kind of intellectual repose . He still reddened quickly and the easily bruised nature of his self - esteem was a byword . Hallam had undergone some quick briefing before Lamont 's entrance . He said , "
6555	6556	6559	6559	sir	310	" "
6561	6562	6559	6559	sir	310	" "
6591	6597	6581	6581	you	309	" and he chuckled here , "
6633	6754	6755	6755	I	0	" Lamont accepted this , at the time , as a straightforward statement , and , indeed , the speech may not have been as obscenely condescending as he later insisted on remembering it to have been . It was typical , though , as Lamont later found out , or at least maintained , of Hallam 's method of grasping the essentials of the work done by others . He could talk briskly about the subject 28 thereafter without being overparticular , or particular at all , in assigning credit . But the younger Lamont of the time was rather flattered , and he began at once with that voluble eagerness one experiences in explaining one 's own discoveries . "
6835	6836	6848	6848	sir	310	" "
6841	6845	6848	6848	sir	310	" said Hallam . "
6993	6994	6987	6987	they	319	" "
7001	7002	6987	6987	they	319	" "
7026	7027	6987	6987	they	319	" "
7042	7043	7048	7048	sir	310	" "
7104	7105	7106	7106	I	0	" "
7119	7137	7114	7114	you	310	" Hallam was smiling . It was the last time he ever smiled in Lamont 's presence . "
7158	7162	7147	7150	Profes- 29 sor Hallam	92	" began Lamont . "
7168	7169	7147	7150	Profes- 29 sor Hallam	92	" "
7178	7185	7147	7150	Profes- 29 sor Hallam	92	" corrected Hallam , still smiling . "
7191	7199	7200	7200	I	0	" said Lamont , clearing his throat . "
7227	7228	7147	7150	Profes- 29 sor Hallam	92	" "
7233	7243	7147	7150	Profes- 29 sor Hallam	92	" said Hallam , with a touch of complacence . "
7310	7329	7330	7330	I	0	" Lamont shook his head with a little annoyance . He found the remark irrelevant . He said , "
7411	7430	7407	7407	they	327	" Hallam 's smile had now disappeared , and permanently . He was frowning and he said loudly , "
7441	7442	7462	7462	they	327	" "
7477	7491	7462	7462	they	327	" Hallam 's chair shoved back with an angry scrape . He said , "
7511	7512	7521	7521	they	327	" "
7523	7524	7526	7526	they	327	" "
7529	7558	7526	7526	they	327	" Lamont became aware now of the storm of emotion he had raised , but he could n't understand its cause . Uncertainly , he 3 ° said , "
7583	7597	7581	7581	sir	310	" Hallam , red - faced , had heaved himself to his feet . "
7603	7607	7581	7581	sir	310	" he shouted . "
7628	7647	7625	7626	young man	329	" he advanced on the still seated and thoroughly astonished Lamont and shook a thick finger at him , "
7713	7875	7876	7878	That damned fool	336	" Lamont could only leave , a puzzled man , utterly upset at having created harsh feeling where he had wanted only to have good will . And then he found that his historical sources were suddenly drying up . Those who had been loquacious enough a week earlier now remembered nothing and had no time for further interviews . Lamont was irritated at first and then a slow anger began to build within him . He looked at what he had from a new viewpoint , and now he began to squeeze and insist where earlier he had merely asked . When he met Hallam at department functions , Hallam frowned and looked through him and Lamont began to look scornful in his turn . The net result was that Lamont found his prime career as para - theoretician beginning to abort and turned more firmly than ever toward his secondary career as science - historian . 6 ( continued ) "
7880	7886	7876	7878	That damned fool	336	" muttered Lamont , reminiscently . "
7957	7958	7959	7959	I	0	" "
7962	7968	7959	7959	I	0	" said Bronowski , indifferently , "
7978	7979	7975	7976	no angel	340	" "
7994	7995	7975	7976	no angel	340	" "
8024	8028	8016	8018	Maybe six others	343	" Lamont remembered . "
8033	9013	9014	9015	Dr. Bronowski	109	" he said . 4 Bronowski 's placid exterior never fooled anyone who grew to know him even moderately well . He was sharp and he worried a problem till he had the solution or till he had it in such tatters that he knew no solution was possible . Consider the Etruscan inscriptions on which he had built his reputation . The language had been a living one till the first century a.d . , but the cultural imperialism of the Romans had left nothing behind and it had vanished almost completely . What inscriptions survived the carnage of Roman hostility and — worse — indifference were written in Greek letters so that they could be pronounced , but nothing more . Etruscan seemed to have no relationship to any of the surrounding languages ; it seemed very archaic ; it seemed not even to be Indo - European . Bronowski therefore passed on to another language that seemed to have no relationship to any of the surrounding languages ; that seemed very archaic ; that seemed not even to be IndoEuropean — but which was very much alive and which was spoken in a region not so very far from where once the Etruscans had lived . What of the Basque language ? Bronowski wondered . And he 3a used Basque as his guide . Others had tried this before him and given up . Bronowski did not . It was hard work , for Basque , an extraordinarily difficult language in itself , was only the loosest of helps . Bronowski found more and more reason , as he went on , to suspect some cultural connection between the inhabitants of early northern Italy and early northern Spain . He could even make out a strong case for a broad swatch of pre - Celts filling western Europe with a language of which Etruscan and Basque were dimly - related survivors . In two thousand years , however , Basque had evolved and had become more than a little contaminated with Spanish . To try , first , to reason out its structure in Roman times and then relate it to Etruscan was an intellectual feat of surpassing difficulty and Bronowski utterly astonished the world 's philologists when he triumphed . The Etruscan translations themselves were marvels of dullness and had no significance whatever ; routine funerary inscriptions for the most part . The fact of the translation , however , was stunning and , as it turned out , it proved of the greatest importance to Lamont . — Not at first . To be perfectly truthful about it , the translations had been a fact for nearly five years before Lamont had as much as heard that there were such people , once , as the Etruscans . But then Bronowski came to the university to give one of the annual Fellowship Lectures and Lamont , who usually shirked the duty of attending which fell on the faculty members , did not shirk this one . It was not because he recognized its importance or felt any interest in it whatever . It was because he was dating a graduate student in the Department of Romance Languages and it was either that or a music festival he particularly wanted to avoid hearing . The social connection was a feeble one , scarcely satisfactory from Lamont 's point of view and only temporary , but it did get him to the talk . He rather enjoyed it , as it happened . The dim Etruscan civilization entered his consciousness for the first time as a matter of 33 distant interest , and the problem of solving an undeciphered language struck him as fascinating . When young , he had enjoyed solving cryptograms , but had put them away with other childish things in favor of the much grander cryptograms posed by nature , so that he ended in para - theory . Yet Bronowski 's talk took him back to the youthful joys of making slow sense of what seemed a random collection of symbols , and combined it with sufficient difficulty to add great honor to the task . Bronowski was a cryptogrammist on the grandest scale , and it was the description of the steady encroachment of reason upon the unknown that Lamont enjoyed . All would yet have gone for nothing — the triple coincidence of Bronowski 's appearance at campus , Lamont 's youthful cryptogrammic enthusiasm , the social pressure of an attractive young lady — were it not for the fact that it was the next day that Lamont saw Hallam and placed himself firmly and , as he eventually found , permanently , in the doghouse . Within an hour of the conclusion of that interview , Lamont determined to see Bronowski . The issue at hand was the very one that had seemed so obvious to himself and that had so offended Hallam . Because it brought down censure on him , Lamont felt bound to strike back — and in connection with the point of censure specifically . The para - men were more intelligent than man . Lamont had believed it before in a casual sort of way as something more obvious than vital . Now it had become vital . It must be proved and the fact of it forced down the throat of Hallam ; sideways , if possible , and with all the sharp corners exposed . Already Lamont found himself so far removed from his sorecent hero worship that he relished the prospect . Bronowski was still on campus and Lamont tracked him down and insisted on seeing him . Bronowski was blandly courteous when finally cornered . Lamont acknowledged the courtesies brusquely , introduced himself with clear impatience , and said , "
9042	9046	9032	9032	I	0	" Bronowski said , "
9064	9065	9067	9067	you	109	" "

9133	9144	9102	9103	Dr. Bronowski	109	" ( He was five years older than Lamont . ) "

9319	9320	9307	9307	You	109	" "
9335	9342	9343	9343	You	109	" Lamont stared at him suspiciously , "
9350	9356	9357	9357	You	109	" Bronowski shook his head . "
9483	9500	9501	9501	You	109	" Lamont had kept himself from interrupting only with difficulty , and now he burst out , "
9587	9588	9583	9583	you	109	" "
9603	9643	9583	9583	you	109	" Bronowski did not seem impressed . He took out a package of dried figs from his pocket , opened them and began to eat . He offered it to Lamont , who shook his head . Lamont said , "
9687	9695	9666	9666	They	354	" He interrupted himself here to ask , "
9708	9709	9697	9697	you	109	" "
9713	9717	9697	9697	you	109	" said Bronowski . "
9732	9737	9741	9741	They	354	" Lamont hastened on . "
9847	9851	9852	9852	I	0	" Bronowski said , "

9948	9986	9947	9948	See here"--Bronowski	111	here"--Bronowski rose to take off his jacket and then sat down in a half - reclining position , the soft rotundity of his body seeming to relax and crease in great comfort as though physical ease helped him think—"about
10122	10130	10131	10131	I	0	" Lamont listened gravely , and said , "
10184	10185	10188	10188	you	109	" "
10195	10196	10188	10188	you	109	" "
10286	10315	10319	10319	they	113	" He paused for breath , feeling himself to be too excited , too eager . He must n't oversell his case . 37 Bronowski regarded him curiously . "
10333	10334	10326	10326	you	368	" "
10456	10457	10463	10463	their	113	" "
10466	10472	10463	10463	their	113	" said Bronowski , unimpressed . "
10504	10508	10473	10473	You	368	" Bronowski said , "
10575	10581	10615	10615	they	113	" Lamont said , intensely , "
10610	10611	10615	10615	they	113	" "
10619	10620	10615	10615	they	113	" "
10670	10683	10727	10727	They	113	" ( and Lamont strove to keep venom out of his voice ) "
10699	10700	10702	10702	they	113	" "
10724	10726	10727	10727	They	113	" 38 "
10772	10773	10803	10803	they	113	" "
10792	10793	10777	10777	they	113	" "
10910	10911	10913	10913	their	113	" "
10916	10920	10913	10913	their	113	" said Bronowski , "
10927	10928	10913	10913	their	113	" "
10931	10937	10913	10913	their	113	" Bronowski shook his head . "
10953	10962	10968	10968	you	0	" Lamont looked at him with flaring anger . "
11070	11071	11100	11100	you	0	" "
11077	11078	11100	11100	you	0	" "
11124	11125	11122	11122	myself	0	" "
11133	11134	11127	11127	you	0	" "
11252	11256	11258	11258	I	0	" Lamont shrugged . "
11278	11310	11311	11311	I	0	" He rose to go . Both men were angry and bore themselves with that stiff - legged courtesy one assumes when addressing someone who is hostile , but still mannerly . "
11314	11318	11319	11319	you	0	" said Lamont , "
11329	11338	11319	11319	you	0	" Bronowski was on his feet , too . "
11346	11410	11341	11341	you	0	" he said coldly , and the two shook hands briefly . Lamont did not expect to hear from Bronowski again . He then began the process of talking himself into believing it would be better to handle the translation effort on his own . Two days later , however , Bronowski was at Lamont 's laboratory . He said , rather brusquely , "
11454	11566	11451	11451	you	0	" Lamont had barely time for a surprised expression of thanks when Bronowski stalked off , apparently angrier at having given in , than at having resisted . They became friends in time ; and , in time , Lamont learned what had brought Bronowski around . The day after their discussion , Bronowski had had lunch at the Faculty Club with a group of the higher officials of the university , including , of course , the president . Bronowski had announced that he would accept the position and send in a formal letter to that effect in due time and all had expressed gratification . The president had said , "
11593	11697	11724	11724	God	116	" The malapropism had gone uncorrected , of course , and Bro- 40 nowski 's smile , though strained , did not actually waver . Afterward , the head of the Department of Ancient History explained the president to be more of a Minnesotan than a classical scholar and since Lake Itasca was the point of origin of the mighty Mississippi , the slip of the tongue was a natural one . But , in combination with Lamont 's sneer at the extent of his fame , Bronowski found the expression rankling . When Lamont finally heard the story , he was amused . "
11703	11707	11708	11708	I	0	" he said . "
11742	11743	11717	11717	You	0	" "
11749	11780	11717	11717	You	0	" said Bronowski . 5 A year 's work , however , had netted them very little . Messages had finally come across ; messages had come back . Nothing . "
11784	11792	11717	11717	You	0	" Lamont had said feverishly to Bronowski . "
11805	11806	11846	11846	God	116	" "
11843	11844	11834	11834	you	91	" "
11857	11858	11850	11850	We	395	" "
11960	11961	11953	11953	you	91	" "
11969	11974	11963	11963	I	0	" said Lamont abruptly . "
11984	11985	11976	11976	I	0	" "
11988	11994	11963	11963	I	0	" said Bronowski , dryly , "
12024	12025	12011	12012	Your doctor	398	" "
12030	12034	12011	12012	Your doctor	398	" groaned Lamont . "
12039	12040	12011	12012	Your doctor	398	" "
12044	12326	12011	12012	Your doctor	398	" said Lamont , and he walked away hurriedly . When he had first tried to get Bronowski to join forces with him , Lamont 's grievance had concerned only Hallam 's meanminded obstinacy concerning the suggestion that the para - men were the more intelligent . It was in that respect and that respect only that Lamont was striving for a breakthrough . He intended nothing beyond that — at first . But in the course of the following months , he had been subjected to endless exasperation . His requests for equipment , for technical assistance , for computer time were delayed ; his request for travel funds snubbed ; his views at interdepartmental meetings invariably overlooked . The breaking point came when Henry Garrison , junior to himself in point of service and definitely so in point of ability , received an advisory appointment , rich in prestige , that , by all rights , should have gone to Lamont . It was then that Lamont 's resentment built up to the point where merely proving himself right was no longer sufficient . He yearned to smash Hallam , destroy him utterly . The feeling was reinforced every day , almost every hour , by the unmistakable attitude of everyone else at the Pump Station . Lamont 's abrasive personality did n't collect sympathy , but some existed nevertheless . Garrison himself was embarrassed . He was a quiet - spoken , amiable young man who clearly wanted no trouble and who now stood in the doorway of Lamont 's lab with an expression that had more than a small component of apprehension in it . He said , "
12340	12341	12329	12329	Pete	91	" "
12348	12371	12372	12372	Pete	91	" said Lamont , frowning and avoiding a direct eye - to - eye glance . Garrison came in and sat down . "
12374	12378	12372	12372	Pete	91	" he said , "
12407	12408	12389	12389	I	0	" "
12425	12426	12427	12427	Pete	91	" "
12458	12465	12451	12451	you	91	" Lamont rounded on the other . "
12484	12500	12478	12478	he	92	" Garrison was caught by surprise . He pursed his lips and rubbed his nose . "
12503	12514	12515	12516	Great man	401	" he said , and let the sound fade off . "
12524	12525	12521	12522	Inspiring leader	403	" "
12528	12529	12521	12522	Inspiring leader	403	" "
12582	12592	12577	12577	he	404	" Garrison gave out a small , uneasy laugh , "
12603	12604	12593	12593	You	91	" "
12616	12622	12607	12607	I	0	" said Lamont , morosely . "
12651	12652	12645	12645	I	0	" "
12706	12707	12709	12709	he	404	" "
12734	12735	12727	12727	I	0	" "
12738	12739	12740	12740	My	0	" "
12743	12760	12740	12740	My	0	" muttered Lamont , who at the moment had not the slightest idea as to how . "
12766	12770	12771	12771	You	91	" said Garrison . "
12884	12885	12886	12886	I	0	" "
12893	12901	12886	12886	I	0	" said Lamont , in sudden fury . "
12909	12967	12905	12905	your	91	" Garrison rose suddenly and left without a word . Lamont had made another enemy ; or , at least , lost another friend . The price , however , was right , he finally decided , for one remark of Garrison had set the ball rolling in another direction . Garrison had said , in essence , "
12992	13072	12986	12986	Hallam	92	" With that clanging in his mind , Lamont for the first time turned his attention away from Hallam and placed it on the Electron Pump . Was the Electron Pump the key to human paradise ? Or was there , by Heaven , a catch ? Everything in history had had a catch . What was the catch to the Electron Pump ? Lamont knew enough of the history of para - theory to know that the matter of "
13075	13121	12986	12986	Hallam	92	" had not gone unexplored . When it was first announced that the basic over - all change in the Electron Pump was the Pumping of electrons from the Universe to the para - Universe , there had not been wanting those who said immediately , "
13134	13757	12986	12986	Hallam	92	" This was easily answered . At the largest reasonable rate of Pumping , the electron supply would last for at least a trillion trillion trillion years — and the entire Universe , together , presumably , with the para - Universe , would n't last a tiny fraction of that time . The next objection was more sophisticated . There was no possibility of Pumping all the electrons across . As the electrons were Pumped , the para - Universe would gain a net negative charge , and the Universe a net positive charge . With each year , as this difference in charge grew , it would become more difficult to Pump further electrons against the force of the opposed 44 charge - difference . It was , of course , neutral atoms that were actually Pumped but the distortion of the orbital electrons in the process created an effective charge which increased immensely with the radioactive changes that followed . If the charge - concentration remained at the points of Pumping , the effect on the orbit - distorted atoms being Pumped would stop the entire process almost at once , but of course , there was diffusion to take into account . The charge - concentration diffused outward over the Earth , and the effect on the Pumping process had been calculated with that in mind . The increased positive charge of the Earth generally forced the positively charged Solar wind to avoid the planet at a greater distance , and the magnetosphere was enlarged . Thanks to the work of McFarland ( the real originator of the Great Insight according to Lamont ) it could be shown that a definite equilibrium point was reached as the Solar wind swept away more and more of the accumulating positive particles that were repelled from Earth 's surface and driven higher into the exosphere . With each increase in Pumping intensity ; with each additional Pumping Station constructed , the net positive charge on Earth increased slightly , and the magnetosphere expanded by a few miles . The change , however , was minor , and the positive charge was , in the end , swept away by the Solar wind and spread through the outer reaches of the Solar system . Even so — even allowing for the most rapid possible diffusion of the charge , the time would still come when the local chargedifference between Universe and para - Universe at the points of Pumping would grow large enough to end the process , and that would be a small fraction of the time it would take really to use up all the electrons ; roughly , a trillion - trillionth of the time . But that still meant that Pumping would remain possible for a trillion years . Only a single trillion years , but that was enough ; it would suffice . A trillion years was far longer than man would last , or the Solar system either . And if man somehow did last that long ( or some creature that was man 's successor and sup- 45 planter ) then no doubt something would be devised to correct the situation . A great deal could be done in a trillion years . Lamont had to agree to that . But then he thought of something else , another line of thought that he well remembered Hallam himself had dealt with in one of the articles he had written for popular consumption . With some distaste , he dug out the article . It was important to see what Hallam had said before he carried the matter further . The article said , in part , "
13835	13947	13977	13977	It	416	" There can then be no further work possible till the water has been returned uphill — and that takes work . It fact , it takes more work to force the water uphill than we can collect by then allowing it to flow downhill . We work at an energy - loss . Fortunately , the Sun does the work for us . It evaporates the oceans so that water vapor climbs high in the atmosphere , forms clouds , and eventually falls again as rain or snow . This soaks the ground at all levels , fills the springs and streams , and keeps the water forever running downhill . "
14014	14102	13977	13977	It	416	" All sources of energy in our Universe run down . We ca n't help that . Everything is downhill in just one direction , and we can force a temporary uphill , backward , only by taking advantage of some greater downhill in the vicinity . If we want useful energy forever , we need a road that is downhill both ways . That is a paradox in our Universe ; it stands to reason that whatever is downhill one way is uphill going back . 46 "
14201	14220	14221	14221	Lamont	91	" The Electron Pump takes advantage of a road that is downhill both ways . The Electron Pump — "
14234	14243	14244	14244	He	91	" The Road that is Downhill Both Ways . "
14380	14389	14377	14377	he	91	" I 'm going to see Hallam again . "
14395	14399	14377	14377	he	91	" What for ? "
14400	14408	14377	14377	he	91	" To have him turn me down . "
14409	14431	14377	14377	he	91	" Yes , that 's about your speed , Pete . You 're unhappy if your troubles die down a bit . "
14432	14471	14377	14377	he	91	" You do n't understand . It 's important to have him refuse to listen to me . I ca n't have it said afterward that I by - passed him ; that he was ignorant of it . "
14472	14499	14377	14377	he	91	" Of what ? Of the translation of the para - symbols ? There is n't any yet . Do n't jump the gun , Pete . "
14500	14508	14510	14510	he	91	" No , no , not that , "
14581	14591	14577	14577	Hallam	92	" What 's this crisis you 're talking about ? "
14592	14600	14602	14602	Lamont	91	" Something 's turned up , sir , "
14606	14614	14602	14602	Lamont	91	" inspired by one of your articles . "
14615	14618	14577	14577	Hallam	92	" Oh ? "
14623	14627	14577	14577	Hallam	92	" Which one ? "
14628	14651	14577	14577	Hallam	92	" ' The Road that is Downhill Both Ways . ' The one you programmed for Teen - age Life , sir . "
14652	14658	14577	14577	Hallam	92	" And what about it ? "
14659	14698	14699	14699	Hallam	92	" I believe the Electron Pump is not downhill both ways , if I may use your metaphor , which is not , as it happens , a completely accurate way of describing the Second Law of Thermodynamics . "
14702	14710	14699	14699	Hallam	92	" What have you got in mind ? "
14711	14752	14756	14756	Lamont	91	" I can explain it best , sir , by setting up the Field Equations for the two Universes , sir , and demonstrating an interaction that till now has not been considered — unfortunately so , in my opinion . "
14806	14862	14803	14803	Hallam	92	" See here , young man , I have no time now to engage in a full discussion of any aspect of para - theory . You send me a complete report and , for now , if you have some brief statement as to what you 're getting at , you may make it . "
14885	14996	14882	14882	He	91	" All right . The Second Law of Thermodynamics describes a process that inevitably chops off extremes . Water does n't run downhill ; what really happens is that extremes of gravitational potential are equalized . Water will just as easily bubble uphill if trapped underground . You can get work out of the juxtaposition of two 48 different temperature levels , but the end result is that the temperature is equalized at an intermediate level ; the hot body cools down and the cold body warms up . Both cooling and warming are equal aspects of the Second Law and , under , the proper circumstances , equally spontaneous . "
14997	15020	15021	15021	Lamont	91	" Do n't teach me elementary thermodynamics , young man . What is it you want ? I have very little time . "
15036	15154	15021	15021	Lamont	91	" Work is obtained out of the Electron Pump by an equalization of extremes . In this case , the extremes are the physical laws of the two Universes . The conditions that make those laws possible , whatever those conditions may be , are being bled from one Universe into the other and the end result of the entire process will be two Universes in which the laws of nature will be identical — and intermediate as compared with the situation now . Since this will produce uncertain but undoubtedly large changes in this Universe , it would seem that serious consideration must be given to stopping the Pumps and shutting down the whole operation permanently . "
15222	15226	15228	15228	Hallam	92	" You idiot , "
15236	15290	15228	15228	Hallam	92	" Do n't you suppose everyone at the station understands about the equalization of natural law . Are you wasting my time telling me something I knew when you were learning to read ? Get out of here , and any time you want to offer me your resignation , consider it accepted . "
15321	15324	15326	15326	Lamont	91	" Anyway , "
15328	15353	15326	15326	Lamont	91	" it clears the gound . I 've tried to tell him . He would n't listen . So I take the next step . "
15354	15360	15362	15362	Bronowski	109	" And what is that ? "
15364	15373	15362	15362	Bronowski	109	" I 'm going to see Senator Burt . "
15374	15388	15326	15326	Lamont	91	" You mean the head of the Committee on Technology and the Environment ? "
15389	15401	15326	15326	Lamont	91	" The same . You 've heard of him , then . "
15402	15447	15362	15362	Bronowski	109	" Who has n't . But where 's the point , Pete . What have you got that would interest him ? It 's not the translation . Pete , I 'm asking you once again . What have you got on your mind ? "
15448	15462	15326	15326	Lamont	91	" I ca n't explain . You do n't know para - theory . "
15463	15468	15326	15326	Lamont	91	" Does Senator Burt ? "
15469	15477	15480	15480	his	109	" More than you , I think . "
15483	15555	15480	15480	his	109	" Pete , let 's not kid around . Maybe I know things you do n't . We ca n't work together if we work against each other . Either I 'm a member of this little two - man corporation or I 'm not . You tell me what 's on your mind , and I 'll tell you something in exchange . Otherwise , let 's stop this altogether . "
15559	15698	15556	15556	Lamont	91	" All right . If you want it , I 'll give it to you . Now that I 've got it past Hallam , maybe it 's just as well . The point is that the Electron Pump is transferring natural law . In the para - Universe , the strong interaction is a hundred times stronger than it is here , which means that nuclear fission is much more likely here than there , and nuclear fusion is much more likely there than here . If the Electron Pump keeps on long enough , there will be a final equilibrium in which the strong nuclear interaction will be equally strong in both Universes , and be at a figure about ten times what it is here now and one - tenth what it is there now . "
15701	15708	15326	15326	Lamont	91	" Did n't anyone know this ? "
15709	15765	15326	15326	Lamont	91	" Oh , sure , everyone knew it . It was obvious almost from the start . Even Hallam can see it . That 's what got the bastard so excited . I started telling him this in detail as though I did n't think he had ever heard it before and he blew up . "
15766	15783	16005	16005	Bronowski	109	" But what 's the point then ? Is there danger in the interaction becoming intermediate . "
15784	15793	15326	15326	Lamont	91	" Of course . What do you think ? "
15794	15807	15326	15326	Lamont	91	" I do n't think anything . When will it become intermediate ? "
15808	15819	16005	16005	Bronowski	109	" At the present rate , io30 years or so . "
15820	15826	15326	15326	Lamont	91	" How long is that ? "
15827	15855	15326	15326	Lamont	91	" Long enough for a trillion trillion Universes like this one to be born , live , grow old , and die , one after the other . "
15856	15869	16005	16005	Bronowski	109	" Oh blazes , Pete . What odds does it make then ? "
15870	15877	15879	15879	Lamont	91	" Because to reach that figure , "
15885	15922	15879	15879	Lamont	91	" which is the official one , certain assumptions were made which I think were wrong . And if certain other assumptions are made , which I think are right , we 're in trouble now . "
15923	15929	16005	16005	Bronowski	109	" What kind of trouble ? "
15930	15954	15326	15326	Lamont	91	" Suppose the Earth turned into a whiff of gas in a period of about five minutes . Would you consider that trouble ? "
15955	15961	15879	15879	Lamont	91	" Because of the Pumping ? "
15962	15968	16005	16005	Bronowski	109	" Because of the Pumping ! "
15969	15989	15326	15326	Lamont	91	" And how about the world of the para - men ? Would they be in danger , too ? "
15990	16004	15879	15879	Lamont	91	" I 'm sure of it . A different danger , but danger . "
16040	16072	16037	16037	He	109	" If the para - men are more intelligent than we are , would they be running the Pump ? Surely they would know it was dangerous , before we did . "
16073	16080	16082	16082	Lamont	91	" I 've thought of that , "
16084	16121	16082	16082	Lamont	91	" What I guess is that they 've started Pumping for the first time and they , like us , got the process started for the apparent good it would bring and worried about consequences later . "
16124	16142	16037	16037	He	109	" But you say you know the consequences now . Would they be slower than you were ? "
16143	16186	16187	16187	Bronowski	109	" It depends on if and when they look for those consequences . The Pump is too attractive to try to spoil . I would n't have looked myself if I had n't — But what 's on your mind , Mike ? "
16200	16208	16187	16187	Bronowski	109	" I think we 've got something . "
16225	16237	16209	16209	Lamont	91	" With the para - symbols ? Tell me , Mike ! "
16238	16278	16037	16037	He	109	" It was while you were with Hallam . While you were actually with Hallam . I have n't known exactly what to do about it , because I was n't sure what was going on . And now — "
16279	16283	16209	16209	Lamont	91	" And now ? "
16284	16304	16209	16209	Lamont	91	" I 'm still not sure . One of their foils came through , with four symbols . . . "
16305	16308	16037	16037	He	109	" Oh ? "
16309	16324	16209	16209	Lamont	91	" . . . in the Latin alphabet . And it can be pronounced . "
16325	16328	16209	16209	Lamont	91	" What ? "
16329	16334	16335	16335	Bronowski	109	" Here it is . "
16381	16389	16391	16391	Lamont	91	" What do you suppose that means ? "
16395	16419	16391	16391	Lamont	91	" So far all I 've been able to think of is that it 's F - E - A - R misspelled . "
16420	16442	16805	16805	Bronowski	109	" Is that why you were cross - examining me ? You thought someone on the other side was experiencing fear ? "
16443	16477	16805	16805	Bronowski	109	" And I thought it might have some connection with your own obviously increasing excitement over the last month . Frankly , Pete , I did n't like being kept in the dark . "
16478	16518	16391	16391	Lamont	91	" Okay . Now let 's not jump to conclusions . You 're the one with experience with fragmentary messages . Would n't you say that the para - men were beginning to experience fear concerning the Electron Pump . "
16519	16525	16527	16527	Bronowski	109	" Not necessarily at all , "
16529	16589	16527	16527	Bronowski	109	" I do n't know how 52 much they can sense of this Universe . If they can sense the tungsten we lay out for them ; if they can sense our presence ; perhaps they are sensing our state of mind . Perhaps they are trying to reassure us ; telling us there is no reason to fear . "
16590	16607	16805	16805	Bronowski	109	" Then why do n't they say N - O F - E - E - R. "
16608	16620	16391	16391	Lamont	91	" Because they do n't know our language that well yet . "
16621	16633	16527	16527	Bronowski	109	" Hmm . Then I ca n't take it to Burt . "
16634	16671	16805	16805	Bronowski	109	" I would n't . It 's ambiguous . In fact , I would n't go to Burt till we get something more from the other side . Who knows what they 're trying to say . "
16672	16694	16391	16391	Lamont	91	" No , I ca n't wait , Mike . I know I 'm right , and we have no time . "
16695	16746	16747	16747	Lamont	91	" All right , but if you see Burt you 'll be burning your bridges . Your colleagues will never forgive you . Have you thought of talking to the physicists here . You ca n't put pressure on Hallam on your own , but a whole group of you — "
16753	16804	16749	16749	his	91	" Not at all . The men at this station survive by virtue of their jellyfish quality . There is n't one who would stand against him . Trying to rally the others to put pressure on Hallam would be like asking strands of cooked spaghetti to come to attention . "
16813	16819	16805	16805	Bronowski	109	" You may be right . "
16820	16827	16829	16829	Lamont	91	" I know I 'm right , "
17018	17030	16993	16993	He	432	" I can only give you half an hour , son . "
17083	17115	17080	17080	He	91	" I wo n't bother with the mathematics , Senator , but I will assume you realize that through Pumping , the natural laws of the two Universes are being mixed . "
17116	17120	17122	17123	the senator	432	" Stirred together , "
17127	17141	17122	17123	the senator	432	" with equilibrium coming in about io30 years . Is that the figure ? "
17162	17166	17168	17168	Lamont	91	" It is , "
17170	17214	17168	17168	Lamont	91	" but it is arrived at by assuming that the alien laws seeping into our Universe and theirs spread outward from the point of entry at the speed of light . That is just an assumption and I believe it to be wrong . "
17215	17218	17122	17123	the senator	432	" Why ? "
17219	17353	17354	17354	Lamont	91	" The only measured rate of mixing is within the plutonium- 186 sent into this Universe . That rate of mixing is extremely slow at first , presumably because matter is dense , and increases with time . If the plutonium is mixed with less dense matter , the rate of mixing increases more rapidly . From a few measurements of this sort it has been calculated that the permeation rate would increase to the speed of light in a vacuum . It would take some time for the alien laws to work their way into the atmosphere , far less time to work their way to the top of the 54 atmosphere and then off through space in every direction at 300,000 kilometers per second , thinning into harmlessness in no time . "
17375	17378	17379	17379	he	91	" However — "
17394	17439	17379	17379	he	91	" It 's a convenient assumption that seems to make sense and seems to make no trouble , but what if it is not matter that offers resistance to the permeation of the alien laws , but the basic fabric of the Universe itself . "
17440	17447	17122	17123	the senator	432	" What is the basic fabric ? "
17448	17546	17684	17684	his	432	" I ca n't put it in words . There is a mathematical expression which I think represents it , but I ca n't put it into words . The basic fabric of the Universe is that which dictates the laws of nature . It is the basic fabric of our Universe that makes it necessary for energy to be conserved . It is the basic fabric of the para - Universe , with a weave , so to speak , somewhat different from ours , that makes their nuclear interaction a hundred times stronger than ours . "
17547	17551	17379	17379	he	91	" And so ? "
17552	17629	17122	17123	the senator	432	" If it is the basic fabric that is being penetrated , sir , then the presence of matter , dense or not , can have only a secondary influence . The rate of penetration is greater in a vacuum than in dense mass , but not very much greater . The rate of penetration in outer space may be great in Earthly terms but it is only a small fraction of the speed of light . "
17630	17634	17684	17684	his	432	" Which means ? "
17635	17673	17379	17379	he	91	" That the alien fabric is not dissipating as quickly as we think , but is piling up , so to speak , within the Solar system to a much greater concentration than we have been assuming . "
17674	17678	17684	17684	his	432	" I see , "
17687	17715	17684	17684	his	432	" And how long then will it be before the space within the Solar system is brought to equilibrium . Less than 1030 years , I imagine . "
17716	17743	17379	17379	he	91	" Far less , sir . Less than 1010 years , I think . Perhaps fifty billion years , give or take a couple of billion . "
17746	17765	17379	17379	he	91	" Not much in comparison , but enough , eh ? No immediate cause for alarm , eh ? "
17766	17810	17684	17684	his	432	" But I 'm afraid that is immediate cause for alarm , sir . Damage will be done long before equilibrium is reached . Because of the Pumping , the strong nuclear interaction is growing steadily stronger in our Universe at every moment . "
17811	17817	17379	17379	he	91	" Enough stronger to measure . "
17818	17824	17379	17379	he	91	" Perhaps not , sir . "
17825	17834	17684	17684	his	432	" Not even after twenty years of Pumping ? "
17835	17841	17379	17379	he	91	" Perhaps not , sir . "
17842	17847	17379	17379	he	91	" Then why worry ? "
17848	17924	17684	17684	his	432	" Because , sir , upon the strength of the strong nuclear interaction rests the rate at which hydrogen fuses to helium in the core of the Sun . If the interaction strengthens even unnoticeably , the rate of hydrogen fusion in the Sun will increase markedly . The Sun maintains the balance between radiation and gravitation with great delicacy and to upset that balance in favor of radiation , as we are now doing — "
17929	17930	17379	17379	he	91	" "
18012	18013	18067	18067	I	0	" "
18020	18021	18067	18067	I	0	" "
18049	18056	18067	18067	I	0	" The senator cleared his throat . "
18097	18098	18090	18090	You	441	" "
18103	18117	18101	18101	sir	310	" A corner of Lamont 's mouth twitched but his voice held even . "
18123	18124	18125	18125	He	92	" "
18129	18143	18125	18125	He	92	" said the senator , glancing at a paper on his 56 desk , "
18163	18175	18154	18154	he	92	" Lamont said in a voice he strove to keep calm . "
18183	18184	18185	18185	His	92	" "
18189	18190	18185	18185	His	92	" "
18202	18203	18194	18194	you	310	" "
18286	18287	18280	18280	Hallam	92	" "
18296	18297	18289	18289	you	310	" "
18303	18304	18289	18289	you	310	" "
18314	18315	18289	18289	you	310	" "
18325	18326	18289	18289	you	310	" "
18330	18334	18335	18335	You	310	" demanded Lamont . "
18385	18386	18392	18392	you	310	" "
18427	18428	18429	18429	Sir	310	" "
18448	18449	18429	18429	Sir	310	" "
18477	18478	18479	18479	Sir	310	" "
18496	18497	18487	18487	Their	456	" "
18555	18589	18546	18546	me	0	" He looked at his wristwatch , leaned back and smiled . His offer was not characteristic of him , but an editorial in the Terrestrial Post that morning had referred to him as "
18601	18614	18546	18546	me	0	" and the glow that that had roused within him still lingered . "
18620	18624	18590	18592	a consummate politician	459	" he said , "
18753	18796	18797	18797	Lamont	91	" Now then , young man , do n't ask me to stop the Pumping . The economy and comfort of the entire planet depend on it . Tell me , instead , how to keep the Pumping from exploding the Sun . "
18800	18831	18797	18797	Lamont	91	" There is no way , Senator . We are dealing with something here that is so basic , we ca n't play with it . We must stop it . "
18832	18852	19083	19083	Lamont	91	" Ah , and you can suggest only that we go back to matters as they were before Pumping . "
18853	18857	18797	18797	Lamont	91	" We must . "
18858	18875	18797	18797	Lamont	91	" In that case , you will need hard and fast proof that you are right . "
18876	18881	18883	18883	Lamont	91	" The best proof , "
18887	18907	18883	18883	Lamont	91	" is to have the Sun explode . I suppose you do n't want me to go that far . "
18908	18925	18797	18797	Lamont	91	" Not necessary , perhaps . Why ca n't you get Hallam to back you up ? "
18927	18955	18883	18883	Lamont	91	" Because he is a small man who finds himself the Father of the Electron Pump . How can he admit his child will destroy the Earth ? "
18956	18990	18991	18991	Lamont	91	" I see what you mean , but he is still the Father of the Electron Pump to the whole world , and only his word would carry sufficient weight in this respect . "
18996	19011	18993	18993	his	91	" He would never give in . He would rather see the Sun explode . "
19016	19080	19012	19013	The senator	432	" Then force his hand . You have a theory but a theory by itself is meaningless . Surely there must be some way of checking it . The rate of radioactive breakdown of , say , uranium depends on the interactions within the nucleus . Has that rate been changing in a fashion predicted by your theory but not the standard one ? "
19088	19127	19085	19085	his	91	" Ordinary radioactivity depends on the weak nuclear interaction , and unfortunately , experiments of that sort will yield only borderline evidence . By the time it showed sufficiently to be unmistakable , it would be too late . "
19128	19134	19083	19083	Lamont	91	" What else , then ? "
19135	19173	19083	19083	Lamont	91	" There are pion interactions of a specific sort that might yield unmistakable data now . Better still there are quark - quark combinations that have produced puzzling results recently that I am sure I can explain — "
19174	19181	19085	19085	his	91	" Well , there you are . "
19182	19228	19083	19083	Lamont	91	" Yes , but in order to obtain that data , I must make use of the large proton synchrotron on the Moon , sir , and no time on that will be available for years — I've checked — unless someone pulls the strings . "
19229	19233	19083	19083	Lamont	91	" Meaning me ? "
19234	19240	19085	19085	his	91	" Meaning you , Senator . "
19241	19255	19083	19083	Lamont	91	" Not as long as Dr. Hallam says this about you , son . "
19272	19282	19257	19258	Senator Burt	119	" I ca n't get out on that limb . "
19283	19291	19085	19085	his	91	" But the existence of the world — "
19292	19296	19085	19085	his	91	" Prove it . "
19298	19307	19257	19258	Senator Burt	119	" Override Hallam and I 'll prove it . "
19308	19317	19318	19318	Lamont	91	" Prove it and I 'll override Hallam . "
19324	19359	19318	19318	Lamont	91	" Senator ! Suppose there 's just a trifling chance I 'm right . Is n't even that trifling chance worth fighting for ? It means everything ; all mankind , the entire planet — "
19360	19527	19528	19528	Lamont	91	" You want me to fight the good fight ? I 'd like to . There 's a certain drama in going down in a good cause . Any decent politician is masochistic enough to dream now and then of going down in flames while the angels sing . But , Dr. Lamont , to do that one has to have a fighting chance . One has to have something to fight for that may — just may — win out . If I back you , I 'll accomplish nothing with your word alone against the infinite desirability of Pumping . Shall I demand every man give up the personal comfort and affluence he has learned to get used to , thanks to the Pump , just because one man cries ' Doom ' while all the other scientists stand against him , and the revered Hallam calls him an idiot ? No , sir , I will not go down in flames for nothing . "
19531	19551	19528	19528	Lamont	91	" Then just help me find my proof . You need n't appear in the open if you fear — "
19552	19558	19560	19560	Burt	119	" I 'm not afraid , "
19564	19583	19560	19560	Burt	119	" I 'm being practical . Dr. Lamont , your half - hour is rather more than gone . "
20026	20040	20023	20023	He	121	" Let me get this straight . You 're speaking only for yourself ? "
20041	20044	20046	20046	Lamont	91	" Yes , "
20049	20078	20046	20046	Lamont	91	" Hallam does n't back me . In fact , Hallam says I 'm mad . Do you have to have Hallam 's approval before you can move ? "
20080	20088	20090	20090	Chen	121	" I need no one 's approval , "
20103	20119	20096	20096	he	121	" You say the para - men are farther advanced in technology than we are ? "
20140	20145	20131	20131	He	91	" Farther advanced in technology "
20155	20160	20162	20162	Lamont	91	" That is clear , "
20164	20183	20162	20162	Lamont	91	" if only because they can send material across the gap between the Universes and we ca n't . "
20184	20203	20204	20204	Lamont	91	" Then why did they start the Pump if it is dangerous ? Why are they continuing it ? "
20250	20291	20247	20247	Lamont	91	" They were anxious to get started with something that was so apparently desirable as a source of energy , just as we were . I have reason to think they 're as distrubed about it now as I am . "
20292	20310	20162	20162	Lamont	91	" That 's still your word . You have no definite evidence about their state of mind . "
20311	20321	20162	20162	Lamont	91	" None that I can present at this moment . "
20322	20329	20247	20247	Lamont	91	" Then it 's not enough . "
20330	20337	20162	20162	Lamont	91	" Can we afford to risk — "
20338	20382	20162	20162	Lamont	91	" It 's not enough , Professor . There 's no evidence . I have n't built my reputation by shooting down targets at random . My missiles have sped true to the mark every time because I knew what I was doing . "
20383	20391	20247	20247	Lamont	91	" But when I get the evidence — "
20392	20431	20247	20247	Lamont	91	" Then I 'll back you . If the evidence satisfies me , I assure you neither Hallam nor the Congress will be able to resist the tide . So get the evidence and come see me again . "
20432	20442	20443	20443	Chen	121	" But by then it will be too late . "
20446	20468	20443	20443	Chen	121	" Perhaps . Much more likely , you will find that you were wrong and no evidence is to be had . "
20469	20475	20476	20476	Lamont	91	" I 'm not wrong . "
20489	20578	20476	20476	Lamont	91	" Mr. Chen . There are very likely trillions upon 62 trillions of inhabited planets in the Universe , and among them there may be billions with intelligent life and highly developed technologies . The same is probably true of the para - Universe . It must be that in the history of the two Universes there have been many pairs of worlds that came into contact and began Pumping . There may be dozens or even hundreds of Pumps scattered across junction points of the two Universes . "
20579	20587	20247	20247	Lamont	91	" Pure speculation . But if so ? "
20588	20670	20247	20247	Lamont	91	" Then it may be that in dozens or hundreds of cases , the mixture of natural law advanced locally to an extent sufficient to explode a planet 's Sun . The effect might have spread outward . The energy of a supernova added to the changing natural law may have set off explosions among neighboring stars , which in turn set off others . In time perhaps an entire core of a galaxy or of a galactic arm will explode . "
20671	20681	20247	20247	Lamont	91	" But that is only imagination , of course . "
20682	20717	20247	20247	Lamont	91	" Is it ? There are hundreds of quasars in the Universe ; tiny bodies the size of several Solar systems but shining with the light of a hundred full - size ordinary galaxies . "
20718	20734	20247	20247	Lamont	91	" You 're telling me that the quasars are what are left of Pumping planets . "
20735	20781	20247	20247	Lamont	91	" I 'm suggesting that . In the century and a half since they were discovered , astronomers have still failed to account for their sources of energy . Nothing in this Universe will account for it ; nothing . Does n't it follow then — "
20782	20798	20247	20247	Lamont	91	" What about the para - Universe ? Is it full of quasars , too ? "
20799	20902	20247	20247	Lamont	91	" I would n't think so . Conditions are different there . Para - theory makes it seem quite definite that fusion takes place much more easily over there , so the stars must be considerably smaller than ours on the average . It would take a much smaller supply of easily - fusing hydrogen to produce the energy our Sun does . A supply as large as that of our Sun would explode spontaneously . If our laws permeate the para - Universe , hydrogen becomes a little more difficult to fuse ; the para - stars begin to cool down . "
20903	20912	20914	20914	Chen	123	" Well , that 's not so bad , "
20916	20939	20914	20914	Chen	123	" They can use Pumping to supply themselves with the necessary energy . By your speculations , they 're in fine shape . "
20941	20945	20947	20947	Lamont	91	" Not really , "
20962	21022	20247	20247	Lamont	91	" Once our end explodes , the Pumping stops . They ca n't keep it up without us , and that means they 'll face a cooling star without Pump - energy . They might be worse off than we ; we 'd go out in a painless flash while their agony would be long - drawn - out . "
21023	21032	21034	21034	Chen	123	" You have a good imagination , Professor , "
21036	21130	21034	21034	Chen	123	" but I 'm not buying it . I do n't see any chance of giving up Pumping on nothing more than your imagination . Do you know what the Pump means to mankind ? It 's not just the free , clean , and copious energy . Look beyond that . What it means is that mankind no longer has to work for a living . It means that for the first time in history , mankind can turn its collective brains to the more important problem of developing its true potential . "
21199	21204	21207	21207	You	123	" Lamont said angrily , "

21713	21745	21700	21700	You	123	" said Bronowski . Lamont was sitting in his laboratory , staring at the toes of his shoes and noting idly that they seemed unusually scuffed . He shook his head . "

24408	24464	24404	24404	I	0	" He was gone and Lamont was alone . He sat in his chair , fingers aimlessly drumming , drumming . Somewhere in the Sun , protons were clinging together with just a trifling additional avidity and with each moment that avidity grew and at some moment the delicate balance would break down . . . "
24478	24540	24474	24474	I	0	" cried out Lamont , and blinked and blinked to keep back the tears . 72 II . .. .The Gods Themselves ... la Dua did not have much trouble leaving the others . She always expected trouble , but somehow it never came . Never real trouble . But then why should it ? Odeen objected in his lofty way . "
24544	24549	24550	24550	You	91	" he would say . "
24556	25484	24554	24554	Tritt	157	" He never spoke of his own annoyance ; Rationals did n't grow annoyed over trifles . Still , he hovered over Tritt almost as persistently as Tritt hovered over the children . But then Odeen always let her have her way if she were persistent enough , and would even intercede with Tritt . Sometimes he even admitted he was proud of her ability , of her independence . ... He was n't a bad left - ling , she thought with absent - minded affection . Tritt was harder to handle and he had a sour way of looking at her when she was — well , when she was as she wished to be . But then right - lings were like that . He was a right - ling to her , but a Parental to the children and the latter took precedence always . . . . Which was good because she could always count on one child or the other taking him away just as things grew uncomfortable . Still , Dua did n't mind Tritt very much . Except for melting , she tended to ignore him . Odeen was another thing . He had been exciting at first ; just his presence had made her outlines shimmer and fade . And the fact that he was a Rational made him all the more exciting somehow . She did n't understand her reaction to that ; it was part of her queerness . She had grown used to her queerness — almost . Dua sighed . When she was a child , when she still thought of herself as an individual , a single being , and not as part of a triad , she 75 was much more aware of that queerness . She was much more made aware of it by the others . As little a thing as the surface at evening — She had loved the surface at evening . The other Emotionals had called it cold and gloomy and had quivered and coalesced when she described it for them . They were ready enough to emerge in the warmth of midday and stretch and feed , but that was exactly what made the midday dull . She did n't like to be around the twittering lot of them . She had to eat , of course , but she liked it much better in the evening when there was very little food , but everything was dim , deep red , and she was alone . Of course , she described it as colder and more wistful than it was when she talked to the others in order to watch them grow hard - edged as they imagined the chill — or as hard - edged as young Emotionals could . After a while , they would whisper about her and laugh at her — and leave her alone . The small sun was at the horizon now , with the secret ruddiness that she alone was there to see . She spread herself out laterally and thickened dorso - ventrally , absorbing the traces of thin warmth . She munched at it idly , savoring the slightly sour , substanceless taste of the long wave lengths . ( She had never met another Emotional who would admit to liking it . But she could never explain that she associated it with freedom ; freedom from the others , when she could be alone . ) Even now the loneliness , the chill , and the deep , deep red , brought back those old days before the triad ; and even more , quite sharply , her own Parental , who would come lumbering after her , forever fearful that she would hurt herself . He had been carefully devoted to her , as Parentals always were ; to their little - mids more than to the other two , as always . It had annoyed her and she would dream of the day when he would leave her . Parentals always did eventually ; and how she had missed him , when one day , he finally did . He had come to tell her , just as carefully as he could , despite the difficulty Parentals had in putting their feelings into words . 76 She had run from him that day ; not in malice ; not because she suspected what he had to tell her ; but only out of joy . She had managed to find a special place at midday and had gorged herself in unexpected isolation and had been filled with a queer , itching sensation that demanded motion and activity . She had slithered over the rocks and had let her edges overlap theirs . It was something she knew to be a grossly improper action for anyone but a baby and yet it was something at once exciting and soothing . And her Parental caught her at last and had stood before her , silent for a long time , making his eyes small and dense as though to stop every bit of light reflected from her ; to see as much as he could of her ; and for as long as possible . At first , she just stared back with the confused thought that he had seen her rub through the rocks and was ashamed of her . But she caught no shame - aura and finally she said , very subdued , "
25491	25492	25489	25489	Daddy	136	" "
25512	25513	25509	25509	you	134	" "
25517	25589	25590	25590	I	0	" Now that it was here , Dua stubbornly would not let herself know . If she refused to know , there would be nothing to know . ( She never quite got out of that habit . Odeen said all Emotionals were like that , in the lofty voice he used sometimes when he was particularly overcome with the importance of being a Rational . ) Her Parental had said , "
25604	25624	25625	25625	You	134	" Then he just stood and looked at her , and she could n't say anything . He said , "
25631	25632	25625	25625	You	134	" "
25635	25705	25625	25625	You	134	" Dua turned away rebelliously , her outlines vague and growing vaguer , trying to dissipate . She wanted to dissipate altogether and of course she could n't . After a while , it hurt and cramped and she hardened again . Her Parental did n't even bother to scold her and tell her that it would be shameful if anyone saw her stretched out so . She said , "
25711	25730	25706	25706	They	1836	" and immediately felt sorrowful 77 that her Parental would be hurt at that . He still called them "
25734	25736	25625	25625	You	134	" and "
25741	25797	25625	25625	You	134	" but little - left was all involved with his studies and little - right kept talking about forming a triad . Dua was the only one of the three who still felt — Well , she was the youngest . Emotionals always were and with them it was different . Her Parental only said , "
25804	25922	25798	25798	You	547	" And they stood looking at each other . She did n't want to tell them . They were n't close any more . It had been different when they were all little . They could hardly tell themselves apart in those days ; left - brother from rightbrother from mid - sister . They were all wispy and would tangle with each other and roll through each other and hide in the walls . No one ever minded that when they were little ; none of the grown - ups . But then the brothers grew thick and sober and drew away . And when she complained to her Parental , he would only say gently , "
25932	25950	25930	25930	Dua	134	" She tried not to listen , but left - brother kept drawing away and would say , "
25962	26016	26018	26018	Rationals	549	" And right - brother began to stay quite hard all the time and became glum and silent . She did n't understand it quite then and Daddy had not been able to make it clear . He would say every once in a while as though it were a lesson he had once learned—"Lefts
26033	26124	26125	26127	Left - Em	139	" She did n't like their way . They were no longer children and she still was , so she flocked with the other Emotionals . They all had the same complaints about their brothers . They all talked of coming triads . They all spread in the Sun and fed . They all grew more and more the same and every day the same things were said . And she grew to detest them and went off by herself whenever she could , so that they left and called her "
26129	26305	26125	26127	Left - Em	139	" ( It had been a long time now since she had heard that call , but she never thought of that phrase without remembering perfectly the thin 78 ragged voices that kept it up after her with a kind of half - wit persistence because they knew it hurt . ) But her Parental retained his interest in her even when it must have seemed to him that everyone else laughed at her . He tried , in his clumsy way , to shield her from the others . He followed her to the surface sometimes , even though he hated it himself , in order to make sure she was safe . She came upon him once , talking to a Hard One . It was hard for a Parental to talk to a Hard One ; even though she was quite young , she knew that much . Hard Ones talked only to Rationals . She was quite frightened and she wisped away but not before she had heard her Parental say , "
26315	26393	26306	26306	I	0	" Could the Hard One have inquired about her ? About her queerness , perhaps . But her Parental had not been apologetic . Even to the Hard One , he had spoken of his concern for her . Dua felt an obscure pride . But now he was leaving and suddenly all the independence that Dua had been looking forward to lost its fine shape and hardened into the pointed crag of loneliness . She said , "
26401	26402	26403	26403	I	0	" "
26411	26440	26441	26441	I	0	" He must . She knew that . Everyone , sooner or later , must . The day would come when she would have to sigh and say , "
26444	26445	26441	26441	I	0	" "
26477	26481	26482	26482	Your	552	" He said , "
26497	26498	26489	26490	The triad	554	" "
26507	26590	26504	26504	he	553	" She hardly ever saw her left - father or her mid - mother . They did n't count any more . Only her right - father , her Parental , her daddy , who stood there squat and flat - surfaced . He was n't all smooth - curved like a Rational or shuddery uneven like an Emotional , and she could always tell what he was going to say . Almost always . 79 She was sure he would say , "
26600	26613	26591	26591	I	0	" He said it . Dua said in a burst of woe , "
26673	26726	26663	26663	you	0	" And Daddy just stood there . There was no way he could handle an outburst like that except to come closer and pinch out a hand . It cost him a visible effort , but he held it out trembling and its outlines were ever so slightly soft . Dua said , "
26731	26781	26729	26729	Daddy	136	" and let her own hand flow about it so that his looked misty and shimmery through her substance ; but she was careful not to touch it for that would have embarrassed him so . Then he withdrew it and left her hand enclosing nothing and he said , "
26801	27254	26796	26796	I	0	" He went and she never saw him again . Now she sat there , remembering in the sunset , and rebelliously aware that pretty soon Tritt would grow petulant over her absence and nag Odeen . And then Odeen might lecture her on her duties . She did n't care . lb Odeen was moderately aware that Dua was off on the surface . Without really thinking about it , he could judge her direction and even something of her distance . If he had stopped to think of it , he might have felt displeasure , for this inter - awareness sense had been steadily deadening for a long time now and , without 80 really being certain why , he had a sense of gathering fulfillment about it . It was the way things were supposed to be ; the sign of the continuing development of the body with age . Tritt 's inter - awareness sense did not decrease , but it shifted more and more toward the children . That was clearly the line of useful development , but then the role of the Parental was a simple one , in a manner of speaking , however important . The Rational was far more complex and Odeen took a bleak satisfaction in that thought . Of course , it was Dua who was the real puzzle . She was so unlike all the other Emotionals . That puzzled and frustrated Tritt and reduced him to even more pronounced inarticulacy . It puzzled and frustrated Odeen at times , too , but he was also aware of Dua 's infinite capacity to induce satisfaction with life and it did not seem likely that one was independent of the other . The occasional exasperation she produced was a small price to pay for the intense happiness . And maybe Dua 's odd way of life was part of what ought to be , too . The Hard Ones seemed interested in her and ordinarily they paid attention only to Rationals . He felt pride in that ; so much the better for the triad that even the Emotional was worth attention . Things were as they were supposed to be . That was bedrock , and it was what he wanted most to feel , right down to the end . Someday he would even know when it was time to pass on and then he would want to . The Hard Ones assured him of that , as they assured all Rationals , but they also told him that it was his own inner consciousness that would mark the time unmistakably , and not any advice from outside . "
27260	27296	27256	27256	you	555	" Losten had told him — in the clear , careful way in which a Hard One always talked to a Soft One , as though the Hard One were laboring to make himself understood , "
27321	27327	27328	27328	I	0	" And Odeen had said , "
27350	27352	27356	27358	left - dear	557	" 81 "
27370	28102	27360	27360	You	557	" Odeen thought : How could I ever feel ready when I would never feel there was n't much to learn ? But he did n't say so . He was quite certain the time would come and he would then understand . He looked down at himself , almost forgetting and thrusting out an eye to do so — there were always some childish impulses in even the most adult of the most Rational . He did n't have to , of course . He could sense quite well with his eye solidly in place , and he found himself satisfactorily solid ; nice , sharp outline , smooth and curved into gracefully conjoined ovoids . His body lacked the strangely attractive shimmer of Dua , and the comforting stockiness of Tritt . He loved them both , but he would not change his own body for either . And , of course , his own mind . He would never say so , of course , for he would not want to hurt their feelings , but he never ceased being thankful that he did not have Tritt 's limited understanding or ( even more ) Dua 's erratic one . He supposed they did n't mind , for they knew nothing else . He grew distantly aware of Dua again , and deliberately dulled the sense . At the moment , he felt no need for her . It was not that he wanted her less , but merely that he had increasing drives elsewhere . It was part of the growing maturity of a Rational to find more and more satisfaction in the exercise of a mind that could only be practiced alone , and with the Hard Ones . He grew constantly more accustomed to the Hard Ones ; constantly more attached to them . He felt that was right and proper , too , for he was a Rational and in a way the Hard Ones were super - Rationals . ( He had once said that to Losten , the friendliest of the Hard Ones and , it seemed to Odeen in some vague way the youngest . Losten had radiated amusement but had said nothing . And that meant he had not denied it , however . ) Odeen 's earliest memories were filled with Hard Ones . His Parental more and more concentrated his attention on the last child , the baby - Emotional . That was only natural . Tritt would do 82 it , too , when the last child came , if it ever did . ( Odeen had picked up that last qualification from Tritt , who used it constantly as a reproach to Dua . ) But so much the better . With his Parental busy so much of the time , Odeen could begin his education that much the earlier . He was losing his baby ways and he had learned a great deal even before he met Tritt . That meeting , though , was surely something he would never forget . It might as well have been yesterday as more than half a lifetime ago . He had seen Parentals of his own generation , of course ; young ones who , long before they incubated the children that made true Parentals of them , showed few signs of the stolidity to come . As a child he had played with his own right - brother and was scarcely aware of any intellectual difference between them ( though , looking back on those days , he recognized that it was there , even then ) . He knew also , vaguely , the role of a Parental in a triad . Even as a child , he had heard whispered tales of melting . When Tritt first appeared , when Odeen saw him first , everything changed . For the first time in his life , Odeen felt an inner warmth and began to think that there was something he wanted that was utterly divorced from thought . Even now , he could remember the sense of embarrassment that had accompanied this . Tritt was not embarrassed , of course . Parentals were never embarrassed about the activities of the triad , and Emotionals were almost never embarrassed . Only Rationals had that problem . "
28107	28133	27360	27360	You	557	" a Hard One had said when Odeen had discussed the problem with him and that left Odeen dissatisfied . In what way could thinking be "
28136	28185	28186	28186	I	0	" ? Tritt was young when they first met , of course . He was still so childish as to be uncertain in his blockishness so that his reaction to the meeting was embarrassingly clear . He grew almost translucent along his edges . Odeen said , hesitantly , "
28200	28204	28194	28194	I	0	" Tritt said , "
28217	28602	28211	28211	I	0	" 83 They both knew exactly what had happened to them . The meeting had been arranged because someone ( some Parental , Odeen had thought at the time , but later he knew it was some Hard One ) thought they would suit each other , and the thought was correct . There was no intellectual rapport between the two , of course . How could there be when Odeen wanted to learn with an intensity that superseded anything but the existence of the triad itself , and Tritt lacked the very concept of learning ? What Tritt had to know , he knew beyond either learning or unlearning . Odeen , out of the excitement of finding out about the world and its Sun ; about the history and mechanism of life ; about all the abouts in the Universe ; sometimes ( in those early days together ) found himself spilling over to Tritt . Tritt listened placidly , clearly understanding nothing , but content to be listening ; while Odeen , transmitting nothing , was as clearly content to be lecturing . It was Tritt who made the first move , driven by his special needs . Odeen was chattering about what he had learned that day after the brief midday meal . ( Their thicker substance absorbed food so rapidly , they were satisfied with a simple walk in the Sun , while Emotionals basked for hours at a time , curling and thinning as though deliberately to lengthen the task . ) Odeen , who always ignored the Emotionals , was quite happy to be talking . Tritt who stared wordlessly at them , day after day , was now visibly restless . Abruptly , he came close to Odeen , formed an appendage so hastily as to clash most disagreeably on the other 's form - sense . He placed it upon a portion of Odeen 's upper ovoid where a slight shimmer was allowing a welcome draft of warm air as dessert . Tritt 's appendage thinned with a visible effort and sank into the superfices of Odeen 's skin before the latter darted away , horribly embarrassed . Odeen had done such things as a baby , of course , but never since his adolescence . "
28610	28625	28608	28608	Tritt	157	" he said sharply . Tritt 's appendage remained out , groping a little . "
28630	28650	28626	28626	I	0	" 84 Odeen held himself as compactly as he could , striving to harden the surface to bar entry . "
28657	28658	28608	28608	Tritt	157	" "
28662	28668	28608	28608	Tritt	157	" said Tritt , urgently . "
28674	28686	28608	28608	Tritt	157	" Odeen said the first thing that came into his mind . "
28690	28753	28608	28608	Tritt	157	" ( It did n't really . Not physically . But the Hard Ones always avoided the touch of the Soft Ones . A careless interpenetration hurt them , but they were constructed differently from Soft Ones , completely differently . ) Tritt was not fooled by that . His instinct could not possibly mislead him in this respect . He said , "
28759	28760	28608	28608	Tritt	157	" "
28775	28784	28785	28785	I	0	" And Tritt could only say , stubbornly , "
28791	28996	28785	28785	I	0	" It was bound to continue happening , and Odeen was bound to give in . He always did ; it was something that was sure to happen even to the most self - conscious Rational . As the old saying had it : Everyone either admitted doing it or lied about it . Tritt was at him at each meeting after that ; if not with an appendage , then rim to rim . And finally Odeen , seduced by the pleasure of it , began to help and tried to shine . He was better at that than Tritt was . Poor Tritt , infinitely more eager , huffed and strained , and could achieve only the barest shimmer here and there , patchily and raggedly . Odeen , however , could turn translucent all over his surface , and fought down his embarrassment in order to let himself flow against Tritt . There was skin - deep pentration and Odeen could feel the pulsing of Tritt 's hard surface under the skin . There was enjoyment , riddled with guilt . Tritt , as often as not , was tired and vaguely angry when it was all over . Odeen said , "
29025	29030	29014	29014	You	157	" And Tritt said , "
29037	29072	29014	29014	You	157	" Let 's get an Emotional ! Tritt 's simple drives never led him to anything but direct action . Odeen was not sure he could explain the complexities of life to the other . "
29083	29094	29014	29014	You	157	" he began gently . 85 Tritt said , abruptly . "
29111	29116	29117	29117	I	0	" Odeen was horrified . "
29125	29136	29014	29014	You	157	" he continued , unconsciously falling into his lecturing voice , "
29153	29162	29163	29163	I	0	" Tritt was not listening . He said , "
29167	29168	29163	29163	I	0	" "
29171	29177	29163	29163	I	0	" said Odeen , horrified . "
29217	29792	29206	29207	a Parental	1908	" He was sorry the instant he had said it and it was a lie anyway . He just did n't want to do anything at all that might offend the Hard Ones and impede his useful relationship with them . Tritt , however , showed no signs of minding and it occurred to Odeen that the other saw no point or merit in knowing anything he did not already know and would not consider the statement of the fact an insult . The problem of the Emotional kept coming up , though . Occasionally , they tried interpenetration . In fact , the impulse grew stronger with time . It was never truly satisfying though it had its pleasure and each time Tritt would demand an Emotional . Each time , Odeen threw himself deeper into his studies , almost as a defense against the problem . Yet at times , he was almost tempted to speak to Losten about it . Losten was the Hard One he knew best ; the one who took the greatest personal interest in him . There was a deadly sameness about the Hard Ones , because they did not change ; they never changed ; their form was fixed . Where their eyes were they always were , and always in the same place for all of them . Their skin was not exactly hard , but it was always opaque , never shimmered , never vague , never penetrable by another skin of its own type . They were not larger in size , particularly , than the Soft Ones , but they were heavier . Their substance was much denser and they had to be careful about the yielding tissues of the Soft Ones . Once when he had been little , really little , and his body had flowed almost as freely as his sister 's , he had been approached by 86 a Hard One . He had never known which one it was , but he learned in later life that they were all of them curious about baby - Rationals . Odeen had reached up for the Hard One , out of nothing but curiosity . The Hard One had sprung backward and later Odeen 's Parental had scolded him for offering to touch a Hard One . The scolding had been harsh enough for Odeen never to forget . When he was older he learned that the close - packed atoms of the Hard One 's tissues felt pain on the forcible penetration of others . Odeen wondered if the Soft One felt pain , too . Another young Rational once told him that he had stumbled against a Hard One and the Hard One had doubled up but that he himself had felt nothing — but Odeen was n't sure this was not just a melodramatic boast . There were other things he could not do . He liked rubbing against the walls of the cavern . There was a pleasant , warm feeling when he allowed himself to penetrate rock . Babies always did it , but it got harder to do as he grew older . Still , he could do it skin - deep and he liked it , but his Parental found him doing it and scolded him . He objected that his sister did it all the time ; he had seen her . "
29797	29802	29803	29803	She	566	" said the Parental . "
29808	30097	29805	29806	an Emotional	563	" At another time , when Odeen was absorbing a recording — he was older then — he had idly formed a couple of projections and made the tips so thin , he could pass one through the other . He began to do it regularly when he listened . There was a pleasant tickling sensation that made it easier to listen and made him nicely sleepy afterward . And his Parental caught him at that , too , and what he had said still made Odeen uncomfortable in remembering it . No one really told him about melting in those days . They fed him knowledge and educated him about everything except what the triad was all about . Tritt had never been told , either , but he was a Parental so he knew without being told . Of course , when Dua came at last , all was clear , even though she seemed to know less about it even than Odeen . 87 But she did n't come to them because of anything Odeen did . It was Tritt who broached the matter ; Tritt , who ordinarily feared the Hard Ones and avoided them mutely ; Tritt , who lacked Odeen 's self - assurance , in all but this respect ; Tritt , who on this one subject was driven ; Tritt — Tritt — Tritt — Odeen sighed . Tritt was invading his thoughts , because Tritt was coming . He could feel him , harsh , demanding , always demanding . Odeen had so little time to himself these days , just when he felt that he needed to think more than ever , to straighten out all the thoughts — "
30102	30154	30100	30100	Tritt	157	" he said . lc Tritt was conscious of his blockiness . He did n't think it ugly . He did n't think about it at all . If he did , he would consider it beautiful . His body was designed for a purpose and designed well . He said , "
30161	30162	30159	30159	Dua	134	" "
30166	30200	30159	30159	Dua	134	" mumbled Odeen , almost as though he did n't care . It annoyed Tritt to have the triad made so little of . Dua was so difficult and Odeen did n't care . "
30208	30209	30203	30203	you	157	" "
30225	30226	30227	30227	You	157	" "
30283	30284	30285	30285	She	134	" "
30293	30294	30285	30285	She	134	" "
30308	30315	30306	30306	Odeen	131	" Tritt 's voice was caressing , "
30325	30326	30323	30323	Dua	134	" "
30331	30359	30323	30323	Dua	134	" mumbled Odeen , and Tritt felt himself once more puzzled by the other 's clear embarrassment at the simplest statement of fact . 88 Tritt said , "
30371	30865	30362	30362	I	0	" Did Odeen remember that ? Did Odeen ever think of the triad and what it meant . Sometimes Tritt felt so frustrated he could — he could — Actually , he did n't know what to do , but he knew he felt frustrated . As in those old days when he wanted an Emotional and Odeen would do nothing . Tritt knew he did n't have the trick of talking in big , elaborate sentences . But if Parentals did n't talk , they thought . They thought about important things . Odeen always talked about atoms and energy . Who cared about atoms and energy ? Tritt thought about the triad and the babies . Odeen had once told him that the numbers of Soft Ones were gradually growing fewer . Did n't he care ? Did n't the Hard Ones care ? Did anyone care but the Parentals ? Only two forms of life on all the world , the Soft Ones and the Hard Ones . And food shining down on them . Odeen had once told him the Sun was cooling off . There was less food , he said , so there were less people . Tritt did n't believe it . The Sun felt no cooler than it had when he was a baby . It was just that people were n't worrying about the triads any more . Too many absorbed Rationals ; too many silly Emotionals . What the Soft Ones must do was concentrate on the important things of life . Tritt did . He tended to the business of the triad . The baby - left came , then the baby - right . They were growing and flourishing . They had to have a baby - mid , though . That was the hardest to get started and without a baby - mid there would be no new triad . What made Dua as she was ? She had always been difficult , but she was growing worse . Tritt felt an obscure anger against Odeen . Odeen always talked with all those hard words . And Dua listened . Odeen would talk to Dua endlessly till they were almost two Rationals . That was bad for the triad . Odeen should know better . It was always Tritt who had to care . It was always Tritt who had to do what had to be done . Odeen was the friend of the Hard Ones and yet he said nothing . They needed an Emotional 89 and yet Odeen would say nothing . Odeen talked to them of energy and not of the needs of the triad . It had been Tritt who had turned the scale . Tritt remembered that proudly . He had seen Odeen talking to a Hard One and he had approached . Without a shake in his voice , he had interrupted and said , "
30871	30950	30362	30362	I	0	" The Hard One turned to look at him . Tritt had never been so close to a Hard One . He was all of a piece . Every part of him had to turn when one part did . He had some projections that could move by themselves , but they never changed in shape . They never flowed and were irregular and unlovely . They did n't like to be touched . The Hard One said , "
30957	30986	30955	30955	Odeen	131	" He did not talk to Tritt . Odeen flattened . He flattened close to the ground ; more flattened than Tritt had ever seen . He said , "
31002	31019	30994	30994	My	0	" He stuttered and puffed and could not speak . Tritt could speak . He said , "
31027	31046	30994	30994	My	0	" Tritt knew that Odeen was embarrassed into speechlessness but he did n't care . It was time . "
31053	31061	31049	31051	left - dear	557	" said the Hard One to Odeen , "
31071	31110	31063	31063	you	131	" Hard Ones spoke as the Soft Ones did , but more harshly and with fewer overtones . They were hard to listen to . Tritt found them hard , anyway , though Odeen seemed used to it . "
31113	31128	31063	31063	you	131	" said Odeen , finally . The Hard One turned at last to Tritt . "
31143	31144	31063	31063	you	131	" "
31148	31152	31063	31063	you	131	" said Tritt , "
31158	31184	31189	31189	Tritt	157	" He kept his shape firmly at angles . He did not allow himself to be frightened . This was too important . He said , "
31191	31198	31189	31189	Tritt	157	" The Hard One seemed amused . "
31257	31258	31255	31255	Tritt	157	" "
31265	31266	31255	31255	Tritt	157	" "
31276	31299	31302	31302	you	157	" He was amused again . When he was quite gone , Odeen uplifted himself and thinned out angrily . He said , "
31315	31316	31309	31309	you	157	" "
31323	31324	31325	31325	He	575	" "
31344	31345	31339	31339	him	575	" "
31356	31357	31352	31352	I	0	" "
31363	31393	31352	31352	I	0	" Odeen was settling into normal shape . That meant he was n't angry any more . ( That relieved Tritt though he tried not to show it . ) "
31414	31415	31419	31419	you	157	" "
31425	31426	31419	31419	you	157	" "
31437	31438	31419	31419	you	157	" "
31448	31507	31508	31508	You	578	" But then they rubbed surfaces and stopped arguing and it was n't long after that that Dua came . It was Losten that brought her . Tritt did n't know that ; he did n't look at the Hard One . Only at Dua . But Odeen told him afterward that it was Losten that brought her . "
31511	31515	31508	31508	You	578	" said Tritt . "
31531	31532	31527	31527	he	579	" "
31535	31539	31527	31527	he	579	" said Odeen . "
31559	32029	31544	31544	He	579	" Tritt did n't believe him . He was quite sure that it was entirely because of himself that Dua was with them . Surely , there was never anyone like Dua in the world . Tritt had seen many Emotionals . They were all attractive . He would have accepted any one of them for proper melting . Once he saw Dua , he realized that none of the others would have suited . Only Dua . Only Dua . And Dua knew exactly what to do . Exactly . No one had ever shown her how , she told them afterward . No one had ever 91 talked to her about it . Even other Emotionals had n't , for she avoided them . Yet when all three were together , each knew what to do . Dua thinned . She thinned more than Tritt had ever seen a person thin . She thinned more than Tritt would ever have thought possible . She became a kind of colored smoke that filled the room and dazzled him . He moved without knowing he was moving . He immersed himself in the air that was Dua . There was no sensation of penetration , none at all . Tritt felt no resistance , no friction . There was just a floating inward and a rapid palpitation . He felt himself beginning to thin in sympathy , and without the tremendous effort that had always accompanied it . With Dua filling him , he could thin without effort into a thick smoke of his own . Thinning became like flowing , one enormous smooth flow . Dimly , he could see Odeen approaching from the other side , from Dua 's left . And he , too , was thinning . Then , like all the shocks of contact in all the world , he reached Odeen . But it was n't a shock at all . Tritt felt without feeling , knew without knowing . He slid into Odeen and Odeen slid into him . He could n't tell whether he was surrounding Odeen or being surrounded by him or both or neither . It was only — pleasure . The senses dimmed with the intensity of that pleasure and at the point where he thought he could stand no more , the senses failed altogether . Eventually , they separated and stared at each other . They had melted for days . Of course , melting always took time . The better it was the longer it took , though when it was over all that time seemed as though it had been an instant and they did not remember it . In later life , it rarely took longer than that first time . Odeen said , "
32034	32065	31544	31544	He	579	" Tritt only gazed at Dua , who had made it possible . She was coalescing , swirling , moving tremulously . She seemed most affected of the three . 92 "
32072	32078	32066	32066	We	582	" she said , hurriedly , "
32089	32179	32183	32183	you	583	" She had run off . They did not stop her . They were too overcome to stop her . But that was always the way afterward . She was always gone after a melting . No matter how successful it was , she would go . There seemed something in her that needed to be alone . It bothered Tritt . In point after point , she was different from other Emotionals . She should n't be . Odeen felt differently . He would say on many occasions , "
32229	32254	32220	32220	you	583	" Tritt did not understand that clearly . He knew only that she ought to do what ought to be done . He said , "
32264	32265	32266	32266	I	0	" "
32281	32301	32302	32302	You	157	" Odeen often scolded Dua himself for her queer ways but was always unwilling to let Tritt do so . "
32308	32375	32306	32306	Tritt	157	" he would say . Tritt did n't know what tact was exactly . And now — It had been so long since the first melting and still the baby - Emotional was not born . How much longer ? It was already much too long . And Dua , if anything , stayed by herself more and more as time went on . Tritt said . "
32382	32383	32376	32376	She	584	" "
32389	32393	32394	32394	You	157	" began Odeen . "
32438	32447	32448	32448	She	134	" But Odeen turned away . He said , "
32489	32891	32482	32482	I	0	" Tritt backed away . He had a great deal to say , but he did n't know how to say it . 93 2a Dua was aware of the left - right agitation concerning her in a dim and faraway manner and her rebelliousness grew . If one or the other , or both , came to get her , it would end in a melting and she raged against the thought . It was all Tritt knew , except for the children ; all Tritt wanted , except for the third and last child ; and it was all involved with the children and the still missing child . And when Tritt wanted a melting , he got it . Tritt dominated the triad when he grew stubborn . He would hold on to some simple idea and never let go and in the end Odeen and Dua would have to give in . Yet now she would n't give in ; she would n't — She did n't feel disloyal at the thought , either . She never expected to feel for either Odeen or Tritt the sheer intensity of longing they felt for each other . She could melt alone ; they could melt only through her mediation ( so why did n't that make her the more regarded ) . She felt intense pleasure at the three - way melting ; of course she did , it would be stupid to deny it ; but it was a pleasure akin to that which she felt when she passed through a rock wall , as she sometimes secretly did . To Tritt and Odeen , the pleasure was like nothing else they had ever experienced or could ever experience . No , wait . Odeen had the pleasure of learning , of what he called intellectual development . Dua felt some of that at times , enough to know what it might mean ; and though it was different from melting , it might serve as a substitute , at least to the point where Odeen could do without melting sometimes . But not so , Tritt . For him there was only melting and the children . Only . And when his small mind bent entirely upon that , Odeen would give in , and then Dua would have to . 94 Once she had rebelled . "
32919	32927	32979	32979	Dua	134	" Tritt had looked outraged at that . "
32940	32941	32942	32942	I	0	" "
32959	32976	32953	32953	I	0	" Odeen had looked embarrassed . He spent half his life being embarrassed . He said , "
32993	33005	32991	32991	children	1950	" He seemed to pulse , as he said the word . "
33012	33018	32991	32991	children	1950	" said Dua , sharply . "
33064	33065	32991	32991	children	1950	" "
33072	33079	32991	32991	children	1950	" said Odeen , still pulsing . "
33127	33132	33349	33349	Dua	134	" he added hastily . "
33135	33313	33349	33349	Dua	134	" said Tritt anxiously , but Odeen would say no more . They had a child eventually , a baby - Rational , a left - let , that flitted and thinned so that all three were in raptures and even Odeen would hold it and let it change shape in his hands for as long as Tritt would allow him to . For it was Tritt , of course , who had actually incubated it through the long pre - forming ; Tritt who had separated from it when it assumed independent existence ; and Tritt who cared for it at all times . After that , Tritt was often not with them and Dua was oddly pleased . Tritt 's obsession annoyed her , but Odeen's — oddly — pleased her . She became increasingly aware of his — importance . There was something to being a Rational that made it possible to answer questions , and somehow Dua had questions for him constantly . He was readier to answer when Tritt was not present . "
33342	33343	33323	33323	I	0	" "
33351	33357	33349	33349	Dua	134	" said Odeen , earnestly . "
33395	33396	33389	33389	you	131	" "
33430	33486	33423	33423	I	0	" She was perfectly aware that Odeen was looking at her as though he had never seen anyone as attractive and that if Tritt had been present , melting would have taken place at once . She even let herself thin out ; not much , but perceptibly , in deliberate coquettishness . Odeen said , "
33512	33513	33514	33514	You	131	" "
33526	33527	33543	33543	you	131	" "
33534	33535	33543	33543	you	131	" "
33547	33548	33543	33543	you	131	" "
33627	34133	34134	34134	You	598	" It was wonderful to have it explained , Dua thought . What she was told , she really knew ; but she did n't know the proper words ; the long science - words that Odeen knew . And it made sharper and more meaningful everything that happened . Occasionally now , in adult life , when she no longer feared that childish teasing ; when she shared in the prestige of being part of the Odeen - triad ; she tried to swarm with other Emotionals and to withstand the chatter and the crowding . After all , she did occasionally feel like a more substantial meal than she usually got and it did make for better melting . There was a joy — sometimes she almost caught the pleasure the others got out of it — in slithering and maneuvering for exposure to Sunlight ; in the luxurious contraction and condensation to absorb the warmth through greater thickness with greater efficiency . 96 Yet for Dua a little of that went quite a way and the others never seemed to have enough . There was a kind of gluttonous wiggle about them that Dua could not duplicate and that , at length , she could not endure . That was why Rationals and Parentals were so rarely on the surface . Their thickness made it possible for them to eat quickly and leave . Emotionals writhed in the Sun for hours , for though they ate more slowly , they actually needed more energy than the others — at least for melting . The Emotional supplied the energy , Odeen had explained ( pulsing so that his signals were barely understood ) , the Rational the seed , the Parental the incubator . Once Dua understood that , a certain amusement began to blend with her disapproval when she watched the other Emotionals virtually slurp up the ruddy Sunlight . Since they never asked questions , she was sure they did n't know why they did it and could n't understand that there was an obscene side to their quivering condensations , or to the way in which they went tittering down below eventually — on their way to a good melt , of course , with lots of energy to spare . She could also stand Tritt 's annoyance when she would come down without that swirling opacity that meant a good gorging . Yet why should they complain ? The thinness she retained meant a defter melting . Not as sloppy and glutinous as the other triads managed , perhaps , but it was the ethereality that counted , she felt sure . And the little - left and little - right came eventually , did n't they ? Of course , it was the baby - Emotional , the little - mid , that was the crux . That took more energy than the other two and Dua never had enough . Even Odeen was beginning to mention it . "
34143	34144	34141	34141	Dua	134	" "
34149	34155	34141	34141	Dua	134	" said Dua , hastily . "
34160	34164	34156	34158	Genia 's triad	599	" said Odeen , "
34171	34197	34200	34200	she	151	" Dua did n't like Genia . She never had . She was empty - headed even by Emotional standards . Dua said , loftily , "
34250	34270	34271	34271	Genia	151	" She imitated Genia 's tremulous signaling with deadly accuracy and Odeen was amused . But then he said , "
34303	34308	34309	34309	I	0	" Dua turned away . "
34339	34343	34334	34334	you	600	" Odeen said , "
34365	34366	34358	34358	He	157	" "
34398	34399	34382	34382	He	157	" "
34402	34408	34382	34382	He	157	" said Odeen , seriously . "
34489	34490	34491	34491	I	0	" "
34497	34503	34491	34491	I	0	" said Dua , rebelliously . "
34520	34521	34512	34512	Their	140	" "
34527	34586	34589	34589	they	140	" Dua was suddenly interested . She always thought they were immortal somehow ; that they were n't born ; that they did n't die . Who had ever seen a baby Hard One , for instance ? They did n't have babies . They did n't melt . They did n't eat . Odeen said , thoughtfully , "
34653	34654	34645	34645	they	140	" "
34658	34662	34645	34645	they	140	" said Dua . "
34667	34668	34669	34669	You	0	" "
34678	34679	34680	34684	A bunch of the Emotionals	607	" "
34728	34729	34709	34709	They	140	" "
34734	34740	34741	34741	I	0	" said Odeen , vehemently . "
34762	34763	34760	34760	Odeen	131	" "
34768	34769	34745	34745	I	0	" "
34772	34778	34745	34745	I	0	" said Dua , vehemently . "
34794	34798	34799	34799	I	0	" Odeen said , "
34809	34810	34811	34811	Rationals	549	" "
34822	34827	34813	34813	Parentals	1925	" But Odeen said , "
34890	34891	34871	34871	Losten	142	" "
34901	34902	34895	34895	you	0	" "
34949	34950	34934	34934	He	152	" "
34958	35774	34951	34951	I	0	" said Dua , and she had left Odeen abruptly . That had been not so long ago , and Odeen had not mentioned this Estwald again , but she knew he would , and she brooded about it up here in the Sunset . She had seen that artificial food that once ; a glowing sphere of light , like a tiny Sun , in a special cavern set up by the Hard Ones . She could taste its bitterness yet . Would they improve it ? Would they make it taste better ? Even delicious ? And would she have to eat it then and fill herself with it till the full sensation gave her an almost uncontrollable desire to melt . She feared that self - generating desire . It was different when the desire came through the hectic combined stimulation of left - ling and right - ling . It was the self - generation that meant she would be 99 ripe to bring about the initiation of a little - mid . And — and she did n't want to ! It was a long time before she would admit the truth to herself . She did n't want to initiate an Emotional ! It was after the three children were all born that the time would inevitably come to pass on , and she did n't want to . She remembered the day her Parental had left her forever , and it was never going to be like that for her . Of that she was fiercely determined . The other Emotionals did n't care because they were too empty to think about it , but she was different . She was queer Dua , the Left - Em ; that was what they had called her ; and she would be different . As long as she did n't have that third child , she would not pass on ; she would continue to live . So she was n't going to have that third child . Never . Neverl But how was she going to stave it off ? And how would she keep Odeen from finding out ? What if Odeen found out ? 2b Odeen waited for Tritt to do something . He was reasonably sure that Tritt would not actually go up to the surface after Dua . It would mean leaving the children and that was always hard for Tritt to do . Tritt waited , without speaking for a while , and when he left , it was in the direction of the children 's alcove . Odeen was almost glad when Tritt left . Not quite , of course , for Tritt had been angry and withdrawn so that interpersonal contact had weakened and the barrier of displeasure had arisen . Odeen could not help but be melancholy at that . It was like the slowing of the life - pulse . He sometimes wondered if Tritt felt it , too . . . . No , that was unfair . Tritt had the special relationship with the children . And as for Dua , who could tell what Dua felt ? Who could tell what any Emotional felt ? They were so different they made left 100 and right seem alike in everything but mind . But even allowing for the erratic way of Emotionals , who could tell what Dua — especially Dua — felt ? That was why Odeen managed to be almost glad when Tritt left , for Dua was the question . The delay in initiating the third child was indeed becoming too long and Dua was growing less amenable to persuasion , not more . There was a growing restlessness in Odeen himself , that he could not quite identify , and it was something he would have to discuss with Losten . He made his way down to the Hard - caverns , hastening his movements into a continuous flow that was not nearly as undignified as the oddly exciting mixture of wavering and rushing that marked the Emotional curve - along , or as amusing as the stolid weight - shift of the Parental — ( He had the keen thought - image of Tritt clumping in pursuit of the baby - Rational , who , of course , was almost as slippery , at his age , as an Emotional , and of Dua having to block the baby and bring him back , and of Tritt cluckingly undecided whether to shake the small life - object or enfold him with his substance . From the start , Tritt could thin himself more effectively for the babies than for Odeen and when Odeen rallied him about that , Tritt answered gravely , for of course he had no humor about such things , "
35784	35826	34951	34951	I	0	" ) Odeen was selfishly pleased with his own flow and thought it graceful and impressive . He had mentioned that once to Losten , to whom as his Hard - teacher , he confessed everything , and Losten had said , "
35875	35993	35872	35872	you	618	" Odeen was n't sure he understood about individuality . Did that mean being alone ? A Hard One was alone , of course . There were no triads among them . How did they stand it ? Odeen had still been quite young when the matter had come up . His relationship with the Hard Ones had only been beginning , and it suddenly struck him that he was n't sure that there 101 were no triads among them . That fact was common legend among the Soft Ones , but how correct was the legend ? Odeen thought about that and decided one must ask and not accept matters on faith . Odeen had said , "
36004	36060	35995	35995	you	618	" ( In later times , Odeen pulsed at the memory of that question . How incredibly naive to have asked it , and it was very little comfort that every Rational asked the question of a Hard One in some fashion , sooner or later — usually sooner . ) Losten answered quite calmly , "
36078	36079	36165	36167	little - left	1937	" "
36085	36086	36165	36167	little - left	1937	" "
36092	36117	36165	36167	little - left	1937	" And the Hard One changed the shape of his permanent sensory region in a fashion that Odeen eventually associated with amusement or pleasure . "
36133	36149	36126	36131	Just Hard Ones of one kind	622	" Odeen had to ask . It came out involuntarily , quite against his desire . "
36157	36158	36153	36153	you	618	" "
36175	36725	36169	36169	We	623	" Could Odeen be used to such a thing ? There was the Parental triad that had filled his life so far and the sure knowledge that he would at some not - too - distant time form a triad of his own . What was life without that ? He thought about it hard now and then . He thought about everything hard , as it came up . Sometimes he managed to catch a glimpse of what it might mean . That Hard Ones had only themselves ; neither left - brother , nor right - brother , nor mid - sister , nor melting , nor children , nor Parentals . They had only the mind , only the inquiry into the Universe . Perhaps that was enough for them . As Odeen grew older , he caught bits of understanding as to the joys of inquiry . They were almost enough — almost enough — and then he would think of Tritt and of Dua and decide that even all the Universe beside was not quite enough . Unless — It was odd , but every once in a while it seemed that there might come a time , a situation , a condition , when — Then he would lose the momentary glimpse , or , rather , glimpse of a 102 glimpse , and miss it all . Yet in time it would return and lately he thought it grew stronger and would remain almost long enough to be caught . But none of that was what should involve him now . He had to see about Dua . He made his way along the well - known route , along which he had first been taken by his Parental ( as Tritt would soon take their own young Rational , their own baby - left . ) And , of course , he was instantly lost in memory again . It had been frightening , then . There had been other young Rationals , all pulsing and shimmering and changing shape , despite the Parental signals on every side to stay firm and smooth and not disgrace the triad . One small left , a playmate of Odeen , had , in fact , flattened thin , baby - fashion , and would not unflatten , despite all the efforts of his horribly embarrassed Parental . ( He had since become a perfectly normal student . . . . Though no Odeen , as Odeen himself could not help realizing with considerable complacency . ) They met a number of Hard Ones on that first day of school . They stopped at each , in order that the young - Rational vibration pattern might be recorded in several specialized ways and for a decision to be reached as to whether to accept them for instruction then , or to wait another interval ; and if then , for what kind of instruction . Odeen , in a desperate effort , had drawn himself smooth as a Hard One approached , and held himself unwavering . The Hard One said ( and the first sound of the odd tones of his voice almost undid Odeen 's determination to be grown - up ) , "
36743	36756	36737	36737	you	625	" It was the first time Odeen had ever been called ' left "
36778	36785	36773	36773	he	625	" Odeen , Hard - sir , "
36868	36870	36848	36849	His Parental	1990	" learn "
36925	37048	36915	36925	The Hard One who had first called him ' left "	143	" was his first teacher . The Hard One taught him to interpret the wave recordings so that after a while what seemed an incomprehensible code became words ; words just as clear as those he could form with his own vibrations . But then that first one did n't appear any more and another Hard One took over . It was a time before Odeen noticed . It was difficult in those early days to tell one Hard One from another , to differentiate among their voices . But then he grew certain . Little by little , he grew certain and he trembled at the change . He did n't understand its significance . He gathered courage and finally asked , "
37058	37059	37054	37056	Hard - sir	556	" "
37073	37085	37063	37063	He	154	" Odeen was speechless for a moment . Then he said , "
37094	37520	37063	37063	He	154	" He did not quite finish the phrase . It choked off . The new Hard One was passive , said nothing , volunteered nothing . It was always to be like that , Odeen found out . They never talked about themselves . On every other subject they discoursed freely . Concerning themselves — nothing . From dozens of pieces of evidence , Odeen could not help but decide that Hard Ones passed on ; that they were not immortal ( something so many Soft Ones took for granted ) . Yet no Hard One ever said as much . Odeen and the other student - Rationals sometimes discussed it , hesitantly , uneasily . Each brought in some small item that pointed inexorably to mortality of the Hard 104 Ones and wondered and did not like to conclude the obvious , so they let it go . The Hard Ones did not seem to mind that hints of mortality existed . They did nothing to mask it . But they never mentioned it , either . And if the question was asked directly ( sometimes it was , inevitably ) they never answered ; neither denying nor affirming . And if they passed on , they had to be born also , yet they said nothing of that and Odeen never saw a young Hard One . Odeen believed the Hard Ones got their energy from rocks instead of from the Sun — at least that they incorporated a powdered black rock into their bodies . Some of the other students thought so , too . Others , rather vehemently , refused to accept that . Nor could they come to a conclusion for no one ever saw them feeding in any way and the Hard Ones never spoke of that either . In the end , Odeen took their reticence for granted — as part of themselves . Perhaps , he thought , it was their individuality , the fact that they formed no triads . It built a shell about them . And then , too , Odeen learned things of such grave import that questions concerning the private life of the Hard Ones turned to trivia in any case . He learned , for instance , that the whole world was shriveling — dwindling — It was Losten , the new teacher , who told him that . Odeen had asked about the unoccupied caverns that stretched so endlessly into the bowels of the world and Losten had seemed pleased . "
37531	37659	37522	37522	you	633	" ( He was Odeen now ; not some general reference to his lefthood . It was always a source of pride to hear a Hard One address him by personal name . Many did so . Odeen was a prodigy of understanding and the use of his name seemed a recognition of the fact . More than once Losten had expressed satisfaction at having him as a pupil . ) Odeen was indeed afraid and , after some hesitation , said so . It was always easier to confess shortcomings to the Hard Ones than to fellow - Rationals ; much easier than to confess them to Tritt , unthinkable to confess them to Tritt . . . . Those were the days before Dua . 105 "
37666	37676	37663	37663	you	634	" Odeen hesitated again . Then he said slowly . "
37755	37760	37730	37730	I	0	" Losten looked pleased . "
37841	37842	37848	37850	Hard - sir	556	" "
37852	37878	37848	37850	Hard - sir	556	" Odeen felt uneasily compelled to use the honorific whenever he was too obviously in the presence of knowledge he lacked that the other had . "
37942	37943	37935	37940	fewer than ten thousand Soft Ones	642	" "
37946	37984	37935	37940	fewer than ten thousand Soft Ones	642	" said Odeen , shocked . ( Only three hundred Hard Ones left . This was surely an open admission that Hard Ones passed on , but this was not the time to think of that . ) "
38008	38060	37935	37940	fewer than ten thousand Soft Ones	642	" ( Well , then , did not that mean the Hard Ones gave birth , too ? And did it mean that the Hard Ones depended on the Sun for food , too , and not on rocks . Odeen filed the thought away and dismissed it for now . ) "
38065	38069	37935	37940	fewer than ten thousand Soft Ones	642	" Odeen asked . "
38086	38088	37935	37940	fewer than ten thousand Soft Ones	642	" 106 "
38111	38112	37935	37940	fewer than ten thousand Soft Ones	642	" "

38195	38196	38154	38154	Odeen	131	" "
38214	38223	38283	38286	my left - dear	644	" Odeen considered that rebelliously , then said , "
38239	38280	38228	38228	We	638	" He was palpitating as he said it . He had expanded with quite unforgivable discourtesy until he had swelled translucently into a size distinctly larger than the Hard One . But Losten merely expressed extreme pleasure . He said , "
38295	38312	38288	38289	The others	1836	" Odeen had collapsed to normal size in mingled embarrassment and pleasure at hearing himself addressed as "
38317	38543	38288	38289	The others	1836	" a phrase he had never heard anyone use to him — except Tritt , of course . It had not been very long after that that Losten himself had brought them Dua . Odeen had wondered , idly , if there had been any connection , but after a while wonder burned itself out . Tritt had repeated so often that it was his own approach to Losten that had brought them Dua , that Odeen gave up thinking about it . It was too confusing . But now he was coming to Losten again . A long time had passed since those earlier days when he first learned that the Universe was coming to an end and that ( as it turned out ) the Hard Ones were resolutely laboring to live on anyway . He himself had become adept in many fields and Losten confessed that in physics there was little he could any longer teach Odeen that a Soft One could profitably learn . And there were other young Rationals to take in hand , so he did not see Losten as frequently as he once did . 107 Odeen found Losten with two half - grown Rationals in the Radiation Chamber . Losten saw him at once through the glass and came out , closing the door carefully behind him . "
38549	38586	38544	38544	My	0	" he said , holding out his limbs in a gesture of friendship ( so that Odeen , as so often in the past , experienced a perverse desire to touch , but controlled it ) . "

38771	38801	38757	38757	you	0	" His expression was one that Odeen had grown to associate with melancholy . Odeen waited a moment , then decided to tackle the matter directly . He said , "
38823	38827	38829	38829	you	0	" Losten said , "
38855	38856	38842	38842	you	0	" "

38892	38898	38903	38903	Dua	134	" said Odeen , thoughtfully . "

38933	38948	38949	38949	She	134	" Losten listened gravely ; to all appearances unembarrassed . 108 Odeen went on . "
38974	38978	38949	38949	She	134	" Losten said , "
39007	39008	39009	39010	The children	1906	" "
39015	39019	39009	39010	The children	1906	" said Odeen . "
39041	39062	39037	39037	you	0	" ( It suddenly seemed to Odeen that Losten could n't possibly understand all the subtleties of the triad . ) "
39068	39072	39063	39063	I	0	" said Losten . "
39107	39111	39112	39112	I	0	" Odeen considered . "

39330	39341	39319	39322	no Rational in history	656	" said Odeen , trying not to seem unduly elated . "
39350	39362	39319	39322	no Rational in history	656	wrong"—and Losten seemed slightly amused at the other 's sudden loss of shimmer—"but

39720	39727	39709	39709	Dua	134	" Losten looked at him gravely . "

40000	40018	39997	39997	I	0	" Odeen wondered how Losten could possibly think him ignorant of so elementary a bit of knowledge . "

40050	40051	39997	39997	I	0	" "

40188	40189	40174	40174	she	134	" "
40193	40201	40202	40202	I	0	" Odeen paused to think it out . "
40240	40242	40233	40233	I	0	" 111 "
40254	40259	40245	40246	a philosopher	671	" said Losten dryly . "
40319	40320	40317	40317	Dua	134	" "
40326	40332	40317	40317	Dua	134	" said Odeen , wretchedly . "
40361	40362	40352	40352	Dua	134	" "
40375	40376	40377	40377	She	134	" "
40388	40395	40377	40377	She	134	" mumbled Odeen . Losten said , "
40432	40436	40428	40428	you	142	" Odeen said , "
40445	40446	40438	40438	Dua	134	" "
40475	40476	40467	40467	she	134	" "
40496	40497	40486	40486	I	0	" "
40522	40592	40593	40593	I	0	" ( Odeen looked up at Losten with sudden consternation . Once Dua had told him of her childhood unhappiness ; only once ; of the shrill calls of the other Emotionals ; of the filthy name they had called her — Left - Em . Had Losten heard of that , somehow ? . . . But he was only looking calmly at Odeen . ) Odeen said , "
40601	40607	40593	40593	I	0	" Then he burst out , "
40616	40617	40612	40612	her	134	" "
40623	40627	40612	40612	her	134	" said Losten . "
40671	40673	40665	40665	your	0	" 112 "
40707	40708	40692	40692	Tritt	157	" "
40750	40772	40773	40773	You	0	" It was as though an enormous feeling of impending disaster had been lifted from Odeen . He said , hurriedly , "
40813	40814	40816	40816	me	0	" "
40818	40823	40816	40816	me	0	" Losten was amused . "
40851	40852	40835	40835	He	152	" "
40857	41250	40835	40835	He	152	" said Odeen , momentarily discomfited . He had never yet seen Estwald . In fact , he had not yet met a Soft One who had actually met him though some reported having seen him in the distance now and then . Estwald was a new Hard One ; new , at least , in the sense that when Odeen had been young , he had never heard him mentioned . Did n't that mean that Estwald was a young Hard One , had been a child Hard One when Odeen had been a child Soft One . But never mind that . Right now , Odeen wanted to get back home . He could n't touch Losten in gratitude , but he could thank him again and then hasten away joyfully . There was a selfish component to his joy . It was not just the distant prospect of the baby - Emotional and the thought of Tritt 's pleasure . It was not even the thought of Dua 's fulfillment . What counted with him at this very moment was the immediate gleeful prospect ahead . He was going to be able to teach . No other Rational could feel the pleasure of so doing , he was sure , for no other Rational could possibly have an Emotional like Dua as part of the triad . It would be wonderful , if only Tritt could be made to understand the necessity . He would have to talk to Tritt , somehow persuade him to be patient . X13 2c Tritt had never felt less patient . He did not pretend to understand why Dua acted the way she did . He did not want to try . He did not care . He never knew why Emotionals did what they did . And Dua did n't even act like the other Emotionals . She never thought about the important thing . She would look at the Sun . But then she would thin out so that the light and food would just pass through her . Then she would say it was beautiful . That was not the important thing . The important thing was to eat . What was beautiful about eating ? What was beautiful ? She always wanted to melt differently . Once she said , "
41268	41274	41276	41276	her	680	" Odeen would always say , "
41290	41327	41278	41278	her	680	" Odeen was always patient . He always thought things would be better when they waited . Or else he would want to think it out . Tritt was n't sure he knew what Odeen meant by "
41332	41447	41278	41278	her	680	" It seemed to him it just meant that Odeen did nothing . Like getting Dua in the first place . Odeen would still be thinking it out . Tritt went right up and asked . That was the way to be . Now Odeen would n't do anything about Dua . What about the baby - Emotional , which was what mattered . Well , Tritt would do something about it , if Odeen did n't . In fact , he was doing something . He was edging down the long corridor even as all this was going through his mind . He was hardly aware he had come this far . Was this "
41451	41669	41278	41278	her	680	" ? Well , he would not let himself be frightened . He would not back away . Stolidly , he looked about him . This was the way to the Hard- 114 caverns . He knew he would be going that way with his little - left before very long . He had been shown the way by Odeen once . He did not know what he would do when he got there this time . Still , he felt no fright at all . He wanted a baby - Emotional . It was his right to have a baby - Emotional . Nothing was more important than that . The Hard Ones would see he got one . Had n't they brought them Dua when he had asked ? But who would he ask ? Could it be any Hard One ? Dimly , he had made up his mind not any Hard One . There was the name of one he would ask for . Then he would talk to him about it . He remembered the name . He even remembered when he had first heard the name . It was the time when the little - left had grown old enough to begin changing shape voluntarily . ( What a great day ! "
41693	41758	41689	41689	Dua	134	" And they had rushed in . Annis was the only child then . They had had to wait so long for the second . So they rushed in and he was just plastered in the corner . He was curling at himself and flowing over his resting place like wet clay . Odeen had left because he was busy . But Dua said , "
41769	41822	41767	41767	Tritt	157	" They had watched for hours and he did n't . ) Tritt was hurt that Odeen had n't waited . He would have scolded but Odeen looked so weary . There were definite wrinkles in his ovoid . And he made no effort to smooth them out . Tritt said anxiously , "
41829	41830	41827	41827	Odeen	131	" "
41851	41875	41835	41835	I	0	" ( Tritt did n't remember the exact hard words . It was something like that . Odeen always used hard words . ) "
41883	41884	41877	41877	you	157	" "
41924	41925	41926	41929	A new Hard One	2185	" "
41931	41965	41968	41968	he	131	" said Tritt , with distinct lack of interest . Odeen found sharp interest in associating with Hard Ones , but Tritt wished the interest did n't exist . Odeen was more intent on "
42014	42020	42022	42022	Odeen	131	" He 's called Estwald , "
42024	42027	42022	42022	Odeen	131	" Estwald ? "
42048	42062	42040	42040	he	157	" I 've never seen him , but they all talk about him . "
42078	42090	42063	42063	Odeen	131	" He 's responsible for that new thing they 've got . "
42091	42096	42040	42040	he	157	" What new thing ? "
42097	42126	42040	42040	he	157	" The Positron Pu — You would n't understand , Tritt . It 's a new thing they have . It 's going to revolutionize the whole world . "
42127	42132	42063	42063	Odeen	131	" What 's revolutionize ? "
42133	42138	42139	42139	Tritt	157	" Make everything different . "
42145	42153	42139	42139	Tritt	157	" They must n't make everything different . "
42154	42183	42063	42063	Odeen	131	" They 'll make everything better . Different is n't always worse . Anyway , Estwald is responsible . He 's very bright . I get the feeling . "
42184	42193	42063	42063	Odeen	131	" Then why do n't you like him ? "
42194	42205	42139	42139	Tritt	157	" I did n't say I did n't like him . "
42206	42217	42063	42063	Odeen	131	" You feel as though you do n't like him . "
42218	42236	42237	42237	Odeen	131	" Oh , nothing of the sort , Tritt . It 's just that somehow — somehow — "
42240	42306	42237	42237	Odeen	131	" I 'm jealous . Hard Ones are so intelligent that a Soft One is nothing in comparison , but I got used to that , because Losten was always telling me how bright I was — for a Soft One , I suppose . But now this Estwald comes along , and even Losten seems lost in admiration , and I 'm really nothing . "
42327	42354	42319	42319	Odeen	131	" But that 's just stupidity on my part . Who cares how smart a Hard One is ? Not one of them has a Tritt . "
42443	42447	42439	42439	He	131	" the New One "
42462	42469	42470	42470	he	131	" I think I avoid him , "
42481	42510	42470	42470	he	131	" because he knows so much about the new device . I do n't want to find out too soon . It 's too much fun to learn . "
42511	42516	42517	42517	Dua	134	" The Positron Pump ? "
42588	42605	42583	42583	Estwald	152	" I 've talked to Odeen about it , Tritt , and you must n't worry . "
42690	42698	42685	42685	He	157	" I want my little - mid . "
42765	42770	42771	42771	he	157	" Hard - sir , "
42817	42849	42805	42807	the Hard One	1961	" Why , it 's a right . What is your business here ? Do you have your little - left with you ? Is today the start of a semester ? "
42858	42867	42855	42855	He	157	" Where can I find Estwald , sir ? "
42868	42872	42888	42888	he	1961	" Find whom ? "
42873	42876	42877	42879	The Hard One	1961	" Estwald . "
42891	42901	42888	42888	he	1961	" What is your business with Estwald , right ? "
42906	42923	42888	42888	he	1961	" It is important I speak to him . Are you Estwald , Hard - sir ? "
42924	42941	42888	42888	he	1961	" No , I am not . . . . What is your name , right ? "
42942	42949	42888	42888	he	1961	" Tritt , Hard - sir . "
42950	42967	42888	42888	he	1961	" I see . You 're the right of Odeen 's triad , are n't you ? "
42968	42971	42972	42974	The Hard One	143	" Yes . "
42981	43006	42972	42974	The Hard One	143	" I 'm afraid you ca n't see Estwald at the moment . He 's not here . If anyone else can help you — "
43025	43047	43020	43022	The Hard One	143	" You go home now . Talk to Odeen . He 'll help you . Yes ? Go home , right . "
43318	43328	43315	43315	He	157	" I am going home , Hard - sir . "
43569	43593	43594	43594	She	134	" You 're a queer one , Dua , dear . You 're a funny little midling . What will become of you ? "
43652	43660	43649	43649	He	1964	" Why do you ask , Dua ? "
43693	43697	43685	43690	another Emotional of her own age	709	" Left - Em "
43759	43765	43748	43748	He	1964	" I do n't know , "
43785	43795	43777	43777	she	134	" Am I a Left - Em , Daddy ? "
43801	43816	43797	43797	he	1964	" Who called you that , Dua ? You must not repeat such words . "
43833	43838	43839	43839	He	1964	" Is it bad ? "
43842	43850	43839	43839	He	1964	" You 'll grow out of it , "
43903	43911	43899	43899	He	1964	" You 'll grow out of it , "
44131	44144	44127	44127	Dua	134	" Doral , do you know what a Left - Em is ? "
44164	44195	44151	44151	herself	160	" It 's an Emotional that acts like a Rational ; you know like a left . Get it ! Left - Emotional — Left - Em ! Get it ! "
44199	44201	44236	44236	Dua	134	" got "
44239	44245	44236	44236	Dua	134	" How do you know ? "
44246	44253	44254	44254	Doral	160	" The older girls told me . "
44265	44270	44271	44271	Doral	160	" It 's dirty , "
44274	44277	44279	44279	Dua	134	" Why ? "
44281	44294	44279	44279	Dua	134	" Because it 's dirty . Emotionals should n't act like Rationals . "
44311	44317	44308	44308	She	134	" Why should n't they ? "
44318	44331	44332	44332	Dua	134	" Because ! You want to know something else that 's dirty ? "
44339	44342	44343	44343	Doral	160	" What ? "
44380	44386	44374	44374	She	134	" Do n't do that . "
44387	44402	44374	44374	She	134	" You know what else is dirty ? You can go into a rock . "
44403	44410	44412	44412	Dua	134	" No , you ca n't , "
44462	44503	44412	44412	Dua	134	" Yes , you can . It 's called rock - rubbing . Emotionals can do it easy . Lefts and rights can only do it as babies . When they grow up , they do it with each other . "
44504	44517	44412	44412	Dua	134	" I do n't believe you . You 're making it up . "
44518	44531	44412	44412	Dua	134	" They do , I tell you . Do you know Dimit ? "
44532	44535	44412	44412	Dua	134	" No . "
44536	44552	44412	44412	Dua	134	" Sure you do . She 's the girl with the thick corner from Cavern c. "
44553	44562	44412	44412	Dua	134	" Is she the one who flows funny . "
44563	44622	44412	44412	Dua	134	" Yes . On account of the thick corner . That 's the one . She got into a rock all the way once — except for the thick corner . She let her left - brother watch her do it and he told their Parental and what she got for that . She never did it again . "
44964	44968	44922	44922	Tritt	157	" Left - Em "
45075	45093	45070	45070	She	134	" You 're a bunch of Right - Ems , a bunch of dirty Right - Ems , "
45688	45693	45684	45684	Odeen	131	" They 're talking . "
45702	45713	45684	45684	Odeen	131	" Their kind of talk . They understand each other . "
45742	45767	45768	45768	She	134	" None of the other Rationals I 've ever met have anything but an empty - head for an Emotional . I 'm lucky . "
45772	45793	45768	45768	She	134	" But the other Rationals seem to like empty- 124 heads . Why are you different from them , Odeen ? "
45811	45848	45807	45807	He	131	" I 've never figured it out and I do n't think it 's important that I do . I 'm pleased with you and I 'm pleased that I 'm pleased . ) She said , "
45857	45858	45807	45807	He	131	" "
45862	45866	45807	45807	He	131	" said Odeen . "
45939	45943	45934	45934	You	760	" Dua demurred . "
45956	45957	45950	45950	They	2243	" "
45978	45979	45981	45981	I	0	" "
45985	45986	45981	45981	I	0	" "
46007	46008	45998	45998	I	0	" "
46011	46012	46013	46013	I	0	" "
46016	46046	46013	46013	I	0	" Feeling rather fluttery , Dua let herself reach out to the Hard Ones , and adopted the total passivity that allowed the influx of feelings . She said , "
46056	46060	46049	46049	They	2243	" Odeen said , "
46066	46081	46064	46064	Estwald	152	" It was the first time Dua had heard the name . She said , "
46086	46087	46064	46064	Estwald	152	" "
46092	46093	46094	46094	I	0	" "
46108	46113	46114	46114	They	2243	" Odeen looked thoughtful . "
46121	46122	46114	46114	They	2243	" "
46129	46228	46114	46114	They	2243	" It was just at that time that the Hard Ones spied them . They approached in a friendly manner and greeted them in SoftOne fashion of speech . Dua was horribly embarrassed and wondered if they knew she had been sensing them . If they did , though , they said nothing . 125 ( Odeen told her afterward that it was quite rare to come upon Hard Ones talking among themselves in their own fashion . They always deferred to the Soft Ones and seemed always to suspend their own work when Soft Ones were there . "
46235	46239	46229	46229	They	2243	" said Odeen . "
46245	46374	46240	46240	They	2243	" ) Once in awhile he would take her down to the Hard - cavems — usually when Tritt was entirely wrapped up in the children . Nor did Odeen go out of his way to tell Tritt that he had taken Dua down . It was sure to evoke some response to the effect that Odeen 's coddling simply encouraged Dua 's reluctance to sun herself and just made the melting that much more ineffective . ... It was hard to talk to Tritt for more than five minutes without melting coming into the conversation . She had even come down alone once or twice . It had always frightened her a little to do so , though the Hard Ones she met were always friendly , always "
46378	46427	46240	46240	They	2243	" as Odeen said . But they did not seem to take her seriously . They were pleased , but somehow amused — she could feel that definitely — when she asked questions . And when they answered it was in a simple way that carried no information . "
46434	46439	46432	46432	Dua	134	" they would say . "
46448	46568	46440	46440	Odeen	131	" She wondered if she had met Estwald . She never quite dared ask the names of the Hard Ones she met ( except Losten , to whom Odeen had introduced her , and of whom she heard a great deal ) . Sometimes it seemed to her that this Hard One or that might be he . Odeen talked about him with great awe and with some resentment . She gathered that he was too engaged in work of the deepest importance to be in the caverns accessible to the Soft Ones . She pieced together what Odeen told her and , little by little , discovered that the world needed food badly . Odeen hardly ever called it "
46571	46574	46440	46440	Odeen	131	" He said "
46576	46701	46704	46704	Tritt	157	" instead , and said it was the Hard - One word for it . The Sun was fading and dying but Estwald had discovered how to find energy far away , far beyond the Sun , far beyond the seven stars that shone in the dark , night - sky . ( Odeen said the seven stars were seven suns that were very distant , and that there 126 were many other stars that were even more distant and were too dim to be seen . Tritt had heard him say that and had asked of what use it was for stars to exist if they could n't be seen and he did n't believe a word of it . Odeen had said , "
46706	46789	46704	46704	Tritt	157	" in a patient way . Dua had been about to say something very like that which Tritt had said , but changed her mind after that . ) It looked , now , as though there would be plenty of energy forever ; plenty of food — at least as soon as Estwald and the other Hard Ones learned to make the new energy taste right . It had only been a few days ago when she had said to Odeen , "
46821	46829	46805	46805	I	0	" Odeen looked puzzled for a moment . "
46845	46846	46847	46847	I	0	" "
46863	46870	46875	46875	Dua	134	" Odeen had said , happily , "
46893	47850	46875	46875	Dua	134	" And now Dua had been moving slowly , rather moodily , during all this time of reveries . Without particularly noting the passage of either time or space she found herself in the Hard - caverns and was just beginning to wonder if she had really delayed all she safely could and whether she might not turn home now and face the inevitable annoyance of Tritt when — almost as though the thought of Tritt had brought it about — she sensed Tritt . The sensation was so strong that there was only one confused moment in which she had thought that somehow she was picking up his feelings far away in the home cavern . No ! He was here , down here in the Hard - caverns with her . But what could he be doing here ? Was he pursuing her ? Was he going to quarrel with her here ? Was he foolishly going to appeal to the Hard Ones ? Dua did n't think she could endure that — And then the feeling of cold horror left her and was replaced 127 by astonishment . Tritt was not thinking of her at all . He had to be unaware of her presence . All she could sense about him was an overwhelming feeling of some sort of determination , mixed with fear and apprehension at something he would do . Dua might have penetrated farther and found out something , at least , about what it was he had done , and why , but nothing was further from her thoughts . Since Tritt did n't know she was in the vicinity , she wanted to make sure of only one thing — that he continued not to know . She did , then , almost in pure reflex , something that a moment before she would have sworn she would never dream of doing under any circumstances . Perhaps it was ( she later thought ) because of her idle reminiscences of that little - girl talk with Doral , or her memories of her own experiments with rock - rubbing . ( There was a complicated adult word for it but she found that word infinitely more embarrassing than the one all the children had used . ) In any case , without quite knowing what she was doing or , for a short while afterward , what she had done , she simply flowed hastily into the nearest wall . Into it ! Every bit of her ! The horror of what she had done was mitigated by the perfect manner in which it accomplished its purpose . Tritt passed by within almost touching distance and remained completely unaware that at one point he might have reached out and touched his mid - ling . By that time , Dua had no room to wonder what Tritt might be doing in the Hard - caverns if he had not come in pursuit of her . She forgot Tritt completely . What filled her instead was pure astonishment at her position . Even in childhood she had never melted completely into rock or met anyone who admitted she had ( though there were invariably tales of someone else who had ) . Certainly no adult Emotional ever had or could . Dua was unusually rarefied even for an Emotional ( Odeen was fond of telling her that ) and her avoidance of food accentuated this ( as Tritt often said ) . 128 What she had just done indicated the extent of her rarefaction more than any amount of right - ling scolding and for a moment she was ashamed and sorry for Tritt . And then she was swept by a deeper shame . What if she were caught ? She , an adult — If a Hard One passed and lingered — She could not possibly bring herself to emerge if anyone were watching but how long could she stay within and what if they discovered her in the rock ? And even as she thought that , she sensed the Hard Ones and then — somehow — realized they were far away . She paused , strove to calm herself . The rock , permeating and surrounding her , lent a kind of grayness to her perception but did n't dim it . Instead , she sensed more sharply . She could still sense Tritt in his steady motion downward as sharply as though he were by her side , and she could sense the Hard Ones though they were a cavern complex away . She saw the Hard Ones , every single one of them , each in his place , and could sense their vibratory speech to the fullest detail , and even catch bits of what they were saying . She was sensing as she never had before and never dreamed she could . So , though she could now leave the rock , secure in the knowledge she was both alone and unobserved , she did not ; partly out of amazement , partly out of the curious exultation she felt at understanding and her desire to experience it further . Her sensitivity was such that she even knew why she was sensitive . Odeen had frequently remarked how well he understood something after a period of melting , even though he had not understood it at all before . There was something about the melted state that increased sensitivity incredibly ; more was absorbed ; more was used . It was because of the greater atomic density during melting , Odeen had said . Even though Dua was not sure what "
47854	47928	46875	46875	Dua	134	" meant , it came with melting and was n't this present situation rather like melting ? Had n't Dua melted with rock ? When the triad melted , all the sensitivity went to Odeen 's 129 benefit . The Rational absorbed it , gained understanding , and retained that understanding after separation . But now Dua was the only consciousness in the melt . It was herself and the rock . There was "
47932	48567	46875	46875	Dua	134	" ( surely ? ) with only herself to benefit . ( Was this why rock - rubbing was considered a perversion ? Was this why Emotionals were warned off ? Or was it just Dua because she was so rarefied ? Or because she was a Left - Em ? ) And then Dua stopped all speculation and just sensed — in fascination . She was only mechanically aware of Tritt returning , moving past her , passing in the direction back from which he had come . She was only mechanically aware — scarcely feeling the vaguest surprise — that Odeen , too , was coming up from the Hard - caverns . It was the Hard Ones she was sensing , only they , trying to make more out of her perceptions , trying to make the most out of them . It was a long time before she detached and flowed out of the rock . And when that time came , she was not concerned overmuch as to whether she would be observed . She was confident enough of her sensing ability to know she would n't be . And she returned home deep in thought . 3b Odeen had returned home to find Tritt waiting for him , but Dua still had n't returned . Tritt did not seem disturbed at that . Or at least he seemed disturbed , but not at that . His emotions were strong enough so that Odeen could sense them clearly , but he let them go without proving . It was Dua 's absence that made Odeen restless ; to the extent that he found himself annoyed at Tritt 's presence simply because Tritt was not Dua . In this he surprised himself . He could not deny to himself that it was Tritt who , of the two , was the dearer to him . 130 Ideally , all members of the triad were one , and any member should treat the other two exactly on a par — both with each other and with him ( her ) self . Yet Odeen had never met a triad in which this was so ; least of all among those who loudly proclaimed their triad to be ideal in this respect . One of the three was always a little left out , and generally knew it , too . It was rarely the Emotional , though . They supported each other cross - triad to an extent that Rationals and Parentals never did . The Rational had his teacher , the proverb went , and the Parental his children — but the Emotional had all the other Emotionals . Emotionals compared notes and if one claimed neglect , or could be made to claim it , she was sent back with a thin patter of instructions to stand firm , to demand ! And because melting depended so much on the Emotional and her attitude , she was usually pampered by both left and right . But Dua was so non - Emotional an Emotional ! She did n't seem to care that Odeen and Tritt were so close , and she had no close friendships among the Emotionals to make her care . Of course that was it ; she was so non - Emotional an Emotional . Odeen loved having her so interested in his work ; loved having her so concerned and so amazingly ready of comprehension ; but that was an intellectual love . The deeper feeling went to steady , stupid Tritt , who knew his place so well and who could offer so little other than exactly what counted — the security of assured routine . But now Odeen felt petulant . He said , "
48576	48587	48572	48572	Dua	134	" And Tritt did not answer directly . He said , "
48604	48605	48598	48598	I	0	" "
48628	48641	48642	48643	The children	1906	" A note of annoyance made itself plain in Tritt 's voice . "
48669	48676	48667	48667	babies	2032	" But he did not deny the "
48680	48688	48689	48689	I	0	" aura that he faintly exuded . 131 "
48701	48702	48703	48703	You	131	" "
48710	48714	48715	48715	You	131	" Tritt said . "
48729	49043	48724	48724	You	131	" And he went on into the deeper recesses of the home cavern . Odeen looked after his right - ling with some surprise . At almost any other occasion he would have followed in an attempt to probe the unusual uneasiness that was making itself quite evident through the ingrained stolidity of a Parental . What had Tritt done ? — But he was waiting for Dua , and growing more anxious by the moment , and he let Tritt go . Anxiety keened Odeen 's sensitivity . There was almost a perverse pride among Rationals in their relative poverty of perception . Such perception was n't a thing of the mind ; it was most characteristic of Emotionals . Odeen was a Rational of Rationals , proud of reasoning rather than feeling , yet now he flung out the imperfect net of his emotional perception as far as he could ; and wished , for just a moment , that he were an Emotional so that he could send it out farther and better . Yet it eventually served his purpose . He could detect Dua 's approach , finally , at an unusual distance — for him — and he hastened out to meet her . And because he made her out at such a distance , he was more aware of her rarefaction than he ordinarily was . She was a delicate mist , no more . — Tritt was right , Odeen thought with sudden , sharp concern . Dua must be made to eat and to melt . Her interest in life must be increased . He was so intent on the necessity of this that when she flung herself flowingly toward him and virtually engulfed him , in utter disregard of the fact that they were not in private and might be observed , and said , "
49056	49097	49046	49046	I	0	" he accepted it as the completion of his own thought and did not even consider it strange . Carefully , he slipped away , trying to adopt a more seemly union without making it seem he was repulsing her . "
49100	49104	49105	49105	I	0	" he said , "
49127	49153	49120	49120	I	0	" 132 They were moving quickly homeward now , with Odeen adapting himself eagerly to the characteristic waver of the Emotional flow . Dua said , "
49177	49302	49120	49120	I	0	" It did not occur to Dua she was asking too much . It did occur to Odeen . He felt rich with an astonishing quantity of knowledge and was on the point of asking , How do you come to know enough about the other Universe to grow so curious about it ? He repressed the question . Dua was coming from the direction of the Hard - caverns . Perhaps Losten had been talking to her , suspecting that despite everything Odeen would be too proud of his status to help his mid - ling . Not so , thought Odeen gravely . And he would not ask . He would just explain . Tritt bustled about them when they returned home . "
49346	49403	49406	49406	Tritt	157	" Neither Odeen nor Dua had any thought of melting , but there was no thought in either mind of disobeying the command . The Parental 's home was his castle . The Rational had his Hardcaverns below and the Emotional her meeting places above . The Parental had only his home . Odeen therefore said , "
49416	49429	49408	49408	We	769	" And Dua extended a briefly loving part of herself and said , "
49441	49583	49408	49408	We	769	" ( Odeen wondered if her gesture were part relief over the fact that there would be no pressure to melt . Tritt did tend to overdo that a bit ; even more than Parentals generally . ) In her chamber , Dua stared at her private feeding - place . Ordinarily , she ignored it . It had been Odeen 's idea . He knew that such things did exist and , as he explained to Tritt , if Dua did not like to swarm with the other Emotionals , it was perfectly possible to * 33 lead Solar energy down into the cavern so that Dua might feed there . Tritt had been horrified . It was n't done . The others would laugh . The triad would be disgraced . Why did n't Dua behave as she should ? "
49588	49593	49586	49586	Tritt	157	" Odeen had said , "
49639	49704	49705	49705	Tritt	157	" Tritt allowed it , and even Dua allowed it — after some argument — but insisted that it be a simple design . So there was nothing but the two rods that served as electrodes , powered by Solar energy , and with room for Dua in between . Dua rarely used it , but this time she stared at it and said , "
49719	49720	49721	49721	I	0	" "
49727	49743	49748	49748	his	157	" A pattern of colored - clay designs was at the base of each electrode . "
49759	49763	49748	49748	his	157	" Dua said , "
49787	49788	49785	49785	he	157	" "
49791	49797	49798	49798	Tritt	157	" said Odeen , gravely . "
49816	49820	49804	49804	he	157	" Dua said , "
49827	50005	49823	49823	I	0	" Odeen caught a trace of guilt in her . Guilt over Tritt ? Over being hungry ? Why should Dua feel guilty about being hungry ? Or had she done something that had consumed energy and was she feeling — He wrenched his mind away from that impatiently . There were times when a Rational could be too Rational , and chase down the tracks of every thought to the detriment of what was important . Right now , it was important to talk to Dua . She seated herself between the electrodes and when she compressed herself to do so , her small size was only too painfully evident . Odeen was hungry himself ; he could tell because the electrodes seemed brighter than they ordinarily did ; and he could taste the food even at that distance and the savor was delicious . x34 When one was hungry , one always tasted food more keenly than otherwise and at a greater distance . . . . But he would eat later . Dua said , "
50024	50057	50058	50058	I	0	" She had adopted ( unconsciously ? ) the ovoid character of a Rational , as though to make it clearer that she wanted to be accepted as one . Odeen said , "
50136	50137	50109	50109	You	775	" "
50142	50146	50109	50109	You	775	" said Dua . "
50154	50155	50109	50109	You	775	" "
50271	50272	50267	50267	you	775	" "
50278	50282	50267	50267	you	775	" said Dua . "
50372	50373	50374	50374	You	775	" "
50384	50385	50374	50374	You	775	" "
50396	50409	50393	50393	I	0	" said Odeen , puzzled as to how to make matter clearer . "
50501	50516	50481	50482	Soft Ones	145	" Dua did n't look at all certain about that . Odeen hastened onward . "
50547	50548	50481	50482	Soft Ones	145	" "
50551	50557	50481	50482	Soft Ones	145	" Odeen shook his head , "
50610	50611	50604	50604	they	779	" "
50619	50620	50604	50604	they	779	" "
50691	50692	50682	50682	You	783	" "
50738	50739	50728	50728	they	767	" "
50748	50797	50746	50746	Dua	134	" Odeen was enjoying his role as teacher more intensely than usual now that he had official encouragement to speak . ( Earlier he always had the feeling that there was a kind of sneaking perversion in trying to explain things to an Emotional . ) He said , "
50847	50848	50841	50841	We	776	" "
50858	50859	50850	50850	they	767	" "
50976	50977	50978	50978	We	776	" "
50983	50991	50992	50992	I	0	" began Dua . Then she said , "
50995	51019	50992	50992	I	0	" Odeen smiled indulgently . It was so easy to forget the uncounted stars that could not be seen except by special instruments . "
51036	51037	51025	51025	You	794	" "
51044	51048	51038	51038	You	0	" said Dua . "
51061	51096	51038	51038	You	0	" And she wavered between the electrodes with a kind of luxurious tremor . Odeen , who had never before heard Dua say anything complimentary about food , was greatly heartened . He said , "
51125	51126	51038	51038	You	0	" "
51135	51136	51038	51038	You	0	" "
51207	51215	51216	51216	I	0	" He added , with some reluctance , "
51243	51244	51232	51232	I	0	" "
51253	51254	51232	51232	I	0	" "
51261	51265	51232	51232	I	0	" Dua said , "
51309	51310	51296	51296	We	776	" "
51315	51316	51296	51296	We	776	" "
51334	51335	51323	51323	I	0	" "
51338	51342	51323	51323	I	0	" said Odeen . "
51411	51412	51421	51421	I	0	" "
51450	51451	51421	51421	I	0	" "
51513	51514	51618	51622	a good left - ling	802	" "
51526	51604	51618	51622	a good left - ling	802	" Dua 's words were beginning to slur . She wriggled between her electrodes and to Odeen 's gratified eyes she seemed noticeably larger and compacter . It was as though his words , as well as the food , were nourishing her . Losten was right ! Education made her more nearly satisfied with life ; Odeen could sense a kind of sensual joy in Dua that he had scarcely ever felt before . She said , "
51624	51625	51618	51622	a good left - ling	802	" "
51634	51648	51627	51627	you	803	" asked Odeen , flattered and more pleased than he could easily say . "
51658	51659	51664	51664	Odeen	131	" "
51690	52049	51682	51682	you	131	" Odeen guessed at once , but was too cautious to say it openly . Dua 's moments of erotic advance were too few to treat with anything but care . He hoped desperately that Tritt had not involved himself with the children to the point where they could not take advantage of this . But Tritt was in the chamber already . Had he been outside the door , waiting ? He did not care . There was no time to think . Dua had flowed out from between the electrodes and 138 Odeen 's senses were filled with her beauty . She was between them , now , and through her Tritt shimmered , with his outlines flaming in incredible color . It had never been like this . Never . Odeen held himself back desperately , letting his own substance flow through Dua and into Tritt an atom at a time ; holding away from the overpowering penetrance of Dua with every bit of strength ; not giving himself up to the ecstasy , but letting it be wrenched from him ; hanging on to his consciousness to the last possible moment ; and then blanking out in one final transport so intense as to feel like an explosion echoing and reverberating endlessly within him . Never in the lifetime of the triad had the period of meltunconsciousness lasted so long . 3c Tritt was pleased . The melting had been so satisfactory . All previous occasions seemed skimpy and hollow in comparison . He was utterly delighted with what had happened . Yet he kept quiet . He felt it better not to speak . Odeen and Dua were happy , too . Tritt could tell . Even the children seemed to be glowing . But Tritt was happiest of all — naturally . He listened to Odeen and Dua talk . He understood none of it , but that did n't matter . He did n't mind that they seemed so pleased with each other . He had his own pleasure and was content to listen . Dua said , on one occasion . "
52060	52069	52070	52070	they	804	" ( Tritt never got it quite clear who "
52071	52078	52165	52165	they	1978	" might be . He gathered that "
52080	52086	52070	52070	they	804	" was a fancy word for "
52089	52096	52070	52070	they	804	" So why did n't they say "
52098	52121	52124	52124	Tritt	157	" ? Sometimes he wondered if he should * 39 interrupt . But if he asked questions , Odeen would only say , "
52126	52134	52124	52124	Tritt	157	" and Dua would swirl impatiently . ) "
52139	52143	52124	52124	Tritt	157	" said Odeen . "
52212	52213	52214	52214	I	0	" "
52234	52235	52231	52231	you	0	" "
52270	52271	52265	52265	We	805	" "
52281	52282	52274	52274	they	804	" "
52303	52308	52298	52298	we	805	" Dua seemed aggrieved . "
52316	52317	52318	52318	I	0	" "
52358	52359	52334	52334	Losten	142	" "
52370	52376	52361	52361	he	142	" Odeen said , huffily . "
52383	52384	52377	52377	I	0	" "
52404	52692	52393	52393	He	142	" By that time Tritt could no longer listen . They went on arguing for quite awhile over whether the Hard Ones should let Dua look at the markings or not . Dua said that she could sense what they said , perhaps . It made Tritt a little angry . After all , Dua was only a Soft One and not even a Rational . He began to wonder if Odeen was right to tell her all he did . It gave Dua funny ideas — Dua could see it made Odeen angry , too . First he laughed . Then he said that an Emotional could n't handle such complicated things . Then he refused to talk at all . Dua had to be very pleasant to him for a while till he came around . On one occasion it was Dua who was angry — absolutely furious . 140 It began quietly . In fact , it was on one of the occasions when the two children were with them . Odeen was letting them play with him . He did n't even mind when little - right Torun pulled at him . In fact , he let himself go in most undignified fashion . He did n't seem to mind that he was all out of shape . It was a sure sign he was pleased . Tritt remained in a corner , resting , and was so satisfied with what was happening . Dua laughed at Odeen 's misshapenness . She let her own substance touch Odeen 's knobbishness flirtatiously . She knew very well , Tritt knew , that the leftish surface was sensitive when out of ovoid . Dua said , "
52731	52752	52753	52753	I	0	" Odeen howled at Dua 's touch and tried to avoid her without upsetting the little ones . He gasped , "
52767	52775	52761	52761	you	0	" She stopped , and he said , "
52817	52873	52815	52815	you	0	" But they scurried off by themselves . They were not such little ones . They were quite grown . Annis would soon be starting his education and Torun was quite Parentally - blockish already . Tritt stayed and thought Dua looked very beautiful when Odeen talked to her in this way . Dua said , "
52900	52901	52905	52905	Dua	134	" "
52914	52915	52907	52908	A Rational	1912	" "
52923	52924	52907	52908	A Rational	1912	" "
52937	52941	52907	52908	A Rational	1912	" Dua said , "
52955	52956	52946	52946	I	0	" "
53047	53048	53061	53062	What people	819	" "
53059	53060	53061	53062	What people	819	" "
53064	53065	53061	53062	What people	819	" "
53073	53086	53061	53062	What people	819	" For a moment , Odeen looked blank , then he said , "
53092	53093	53061	53062	What people	819	" "
53105	53106	53061	53062	What people	819	" "
53112	53141	53061	53062	What people	819	" ( Tritt wondered what all the excitement was about . How could a Sun explode ? Dua seemed angrier and Odeen looked confused . ) Dua said , "
53153	53154	53155	53155	I	0	" "
53159	53161	53155	53155	I	0	" ' "
53169	53179	53155	53155	I	0	" Odeen hesitated and then said in clear annoyance , "
53201	53202	53203	53203	You	134	" "
53236	53242	53243	53243	I	0	" Odeen stared at her . "
53249	53250	53243	53243	I	0	" "
53255	53259	53251	53251	I	0	" Odeen said , "
53269	53293	53267	53267	Dua	134	" But Dua was shouting now . She was quite beside herself . Tritt had never seen her like that . She said , "
53386	53394	53380	53380	you	134	" Odeen was shouting too , now . "
53486	53563	53564	53564	Odeen	131	" They were almost touching now . Tritt was horrified . He had better say something , make them get apart , talk to them . He could n't think of anything to say . Then it turned out he did n't have to . There was a Hard One just outside the cavern . No , three of them . They had been trying to talk and had n't made themselves heard . Tritt shrieked , "
53568	53613	53564	53564	Odeen	131	" Then he remained quiet , trembling . He had a frightened notion of what the Hard Ones had come to talk about . He decided to leave . But a Hard One put out one of his permanent , opaque appendages and said , "
53618	53897	53564	53564	Odeen	131	" It sounded harsh , unfriendly . Tritt was more frightened than ever . 4a Dua was filled with anger ; so filled she could scarcely sense the Hard Ones . She seemed stifled under the components of the anger , each one filling her to the brim , separately . There was a sense of wrongness that Odeen should try to lie to her . A sense of wrongness that a whole world of people should die . A sense of wrongness that it was so easy for her to learn and that she had never been allowed to . Since that first time in the rock , she had gone twice more to the Hard - caverns . Twice more , unnoticed , she had buried herself in rock , and each time she sensed and knew , and each time when H3 Odeen would explain matters to her , she knew in advance what it was he would explain . Why could n't they teach her , then , as they had taught Odeen ? Why only the Rationals ? Did she possess the capacity to learn only because she was a Left - Em , a perverted mid - ling ? Then let them teach her , perversion and all . It was wrong to leave her ignorant . Finally , the words of the Hard One were breaking through to her . Losten was there , but it was not he speaking . It was a strange Hard One , in front , who spoke . She did not know him , but she knew few of them . The Hard One said , "
53914	53947	53948	53948	I	0	" Dua was defiant . They found out about her rock - rubbing and she did n't care . Let them tell everybody . She would do so herself . She said , "
53954	53955	53948	53948	I	0	" "
53958	53965	53948	53948	I	0	" said the Hard One calmly . "
53971	53990	53991	53991	I	0	" snapped Dua . It was only three times , but she did n't care . Odeen muttered , "
54005	54023	53991	53991	I	0	" The Hard One seemed to ignore that . He turned to Tritt instead and said sharply . "
54029	54033	54025	54025	you	0	" Tritt quavered , "
54040	54041	54025	54025	you	0	" "
54044	54045	54048	54050	Hard - sir	556	" "
54052	54053	54048	54050	Hard - sir	556	" "
54057	54058	54048	54050	Hard - sir	556	" "
54061	54092	54048	54050	Hard - sir	556	" Dua was annoyed . Poor Tritt was in such a panic over nothing . It was she herself who had done it and she was ready for a confrontation . "
54097	54101	54048	54050	Hard - sir	556	" she said . "
54109	54118	54102	54102	I	0	" The Hard One turned slowly toward her . "
54122	54126	54102	54102	I	0	" he said . "
54133	54161	54102	54102	I	0	" And faced with it directly , she could n't bring herself to describe what she had done after all . Not in front of Odeen . 144 "
54197	54198	54189	54189	you	556	" "
54212	54221	54208	54210	Hard - sir	556	" At which again Dua interrupted , eagerly , "
54226	54233	54223	54223	you	152	" The Hard One said briefiy , "
54236	54267	54223	54223	you	152	" Odeen looked annoyed , as though it embarrassed him that Dua did n't recognize the Hard One . Dua did n't care . The Hard One said to Tritt , "
54277	54290	54270	54270	you	556	" Tritt was silent . The Hard One said , without emotion , "
54314	54328	54297	54297	We	839	" Tritt was still silent , and Losten interposed , saying more kindly , "
54352	54356	54357	54357	I	0	" Tritt mumbled . "
54364	54365	54357	54357	I	0	" "
54368	54377	54357	54357	I	0	" It was the first Hard One speaking . "
54385	54391	54380	54380	you	556	" And Tritt burst out . "
54407	54424	54405	54405	Dua	134	" Dua jumped and coalesced in astonishment . The Hard One turned on her at once . "
54432	54433	54425	54425	You	556	" "
54436	54437	54425	54425	You	556	" "
54439	54453	54456	54458	Hard - sir	556	you?"—to Odeen . Odeen , so motionless as to seem frozen , said , "
54460	54808	54456	54458	Hard - sir	556	" For a moment the air was full of unpleasant vibration as the Hard Ones spoke to each other , ignoring the triad . Whether her sessions at rock - rubbing had made her more sensitive , or whether it was her recent storm of emotions , Dua could n't tell , and would n't have dreamed of trying to analyze ; she simply knew she was catching whiffs — not of words — but of understanding — They had detected the loss some time ago . They had been searching quietly . They had turned to the Soft Ones as possible M5 culprits with reluctance . They had investigated and then turned to Odeen 's triad with even greater reluctance . ( Why ? Dua missed that . ) They did not see how Odeen could have had the foolishness to take it , or Dua the inclination . They did not think of Tritt at all . Then the Hard One who had so far not said a word to the Soft Ones recalled seeing Tritt in the Hard - caverns . ( Of course , thought Dua . It was the day she had first entered the rock . She had sensed him then . She had forgotten . ) It had seemed unlikely in the extreme , but finally , with all else impossible and with the time lapse having grown intolerably dangerous , they came . They would have liked to consult Estwald , but by the time the possibility of Tritt arose , he was unavailable . All this Dua sensed in a gasp and now she turned toward Tritt , with a feeling of mingled wonder and outrage . Losten was anxiously vibrating that no harm had been done , that Dua looked well , that it was a useful experiment actually . The Hard One to whom Tritt had spoken was agreeing ; the other still exuded concern . Dua was not paying attention to them only . She was looking at Tritt . The first Hard One said , "
54819	54841	54817	54817	Tritt	157	" Tritt showed them . It was hidden effectively and the connections were clumsy but serviceable . The Hard One said , "
54850	54851	54843	54843	you	157	" "
54858	54859	54843	54843	you	157	" "
54866	54867	54862	54862	you	157	" "
54893	54894	54881	54881	I	0	" "
54908	54909	54910	54910	I	0	" "
54920	54934	54918	54918	I	0	" Tritt seemed unable to speak for a moment . Then he said , "
54989	55003	55004	55004	She	843	" He paused , then said in a huge , 146 tumultuous cry . "
55044	55139	55035	55038	A baby - Emotional	588	" Dua could not speak . She stumbled back and then rushed for the door in so pell - mell a fashion that the Hard Ones could not get out of the way in time . She struck the appendage of the one in front , passing deep into it , and then pulled free with a harsh sound . The Hard One 's appendage fell limp and his expression seemed contorted with pain . Odeen tried to dodge around him to follow Dua , but the Hard One said , with apparent difficulty , "
55157	55286	55289	55289	you	848	" 4b Odeen found himself living through a nightmare . Dua was gone . The Hard Ones were gone . Only Tritt was still there ; silent . How could it have happened , Odeen thought in tortured fashion . How could Tritt have found his way alone to the Hardcaverns ? How could he have taken a storage battery charged at the Positron Pump and designed to yield radiation in much more concentrated form than Sunlight and dared — Odeen would not have had the courage to chance it . How could Tritt ; stumbling , ignorant Tritt ? Or was he unusual , too ? Odeen , the clever Rational ; Dua , the curious Emotional ; and Tritt , the daring Parental ? He said , "
55295	55300	55289	55289	you	848	" Tritt retorted hotly . "
55351	55353	55357	55357	you	848	" H7 "
55390	55505	55506	55506	Odeen	131	" I do n't understand what you 're saying , Odeen . How could it do harm ? I tasted the kind of food the Hard Ones made before . It tasted bad . You 've tasted it , too . It tasted just awful and it never hurt us . It tasted so bad , Dua would n't touch it . Then I came on the food - ball . It tasted good . I ate some and it was delicious . How can anything delicious hurt . You see , Dua ate it . She liked it . And it started the baby - Emotional . How can I have done wrong ? "
55514	55523	55511	55511	He	131	" Dua is going to be very angry . "
55524	55531	55587	55587	he	157	" She 'll get over it . "
55532	55576	55577	55577	Tritt	157	" I wonder . Tritt , she 's not like ordinary Emotionals . That 's what makes her so hard to live with , but so wonderful when we can live with her . She may never want to melt with us again . "
55590	55597	55587	55587	he	157	" Well , what of it ? "
55598	55614	55587	55587	he	157	" What of it ? You ask . Do you want to give up melting ? "
55615	55672	55587	55587	he	157	" No , but if she wo n't she wo n't . I have my third baby and I do n't care any more . I know all about the Soft Ones in the old days . They used to have two triad - births sometimes . But I do n't care . One is plenty . "
55673	55687	55587	55587	he	157	" But , Tritt , babies are n't all there is to melting . "
55688	55719	55720	55720	Odeen	131	" What else ? I heard you say once you learned faster after you melted . Then learn slower . I do n't care . I have my third baby . "
55919	55923	55931	55931	He	157	" passing on . "
56810	56813	56814	56814	she	134	" Betrayed , "
56819	56822	56814	56814	she	134	" Betrayed ! "
57810	57813	57814	57814	he	131	" Dua , "
57819	57826	57814	57814	he	131	" are n't you coming home ? "
57827	57835	57836	57836	she	134	" I have no home , Odeen , "
57855	57877	57814	57814	he	131	" How can you blame Tritt for what he did , Dua ? You know the poor fellow ca n't reason . "
57878	57921	57814	57814	he	131	" But you can , Odeen . And you occupied my mind while he arranged to feed my body , did n't you ? Your reason told you that I was much more likely to be trapped by you than by him . "
57922	57926	57814	57814	he	131	" Dua , nol "
57927	57947	57814	57814	he	131	" No , what ? Did n't you make a big show of teaching me , of educating me . "
57948	57983	57814	57814	he	131	" I did , but it was n't a show , it was real . And it was not because of what Tritt had done . I did n't know what Tritt had done . "
57984	57991	57992	57992	She	906	" I ca n't believe that . "
58020	58038	58015	58015	She	906	" Let me ask you one question , Odeen ? Why did you want to teach me ? "
58042	58066	58015	58015	She	906	" Because I wanted to . Because I enjoy teaching and because I would rather teach than do anything else — but learn . "
58067	58080	58081	58081	she	906	" And melt , of course . . . . Never mind , "
58088	58137	58081	58081	she	906	" Do n't explain that you are talking of reason and not of instinct . If you really mean what you say about enjoying teaching ; if I can really ever believe what you say ; then perhaps you can understand something I 'm going to tell you . "
58233	58236	58215	58215	Tritt	157	" * 54 "
58241	58312	58215	58215	Tritt	157	" asked Odeen . He was prepared to listen for as long as might be necessary , and as quietly , if only she would come back with him when she had said her say . He would perform any penance , do anything that might be required . Only she must come back — and something dim and dark inside him knew that she had to come back voluntarily . "
58325	58333	58323	58323	Odeen	131	" she said lightly , almost laughing . "
58406	58407	58399	58399	they	1978	" "
58416	58428	58431	58431	Odeen	131	" said Odeen , nonplused . Dua 's voice grew harsher . "
58582	58583	58575	58575	you	131	" "
58586	58600	58601	58601	They	140	" There was a kind of fascination about this . A repulsive fascination . "
58762	58765	58775	58775	Emotionals	137	" passing on "
58801	58802	58809	58809	Dua	134	" "
58811	58918	58809	58809	Dua	134	" Odeen managed to say . He had no arguments to pose against her nightmare scheme , but he knew with a certainty past argument that she was wrong . ( Or did a little pang of doubt deep inside suggest that the certainty might have been implanted in him , to begin with?—No , surely no , for then would not Dua be certain with an implanted certainty , too , that this was wrong?—Or was she an imperfect Emotional without the proper implantations and without — Oh , what was he thinking . He was as crazy as she was . ) Dua said , "
59001	59002	58991	58991	I	0	" "
59007	59021	59005	59005	Dua	134	" said Odeen , strenuously , as much to himself as to her . "
59046	59047	59041	59041	We	928	" "
59169	59205	59162	59164	the Hard Ones	140	" Odeen felt wild . Dua must surely be mad , yet he dared not say so . He had to cajole her somehow and bring her back . He said 156 with strenuous sincerity , "
59217	59218	59162	59164	the Hard Ones	140	" "
59226	59227	59228	59228	I	0	" "
59262	59266	59235	59235	I	0	" Dua laughed . "
59281	59282	59274	59276	the Hard Ones	140	" "
59314	59318	59301	59301	I	0	" Dua said , "
59336	59358	59362	59362	Dua	134	" She flowed away once more , thinly . There was an air of weariness about her . Odeen called out , "
59375	59385	59365	59365	you	134	" She did not answer . He cried out . "
59392	59561	59365	59365	you	134	" She did not answer . And he followed no more , but looked after her in deepest misery as she dwindled . He did not tell Tritt he had seen Dua . What was the use ? Nor did he see her again . He began haunting the favored sunningsites of the Emotionals of the region ; doing so even though occasional Parentals emerged to watch him in stupid suspicion ( Tritt was a mental giant compared to most Parentals ) . The lack of her hurt more with each passing day . And with each passing day , he realized that there was a gathering fright inside himself over her absence . He did n't know why . He came back to home - cavern one day to find Losten waiting for him . Losten was standing there , grave and polite while Tritt was showing him the new baby and striving to keep the handful of mist from touching the Hard One . Losten said , "
59575	59576	59568	59568	Tritt	157	" "
59579	59583	59568	59568	Tritt	157	" corrected Tritt . "
59600	59601	59594	59594	He	131	" "
59608	59614	59615	59615	Tritt	157	" said Odeen , hastily . "
59628	59646	59624	59626	a good fellow	939	" 157 Tritt did so , and Losten turned to Odeen with quite obvious relief , saying , "
59658	59756	59647	59647	You	0	" Odeen tried to answer with some polite inconsequence , but could maintain only a miserable silence . He had recently been developing a kind of comradeship , a vague sense of equality with the Hard Ones , that enabled them to talk together on a level . Somehow Dua 's madness had spoiled it . Odeen knew she was wrong and yet he approached Losten once more as stiffly as in the long - gone days when he thought of himself as a far inferior creature to them , as a — machine ? Losten said , "
59762	59778	59760	59760	Dua	134	" This was a real question , and not politeness . Odeen could tell easily . "
59784	59789	59782	59782	H	168	" ( He almost said "
59793	59807	59811	59811	Losten	142	" as though he were a child again , or a Parental . ) "
59819	59820	59813	59813	She	134	" "
59826	59832	59813	59813	She	134	" said Losten , sofdy . "
59842	59848	59833	59833	I	0	" Losten regarded him somberly . "
59857	59892	59850	59850	you	0	" Odeen dared not look at the other . Had he discovered Dua 's wild theories ? What would be done about that ? He made a negative sign without speaking . Losten said , "
59910	59911	59908	59908	you	0	" "
59914	59918	59908	59908	you	0	" sighed Odeen . "
59984	59985	59987	59987	you	131	" "
59989	59990	59987	59987	you	131	" "
60077	60078	60079	60079	I	0	" "
60091	60096	60079	60079	I	0	" said Odeen miserably . "
60147	60148	60152	60152	she	134	" "
60176	60177	60166	60166	she	134	" "
60186	60193	60166	60166	she	134	" Losten hesitated , then said , "
60210	60228	60194	60194	She	134	" It took awhile for Odeen to grasp the clear meaning of the words . He said , "
60238	60239	60240	60240	She	134	" "
60305	60306	60271	60271	She	134	" "
60313	60328	60271	60271	She	134	" Odeen rocked back and forth , his surface opaque with shame and grief . "
60336	60342	60330	60330	Estwald	152	" Losten said , grimly , "
60352	60353	60330	60330	Estwald	152	" "
60363	60364	60357	60357	she	134	" "
60385	60386	60365	60365	She	134	" "
60398	60399	60400	60400	She	134	" "
60433	60451	60415	60415	She	134	" Odeen shivered . Out of control ? How machine - like a reference ! He said , "
60459	60460	60415	60415	She	134	" "
60504	60505	60471	60471	she	134	" "
60509	60510	60511	60511	She	134	" "
60518	60519	60516	60516	Odeen	131	" "
60532	60584	60527	60527	you	0	" His voice failed . Dimly , he knew that the Hard One had devices for digging caverns out of the world 's rock ; devices scarcely used since the world 's population had begun declining ages ago . Would they locate Dua in the rock and blast it and her ? "
60587	60593	60527	60527	you	0	" said Losten , forcefully . "
60600	60601	60602	60602	Estwald	152	" "
60605	60606	60607	60607	Estwald	152	" "
60615	60616	60607	60607	Estwald	152	" "
60624	60625	60607	60607	Estwald	152	" "
60646	60647	60644	60644	you	131	" "
60657	60658	60654	60654	I	0	" "
60663	60669	60654	60654	I	0	" said Losten , urgently . "
60674	60675	60654	60654	I	0	" "
60680	60681	60682	60682	I	0	" "
60690	60698	60682	60682	I	0	" said Losten , in apparent agony . "
60707	60875	60894	60894	he	142	" He turned and left , moving rapidly for a Hard One , moving as though he did not trust himself to stay and perhaps say too much . And Odeen could only look after him , dismayed , confused — lost . 5c There was a great deal for Tritt to do . Babies required much care , but even two young - lefts and two young - rights together did not make up the sum of a single baby - mid — particularly not a mid as perfect as Derola . She had to be exercised and soothed , protected from percolating into whatever she touched , cajoled into condensing and resting . It was a long time before he saw Odeen again and , actually , 160 he did n't care . Derola took up all his time . But then he came across Odeen in the corner of his own alcove , iridescent with thought . Tritt remembered , suddenly . He said , "
60882	60891	60877	60877	Losten	142	" Odeen came to himself with a start . "
60904	60905	60906	60906	She	134	" "
60915	60922	60923	60923	Tritt	157	" Odeen was staring at Tritt . "
60925	60929	60923	60923	Tritt	157	" he said , "
60973	60974	60965	60965	You	157	" "
60977	60983	60965	60965	You	157	" said Tritt , shocked . "
61040	61041	61044	61044	Tritt	157	" "
61055	61056	61044	61044	Tritt	157	" "
61065	61066	61044	61044	Tritt	157	" "
61076	61080	61044	61044	Tritt	157	" Tritt said , "
61111	61112	61113	61115	The Hard Ones	1978	" "
61139	61170	61137	61137	Dua	134	" Tritt thought about that . He did n't care about Dua . He did n't even care about Odeen , somehow . There was only Derola . He said , "
61184	61185	61186	61186	Tritt	157	" "
61188	61194	61186	61186	Tritt	157	" said Odeen , urgently , "
61212	61213	61186	61186	Tritt	157	" "
61217	61221	61186	61186	Tritt	157	" said Tritt . "
61227	61260	61261	61261	Tritt	157	" Tritt was silent . There was nothing he could say . He had never heard of such a thing . He could not conceive of such a thing . Odeen said , "
61339	61345	61333	61333	Dua	134	" Tritt was backing away . "
61372	61373	61367	61367	You	131	" "
61382	61388	61374	61374	I	0	" said Odeen , sadly . "
61410	61411	61408	61408	Dua	134	" "
61416	61491	61408	61408	Dua	134	" Tritt was in agony , trying to resist . There was something terribly new about Odeen , and existence was approaching an end inexorably . There would be no Tritt and no baby - mid . Where every other Parental had his baby - mid for a long time , Tritt would have lost his almost at once . It was n't fair . Oh , it was n't fair . Tritt panted . "
61504	61512	61499	61499	her	134	" Odeen said , with deadening calm , "
61524	62684	61499	61499	her	134	" And Tritt knew that was so — that was so — that was so — 6a Dua felt thin and cold , wispy . Her attempts to rest in the open and absorb Sunlight had ended after Odeen had found her that time . Her feeding at the Hard Ones ' batteries was erratic . She dared not remain too long outside the safety of rock , so she ate in quick gulps , and she never got enough . She was conscious of hunger , continuously , all the more so since it seemed to tire her to remain in the rock . It was as though she were being punished for all that long time in which she haunted the Sunset and ate so skimpily . If it were not for the work she was doing , she could not bear the weariness and hunger . Sometimes she hoped that the Hard Ones would destroy her — but only after she was finished . The Hard Ones were helpless as long as she was in the rock . Sometimes she sensed them outside the rock in the open . They were afraid . Sometimes she thought the fear was for her , but that 162 could n't be . How could they be afraid for her ; afraid that she would pass on out of sheer lack of food , out of sheer exhaustion . It must be that they were afraid of her ; afraid of a machine that did not work as they had designed it to work ; appalled at so great a prodigy ; struck helpless with the terror of it . Carefully , she avoided them . She always knew where they were , so they could not catch her nor stop her . They could not watch all places always . She thought she could even blank what little perception they had . She swirled out of the rock and studied the recorded duplicates of the communications they had received from the other Universe . They did not know that was what she was after . If they hid them , she would find them in whatever new place . If they destroyed them , it did n't matter . Dua could remember them . She did not understand them , at first , but with her stay in the rocks , her senses grew steadily sharper , and she seemed to understand without understanding . Without knowing what the symbols meant , they inspired feelings within her . She picked out markings and placed them where they would be sent to the other Universe . The markings were F - E - E - R. What that could possibly mean she had no idea , but its shape inspired her with a feeling of fear and she did her best to impress that feeling of fear upon the markings . Perhaps the other - creatures , studying the markings , would also feel fear . When the answers came , Dua could sense excitement in them . She did not always get the answers that were sent . Sometimes the Hard Ones found them first . Surely , they must know what she was doing . Still , they could n't read the messages , could n't even sense the emotions that went along with them . So she did n't care . She would not be stopped , till she was done — whatever the Hard Ones found out . She waited for a message that would carry the feeling she wanted . It came : P - U - M - P B - A - D. It carried the fear and hatred she wanted . She sent it back in extended form — more fear — more hatred — Now the other people would understand . Now they would stop the Pump . The Hard Ones would have to find some other way , some other source of 163 energy ; they must not obtain it through the death of all those thousands of other Universe creatures . She was resting too much , declining into a kind of stupor , within the rock . Desperately she craved food and waited so that she could crawl out . Even more desperately than she wanted the food in a storage battery , she wanted that storage battery to be dead . She wanted to suck the last bit of food out of it and know that no more would come and that her task was done . She emerged at last and remained recklessly long , sucking in the contents of one of the batteries . She wanted to withdraw its last , empty it , see that no more was entering — but it was an endless source — endless — endless . She stirred and drew away from the battery in disgust . The Positron Pumps were still going then . Had her messages not persuaded the other Universe creatures to stop the Pumps ? Had they not received them ? Had they not sensed their meaning ? She had to try again . She had to make it plain beyond plain . She would include every combination of signals that to her seemed to carry the feeling of danger ; every combination that would get across the plea to stop . Desperately she began to fuse the symbols into metal ; drawing without reserve on the energy she had just sucked out of the battery ; drawing on it till it was all gone and she was more weary than ever : PUMP NOT STOP NOT STOP WE NOT STOP PUMP WE NOT HEAR DANGER NOT HEAR NOT HEAR YOU STOP PLEASE STOP YOU STOP SO WE STOP PLEASE YOU STOP DANGER DANGER DANGER DANGER STOP STOP YOU STOP PUMP . It was all she could do . There was nothing left in her but a racking pain . She placed the message where it could be transferred and she did not wait for the Hard Ones to send the message unwittingly . Through an agonizing haze , she manipulated the controls as she had seen them do , finding the energy for it somehow . The message disappeared and so did the cavern in a purple shimmer of vertigo . She was — passing on — out of sheer — exhaustion . Odeen — Tri — 164 6b Odeen came . He had been flowing faster than ever he had flowed before . He had been following Tritt 's sharp new - baby sense perception , but now he was close enough for his own blunter senses to detect her nearness . He could on his own account feel the flickering and fading consciousness of Dua , and he raced forward while Tritt did his best to clump along , gasping and calling , "
62689	62712	62713	62713	Tritt	157	" Odeen found her in a state of collapse , scarcely alive , smaller than he had ever seen an adult Emotional . "
62715	62719	62898	62898	Tritt	157	" he said , "
62751	62886	62745	62745	she	970	" The Hard Ones began to gather . They were late , of course , with their inability to sense other life - forms at a distance . If it had depended only on them , it would have been too late to save her . She would not have passed on ; she would truly have been destroyed — and — and more than she knew would have been destroyed with her . Now , as she was slowly gathering life out of the energy supply , the Hard Ones stood silently near them . Odeen rose ; a new Odeen who knew what was happening exactly . Imperiously , he ordered them away with an angry gesture — and they left . Silently . Without objection . Dua stirred . Tritt said , "
62894	62895	62892	62892	Odeen	131	" "
62900	62904	62905	62905	Dua	134	" said Odeen . "
62907	62908	62905	62905	Dua	134	" "
62911	62920	62909	62909	Odeen	131	" She stirred , spoke in a whisper . "
62928	62929	62921	62921	I	0	" "
62946	62947	62960	62960	Dua	134	" "
62954	62955	62949	62949	Tritt	157	" "
62962	62967	62960	62960	Dua	134	" said Tritt . 165 "
62976	62980	62960	62960	Dua	134	" said Dua . "
63031	63080	63017	63017	they	140	" Odeen did n't say anything . He kept Tritt from saying anything , either . He let the radiation pour slowly into Dua , very slowly . He stopped at times to let her rest a bit , then he started again . She began to mutter , "
63085	63106	63107	63107	Dua	134	" Her substance was writhing more strongly . Still he fed her . Finally , he spoke . He said , "
63167	63180	63153	63153	I	0	" Dua moaned and Odeen stopped for a while . He said , "
63274	63282	63271	63271	you	134	" Tritt said , in soft confusion , "
63287	63291	63295	63295	Tritt	157	" Odeen said , "
63312	63326	63310	63310	Dua	134	" He kept watching Dua , who was gaining opalescence . He said , "
63537	63551	63520	63520	I	0	" Dua was looking at him , trying to smile . She said , "
63583	63584	63585	63585	They	140	" "
63760	63842	63843	63843	Dua	134	" For it 's especially true in our case , Dua . For many generations , the Hard Ones have been combining triads with great care to form particularly advanced Hard Ones and our triad was the best they 'd ever obtained . Especially you , Dua . Especially you . Losten was once the triad whose baby - mid you were . Part of him was your Parental . He knew you . He brought you to Tritt and me . "
63853	63866	63847	63847	Her	134	" Odeen ! Are you making all this up to soothe me ? "
63871	63900	63867	63867	Tritt	157	" No , Dua . I feel it , too . I feel it , too . I do n't know what exactly , but I feel it . "
63901	63907	63909	63909	Odeen	131	" He does , Dua , "
63911	63947	63909	63909	Odeen	131	" You will , too . Are n't you beginning to recall being a Hard One during our melt ? Do n't you want to melt now ? One last time ? One last time ? "
63971	63981	63982	63982	she	134	" If what you say is true , Odeen , "
63985	64014	63982	63982	she	134	" If we are to be a Hard One ; then it seems to me you are saying we 'll be an important one . Is that so ? "
64015	64070	64071	64071	Dua	134	" The most important . The best who was ever formed . I mean that . . . . Tritt , over there . It 's not good - by , Tritt . We 'll be together , as we always wanted to be . Dua , too . You , too , Dua . "
64074	64091	64071	64071	Dua	134	" Then we can make Estwald understand the Pump ca n't continue . We 'll force — "
64239	64254	64237	64237	Dua	134	" No , we ca n't stop Estwald . We are Estwald . We — "
64310	64325	64291	64291	Estwald	152	" I am permanently with you now , and there is much to do — "
64370	64377	64378	64378	she	172	" It 's time for lunch , "
64383	64486	64378	64378	she	172	" All home - grown , ladies and gentlemen . You may not be used to the taste , but it 's all nourishing . . . . Right here , sir . You wo n't mind sitting with the ladies , I know . . . . One moment . There will be seats for all . . . . Sorry , there will be a choice on the beverage , but not on the main course . That will be veal . . . . No , no . Artificial flavor and texture , but it 's really quite good . "
64517	64522	64523	64523	he	998	" Do you mind ? "
64557	64572	64554	64554	She	172	" Not at all . But are n't you with someone in this group ? "
64578	64601	64575	64575	his	998	" No . I 'm alone . Even if that were not the case , Earthies are no great thrill to me . "
64647	64664	64644	64644	She	172	" ' Earthie ' is a Moon - expression , and not a very nice one . "
64665	64671	64672	64672	he	998	" I 'm from Earth , "
64675	64691	64672	64672	he	998	" so I can use it without offense , I hope . Unless you object . "
64818	64825	64815	64815	He	998	" Are there many Selenes here ? "
64826	64868	64815	64815	He	998	" Oh , yes . Hundreds , I think . Also Cynthias , Dianas , and Artemises . Selene is a little tiresome . Half the Selenes I know are called ' Silly ' and the other half ' Lena . ' "
64869	64874	64815	64815	He	998	" Which are you ? "
64875	64892	64893	64893	she	172	" Neither . I am Selene , all three syllables . SELL - uh - nee , "
64904	64915	64893	64893	she	172	" to those who use my first name at all . "
64942	64956	64939	64939	He	998	" And what if anyone asks you if you sell any , Selene ? "
64957	64965	64966	64966	she	172	" They never ask me that again ! "
64971	64978	64966	64966	she	172	" But do they ask you ? "
64979	64985	64986	64987	A waitress	1004	" There are fools always . "
65017	65026	65011	65011	He	998	" You make them seem to float down . "
65037	65058	65034	65034	Selene	172	" Do n't you try to do the same . She 's used to the gravity and can handle it . "
65059	65074	65011	65011	He	998	" And if I try , I 'll drop everything ? Is that it ? "
65075	65083	65084	65084	she	172	" You 'll make a gorgeous mess , "
65087	65095	65084	65084	she	172	" Well , I wo n't try . "
65096	65189	65190	65191	The Earthman	173	" There 's a good chance someone will before long , and the plate will flow down to the floor and they 'll grab for it and miss , and ten to one knock themselves out of their chair . I 'd warn 172 them , but it never helps and they 're just all the more embarrassed . Everyone else will laugh — the tourists , that is , because the rest of us have seen it too often to find it funny and because it 's just a cleanup job . "
65198	65212	65194	65194	his	173	" I see what you mean . Even the simplest motions seem queer . "
65213	65250	65190	65191	The Earthman	173	" Actually , you get used to it quickly enough . At least to little things like eating . Walking is harder . I never saw an Earthman run efficiently out here . Not really efficiently . "
65263	65271	65260	65260	he	173	" What does the L. stand for ? "
65283	65287	65280	65280	It	1010	" Selene Lindstrom L. "
65288	65294	65295	65295	she	1009	" It just means Luna , "
65301	65315	65295	65295	she	1009	" to distinguish me from the immigrants . I was bor n here . "
65316	65319	65280	65280	It	1010	" Really ? "
65320	65363	65280	65280	It	1010	" That 's nothing to be surprised about . We 've had a working society here for over half a century . Do n't you think babies are born here ? We have people here who were born here and are grandparents . "
65364	65370	65295	65295	she	1009	" How old are you ? "
65371	65376	65377	65377	she	1009	" Thirty - two , "
65387	65391	65380	65380	He	1011	" Of course . "
65397	65411	65394	65394	her	172	" You mean you understand ? Most Earthmen have to have it explained . "
65416	65479	65480	65480	Selene	172	" I know enough to know that most of the visible signs of aging are the result of the inexorable victory of gravity over tissue — the sagging of cheek and the drooping of breast . With the Moon 's gravity one - sixth that of Earth , it is n't really hard to understand that people will stay young - looking . "
65483	65519	65480	65480	Selene	172	" Only young - Zoofeing . It does n't mean we have immortality here . The life - span is about that of Earth , but most of us are more comfortable in old age . "
65520	65539	65540	65540	He	1011	" That 's not to be dismissed . ... Of course , there are penalties , I suppose . "
65551	65558	65559	65559	He	1011	" You have to drink this — "
65576	65586	65587	65587	she	172	" We could import food and beverages from Earth , "
65592	65649	65587	65587	she	172	" but only enough to feed a fraction of us a fraction of the time . There 'd be no point to that when we can use the space for more vital items . Besides , we 're used to this crud . . . . Or were you going to use a still stronger word . "
65650	65656	65657	65657	he	1011	" Not for the coffee , "
65660	65700	65657	65657	he	1011	" I was going to save that for the food . But crud will do . . . . Tell me , Miss Lindstrom . I did n't see any mention on the tour itinerary of the proton synchrotron . "
65701	65706	65707	65707	She	172	" The proton synchrotron ? "
65737	65750	65713	65713	her	172	" That 's Terrestrial property and it 's not open to tourists . "
65751	65763	65657	65657	he	1011	" You mean that it 's off - limits to Lunarites . "
65764	65798	65713	65713	her	172	" Oh , no . Nothing of the sort . Most of its staff are Lunarites . It 's just that it 's the Terrestrial government that sets the rules . No tourists . "
65799	65807	65808	65808	he	1014	" I 'd love to see it , "
65814	65847	65811	65811	She	172	" I 'm sure you would . . . . You 've brought me luck ; not one item of food , not one blessed man or woman has hit the floor . "
65856	65992	65848	65848	She	172	" Ladies and gentlemen , we 'll be leaving in about ten minutes . Please leave the plates where they are . There are rest rooms for those who wish to use them and then we will visit the food - processing plants where meals such as you have just eaten are made possible . 2 Selene 's quarters were small , of course , and compact ; but they were intricate . The windows were panoramic ; star scenes that changed slowly and very randomly , never having any relationship to any real constellation . Each of the three windows could be made to undergo telescopic magnification , when Selene so desired . * 74 Barron Neville hated that part of it . He would tend to turn it off rather savagely and say , "
66031	66042	66001	66026	the only one I know who has the bad taste to do such a thing . It 's not as though these nebulae and star clusters	1016	" And Selene would shrug , coolly , and say , "
66080	66106	66001	66026	the only one I know who has the bad taste to do such a thing . It 's not as though these nebulae and star clusters	1016	" Then Neville would mumble something and make a halfhearted attempt to restore the controls to where he had found them and Selene would say , "
66111	66148	66001	66026	the only one I know who has the bad taste to do such a thing . It 's not as though these nebulae and star clusters	1016	" The furniture was in smooth curves , and the walls were abstractly decorated in low - key , unobtrusive colors . Nowhere was there any representation of anything that might be considered a living thing . "
66154	66159	66001	66026	the only one I know who has the bad taste to do such a thing . It 's not as though these nebulae and star clusters	1016	" Selene would say , "
66164	66231	66001	66026	the only one I know who has the bad taste to do such a thing . It 's not as though these nebulae and star clusters	1016	" Now , when she entered , she found , as so often , Neville there ; Barron Neville , resting on the flimsy couch with one sandal on . The other lay beside him where it had dropped , and there was a line of red marks on his abdomen , just over his umbilicus , where he had been meditatively scratching . She said , "
66243	66281	66241	66241	Barron	182	" and slipped out of her own clothes in a long , graceful wiggle accompanied by a sigh of relief , letting them drop to the ground and then kicking them into the corner with one toe . "
66291	66295	66241	66241	Barron	182	" she said . "
66312	66334	66309	66310	an Earthie	1023	" Neville was in the kitchen corner . He paid no attention ; he had heard it before . He said , "
66348	66349	66309	66310	an Earthie	1023	" "
66353	66357	66309	66310	an Earthie	1023	" she asked . "

66447	66460	66442	66442	you	1024	" He brought the two small cups of coffee to the table . "
66508	66561	66505	66505	your	1024	" Barron shook his head . He was heavily - built for a Lunarite , and there was an almost - sullen narrowing of his eyes that had become a built - in feature . Except for that his features were even , and remarkably handsome , Selene thought . He said , "
66586	66587	66589	66589	he	183	" "
66593	66594	66589	66589	he	183	" "
66625	66645	66615	66615	You	1024	" But he looked uneasy just the same . Selene sipped at her coffee and looked at him shrewdly . "
66653	66654	66615	66615	You	1024	" "
66701	66702	66703	66703	They	1022	" "

66847	66865	66866	66866	They	1022	" She finished her own cup of coffee and stared at its emptiness thoughtfully . She said , "

66908	66914	66915	66915	I	0	" he said , briefly . "

67299	67322	67325	67325	he	1036	" Neville rose to his feet , swaying a little as was almost in- 177 evitable after quick movement at low gravity . "
67331	67332	67325	67325	he	1036	" "
67379	67380	67369	67370	No one	236	" "
67384	67398	67369	67370	No one	236	" He paused a little , then in a normal voice , said , "
67407	67411	67401	67401	he	1036	" Selene said , "
67459	67460	67464	67464	you	0	" "

67584	67609	67580	67580	he	1036	" He walked hastily to the other end of the room and back as though wearing off a little energy . Then he said , "
67625	67626	67627	67627	Sexually	184	" "
67629	67630	67627	67627	Sexually	184	" "
67644	67651	67642	67642	Selene	172	" Selene said with clear reluctance . "
67674	67675	67670	67670	He	1036	" "
67690	67691	67687	67687	him	1036	" "

67744	67748	67720	67720	You	172	" she said , "
67757	67844	67720	67720	You	172	" 178 3 There was no way of telling the Commissioner 's quarters , by size alone , from those of any Lunarite . There was no space on the Moon , not even for Terrestrial officials ; no luxurious waste , even as a symbol of the home planet . Nor , for that matter , was there any way of changing the overwhelming fact about the Moon — that it was underground at low gravity — even for the greatest Earthman who ever lived . "
67854	67859	67845	67845	Man	185	" sighed Luiz Montez . "
67928	68035	68036	68036	You	1052	" Konrad Gottstein was only thirty - four and looked , if anything , younger . He had a wide , round , large - featured face , the kind of face one did n't see among the Lunarites , the kind of face that was something they would draw as part of an Earthie caricature . He was not heavily - built — it did not pay to send heavily - built Earthmen to the Moon — and his head seemed too large for his body . He said ( and he spoke Planetary Standard with a perceptibly different accent from that of Montez ) , "

68048	68077	68045	68045	I	0	" said Montez . Where Gottstein 's face was intrinsically good - natured in appearance , the long thin lines of Montez ' face were almost comically tragic . "

69118	69156	69110	69110	Thy	1079	" He stumbled a bit in trying to say this , since he rarely used second person singular in Planetary Standard . Montez smiled more broadly , and then let it vanish . He shook his head . "
69221	69242	69210	69210	I	0	" He seemed serious , his hand on the other 's shoulder , his eyes looking straight into Gottstein 's . "

69286	69320	69267	69267	I	0	" Gottstein put away the Earth - can at once . There was no way in which his face could match the other 's seriousness , but his voice was grave and steady . "

72515	72587	72483	72483	you	0	" that lay about for the taking in most sections of the Lunar surface . She wore sandals which scarcely seemed to touch the ground ; he wore thick - soled boots which leadenly helped weigh him down to keep his steps from becoming torture . The corridor was one - way . Occasionally , a small electric cart would overtake them and move nearly silently past . The Earthman said , "

72935	72997	73440	73441	the Earthman	1003	" Barron 's interest . He 's busy now and there 's no harm in entertaining you until he 's ready . . . . Besides , it 's different . Ca n't you see it 's different ? On my job I 'm riding herd on a couple of dozen Earthies — Do n't you mind my using the term ? "
72998	73004	73440	73441	the Earthman	1003	" I use it myself . "
73005	73031	73440	73441	the Earthman	1003	" Because you 're an Earthman . Some Earth - people consider it a term of derision and resent it when a Lunarite uses it . "
73032	73041	73440	73441	the Earthman	1003	" You mean when a Lunie uses it ? "
73048	73056	73045	73045	She	172	" Yes . That 's about it . "
73057	73083	73440	73441	the Earthman	1003	" Well , then , let 's neither of us cry out at words . Go ahead , you were telling me about your job . "
73084	73151	73440	73441	the Earthman	1003	" On my job , there are these Earthies whom I have to keep from killing themselves and whom I have to take here and there and give little speeches to and make sure they eat and drink and walk by the book . They see their little pet sights and do their little pet things , and I have to be terribly polite and motherly . "
73152	73155	73157	73158	the Earthman	1003	" Awful , "
73160	73193	73157	73158	the Earthman	1003	" But you and I can do as we please , I hope , and you are willing to take your chances and I do n't have to watch what I say . "
73194	73208	73440	73441	the Earthman	1003	" I told you that you 're perfectly welcome to call me Earthie . "
73209	73230	73440	73441	the Earthman	1003	" All right , then . I 'll have a busman 's holiday . What would you like to do ? "
73231	73248	73157	73158	the Earthman	1003	" That 's an easy one to answer . I want to see the proton synchrotron . "
73249	73263	73157	73158	the Earthman	1003	" Not that . Maybe Barron can arrange it after you see him . "
73264	73327	73440	73441	the Earthman	1003	" Well , if I ca n't see the synchrotron , I do n't know what else there is to see . I know the radio telescope is on the other side and I do n't suppose there 's any novelty in it , anyway . . . . You tell me . What does n't the average tourist get to see ? "
73328	73393	73157	73158	the Earthman	1003	" A number of things . There are the algae rooms — not the 191 antiseptic processing plants , which you 've seen — but the farms themselves . However , the smell is pretty strong there and I do n't suppose an Earthie — Earthman — would find it particularly appetizing . Earth — men have trouble with the food as it is . "
73394	73408	73157	73158	the Earthman	1003	" Does that surprise you ? Have you ever tasted Earth - food ? "
73409	73432	73440	73441	the Earthman	1003	" Not really . I probably would n't like it , though . It all depends on what you 're used to . "
73433	73438	73440	73441	the Earthman	1003	" I suppose so , "
73445	73463	73440	73441	the Earthman	1003	" If you ate a real steak , you 'd probably gag at the fat and fiber . "
73464	73496	73440	73441	the Earthman	1003	" We could go to the outskirts where the new corridors are being driven into bedrock , but you 'll have to wear special protective garments . There are the factories — "
73497	73505	73440	73441	the Earthman	1003	" You make the choice , Selene . "
73506	73518	73440	73441	the Earthman	1003	" I will , if you will tell me something honestly . "
73519	73529	73440	73441	the Earthman	1003	" I ca n't promise without hearing the question . "
73530	73562	73563	73564	The Earthman	1003	" I said that Earthies that did n't like Earthies tended to stay on the Moon . You did n't correct me . Do you intend to stay on the Moon ? "
73577	73633	73574	73574	He	1003	" Selene , I had trouble getting a visa to the Moon . They said I might be too old for the trip and that if I stayed any . length of time I might find it impossible to return to Earth . So I told them I planned to stay on the Moon permanently . "
73634	73640	73574	73574	He	1003	" You were n't lying ? "
73641	73659	73440	73441	the Earthman	1003	" I was n't sure at the time . But I think I 'll stay here now . "
73660	73682	73440	73441	the Earthman	1003	" I should have thought that they would have been less willing than ever to let you go under those conditions . "
73683	73686	73574	73574	He	1003	" Why ? "
73687	73707	73440	73441	the Earthman	1003	" Generally , the Earth authorities do n't like to send physicists to the Moon on a permanent basis . "
73714	73724	73708	73709	The Earthman	173	" In that respect , I had no trouble . "
73725	73777	73574	73574	He	1003	" Well , then , if you 're going to be one of us , I think you ought to visit the gymnasium . Earthies often want to but we do n't encourage them as a general rule — though it 's not forbidden outright . Immigrants are a different thing . "
73779	73782	73708	73709	The Earthman	173	" Why ? "
73783	73803	73804	73804	She	1185	" Well , for one thing , we exercise in the nude or near - nude . Why not ? "
73817	73892	73804	73804	She	1185	" The temperature is controlled ; the environment is clean . It 's just that where people from Earth are expected to be , nudity becomes unsettling . Some Earthies are shocked ; some are titillated ; and some are both . Well , we 're not going to dress in the gymnasium for their sake , and we 're not going to cope with them , either ; so we keep them out . "
73893	73897	73708	73709	The Earthman	173	" But immigrants ? "
73898	73933	73708	73709	The Earthman	173	" They have to get used to it . In the end , they 'll be discarding clothes , too . And they 'll need the gymnasium even more than the native Lunarites do . "
73934	73969	73804	73804	She	1185	" I 'll be honest with you , Selene . If I encounter female nudity , I 'll find it titillating , too . I 'm not quite so old that I wo n't . "
73970	73977	73978	73978	she	1186	" Well , titillate , then , "
73983	73990	73978	73978	she	1186	" but to yourself . Agreed ? "
73991	74000	74001	74001	He	1187	" Do we have to get undressed too ? "
74009	74052	74001	74001	He	1187	" As spectators ? No . We could , but we do n't have to . You would feel uncomfortable if you did this early in the game and you would n't be a particularly inspiring sight to the rest of us — "
74053	74058	73804	73804	She	1185	" You are frank ! "
74059	74101	73804	73804	She	1185	" Do you think it would be ? Be honest . And as for myself , I have no wish to put you under a special strain in your private titillation . So we might both just as well stay clothed . "
74102	74122	74001	74001	He	1187	" Will there be any objection ? I mean to my being there as an Earthie of uninspirational appearance ? "
74123	74131	73804	73804	She	1185	" Not if I 'm with you . "
74132	74145	73804	73804	She	1185	" Very well , then , Selene . Is it far away ? "
74146	74155	73804	73804	She	1185	" We are there . Just through here . "
74156	74171	74001	74001	He	1187	" Ah , then , you were planning to come here all the time . "
74172	74180	73804	73804	She	1185	" I thought it might be interesting . "
74181	74184	73804	73804	She	1185	" Why ? "
74189	74194	74185	74185	Selene	172	" I just thought . "
74201	74251	74198	74198	his	173	" I 'm beginning to think you never just think . Let me guess . If I 'm to stay on the Moon , I will need to exercise now and then in order to keep muscles , bones , and all my organs , perhaps , in condition . "
74252	74284	74285	74285	They	1188	" Quite true . So do all of us , but immigrants from Earth in particular . The day will come when the gymnasium will be a daily grind for you . "
74297	74311	74291	74292	the Earthman	1003	" This is the first place I 've seen that looks like Earth . "
74312	74317	74198	74198	his	173	" In what way ? "
74318	74348	74198	74198	his	173	" Why it 's big . I did n't imagine you would have such big rooms on the Moon . Desks , office machinery , women at the desks — "
74349	74355	74357	74357	Selene	172	" Bare - breasted women , "
74361	74371	74357	74357	Selene	172	" That part is n't Earthlike , I admit . "
74372	74400	74401	74401	She	172	" We 've got a hold - chute , too , and an elevator for Earthies . There are many levels . . . . But wait . "
74432	74458	74429	74429	Selene	172	" No trouble . And it turns out we 're going to have a melee . A rather good one ; I know the teams . "
74459	74468	74357	74357	Selene	172	" This place is very impressive . Really . "
74469	74494	74357	74357	Selene	172	" If you still mean its size , it 's not nearly big enough . We have three gymnasiums . This is the largest . "
74495	74520	74429	74429	Selene	172	" I 'm somehow pleased that in the Spartan surroundings of the Moon , you can afford to waste so much room on frivolity . "
74521	74524	74525	74525	Selene	172	" Frivolity ! "
74529	74538	74525	74525	Selene	172	" Why do you think this is frivolity ? "
74539	74547	74429	74429	Selene	172	" Melees ? Some sort of game ? "
74548	74611	74429	74429	Selene	172	" You might call it a game . One Earth you can do such things for sports ; ten men doing , ten thousand watching . It 's not so on the Moon ; what 's frivolous for you is necessary for us . . . . This way ; we 'll take the elevator , which means a little waiting perhaps . "
74612	74621	74525	74525	Selene	172	" Did n't mean to get you angry . "
74622	74682	74429	74429	Selene	172	" I 'm not really angry but you must be reasonable . You Earth- 194 men have been adapted to Earth - gravity for all the three hundred million years since life crawled onto dry land . Even if you do n't exercise , you get by . We 've had no time at all to adapt to Moongravity . "
74683	74689	74429	74429	Selene	172	" You look different enough . "
74690	74789	74525	74525	Selene	172	" If you 're born and reared under Moon - gravity , your bones and muscles are , naturally , slimmer and less massive than an Earthie 's would be , but that 's superficial . There is n't a bodily function we possess , however subtle ; digestion , rates of hormonal secretions ; that is n't maladjusted to gravity and that does n't require a deliberate regimen of exercise . If we can arrange exercise in the form of fun and games that does not make it frivolity . . . . Here 's the elevator . "
74816	74855	74799	74799	Selene	172	" I suppose you 're going to tell me it looks like a wickerwork basket . Every Earthman who uses it says so . With Moon - gravity , it does n't have to be any more substantial . "
74874	74883	74870	74871	The Earthman	173	" I suspect this is n't much used . "
74888	74907	74884	74884	Selene	172	" You 're right . The hold - chute is much more popular , and much more fun . "
74908	74913	74870	74871	The Earthman	173	" What is it ? "
74914	74962	74870	74871	The Earthman	173	" Exactly what the name implies . . . . Here we are . We only had to drop two levels . . . . It 's just a vertical tube you can drop through , with handholds . We do n't encourage Earthies to use it . "
74963	74967	74884	74884	Selene	172	" Too risky ? "
74968	75042	75043	75043	She	172	" Not in itself . You can climb down as though it were a ladder . However , there are always youngsters swinging down at considerable speed and Earthies do n't know how to keep out of the way . Collisions are always discomforting . But you 'll get to use it in time . ... In fact , what you 'll see now is a kind of large holdchute designed for recklessness . "
75120	75131	75117	75117	He	173	" The dental problem must be severe on the Moon . "
75132	75138	75108	75108	his	173	" It is n't good , "
75142	75158	75117	75117	He	173	" If we ever get the chance , we 'll select for an edentate jaw . "
75159	75162	75108	75108	his	173	" Toothlessness ? "
75163	75209	75117	75117	He	173	" Maybe not entirely . We might keep the incisors and canines for cosmetic reasons and for occasionally useful tasks . They 're easily cleaned , too . But why should we want useless molars ? It 's just a hangover from an Earthie past . "
75210	75220	75117	75117	He	173	" Are you making any progress in that direction ? "
75221	75224	75225	75225	she	172	" No , "
75230	75239	75240	75240	She	172	" Genetic engineering is illegal . Earth insists . "
75247	75256	75257	75257	she	172	" They call this the Moon 's playground , "
75479	75482	75483	75483	he	173	" Oh , "
75486	75491	75483	75483	he	173	" Men and women . "
75495	75538	75483	75483	he	173	" Right ! The sexes compete equally but the idea is to prevent the uncontrolled swinging of parts that might hamper the guided fall . There 's a sexual difference there which also involves vulnerability to pain . It 's not modesty . "
75543	75552	75539	75540	The Earthman	173	" I think I 've read of this . "
75553	75558	75560	75560	Selene	172	" You may have , "
75564	75594	75560	75560	Selene	172	" Not much seems to get out . Not that we have any objection , but the Terrestrial government prefers to keep news of the Moon to a minimum . "
75595	75600	75539	75540	The Earthman	173	" Why , Selene ? "
75601	75634	75560	75560	Selene	172	" You 're an Earthman . You tell me . . . . Our theory here on the Moon is that we embarrass the Earth . Or at least the Earth government . "
75705	75715	75717	75718	the Earthman	173	" Could n't do that on Earth as gracefully , "
75722	75727	75728	75728	he	173	" Or at all , "
75731	75740	75742	75742	Selene	172	" It 's not just low - gravity , "
75744	75760	75742	75742	Selene	172	" Try it , if you think so . This takes endless hours of practice . "
75783	75793	75795	75796	the Earthman	173	" They can move quickly when they want to , "
75798	75801	75803	75803	Selene	172	" Umm , "
75811	75881	75803	75803	Selene	172	" I suspect that when Earthmen — I mean the real Earthmen , the ones who have never even visited the Moon — think of moving around the Moon , they think of the surface and of spacesuits . That 's often slow , of course . The mass , with the spacesuit added , is huge , which means high inertia and a small gravity to overcome it . "
75882	75886	75888	75889	the Earthman	1003	" Quite right , "
75891	75928	75888	75889	the Earthman	1003	" I 've seen the classic motion 197 pictures of the early astronauts that all school children see and the movements are like those underwater . The picture gets imprinted , even when we know better . "
75929	75949	75951	75951	Selene	172	" You 'd be surprised how fast we can move on the surface these days , spacesuit and all , "
75953	75987	75951	75951	Selene	172	" And here , underground , without spacesuits , we can move as quickly as on Earth . The slower whip of gravity is made up for by the proper use of muscles . "
75988	75997	75998	75999	The Earthman	1003	" But you can move slowly , too . "
76137	76158	76133	76134	The Earthman	173	" I suspect I lack the experience to appreciate the finer points of skill . Are these all native Lunarites ? "
76159	76165	76167	76167	Selene	172	" They have to be , "
76169	76238	76133	76134	The Earthman	173	" The gymnasium is open to all Lunar citizens and some immigrants are fairly good , considering . For this kind of virtuosity , however , you must depend on babies that are conceived and bom here . They have the proper physical adaptation , at least more than native Earthmen have , and they get the proper childhood training . Most of these performers are under eighteen . "
76239	76253	76378	76378	He	173	" I imagine it 's dangerous , even at Moon - gravity levels . "
76254	76313	76378	76378	He	173	" Broken bones are n't very uncommon . I do n't think there 's been an actual death , but there 's been at least one case of broken spine and paralysis . That was a terrible accident ; I was actually watching — Oh , wait now ; we 're going to have the ad libs now . "
76314	76318	76133	76134	The Earthman	173	" The what ? "
76320	76339	76378	76378	He	173	" Till now , we 've had set pieces . The climbs were according to a fixed pattern . "
76381	76394	76378	76378	He	173	" Amazing . He gets around those bars exactly like a gibbon . "
76395	76399	76401	76401	Selene	172	" A what ? "
76403	76426	76427	76427	He	173	" A gibbon . A kind of ape ; in fact , the only ape still existing in the wild . They — "
76436	76453	76427	76427	He	173	" I do n't mean it as an insult , Selene ; they are graceful creatures . "
76459	76467	76454	76454	Selene	172	" I 've seen pictures of apes . "
76468	76516	76517	76517	He	173	" You probably have n't seen gibbons in motion . ... I dare say that Earthies might call Lunarites ' gibbons ' and mean it insultingly , about on the level of what you mean by ' Earthie . ' But I do n't mean it so . "
76540	76574	76537	76537	He	173	" How do you treat Earth - immigrants here on the Moon , Selene . I mean immigrants who mean to stay here life - long . Since they lack true Lunarite abilities — "
76575	76594	76537	76537	He	173	" That makes no difference . Immies are citizens . There 's no discrimination ; no legal discrimination . "
76595	76605	76537	76537	He	173	" What does that mean ? No legal discrimination ? "
76606	76654	76537	76537	He	173	" Well , you said it yourself . There are some things they ca n't do . There are differences . Their medical problems are different and they 've usually had a worse medical history . If they come in middle age , they look — old . "
76662	76674	76655	76656	The Earthman	173	" Can they intermarry ? I mean , immigrants and Lunarites . "
76675	76685	76537	76537	He	173	" Certainly . That is , they can interbreed . "
76686	76695	76537	76537	He	173	" Yes , that 's what I meant . "
76696	76733	76537	76537	He	173	" Of course . No reason why an immigrant ca n't have some worthwhile genes . Heavens , my father was an immie , though I 'm second - generation Lunarite on my mother 's side . "
76734	76753	76754	76754	He	173	" I suppose your father must have come when he was quite — 199 Oh , good Lord — "
76766	76777	76754	76754	He	173	" I thought he was going to miss that bar . "
76778	76783	76785	76785	Selene	172	" Not a chance , "
76787	76834	76785	76785	Selene	172	" That 's Marco Fore . He likes to do that , reach out at the last moment . Actually , it 's bad form to do that and a real champion does n't . Still — My father was twenty - two when he arrived . "
76835	76880	76537	76537	He	173	" I suppose that 's the way . Still young enough to be adaptable ; no emotional complications back on Earth . From the standpoint of the Earthie male , I imagine it must be rather nice to have a sexual attachment with a — "
76881	76885	76886	76886	Selene	172	" Sexual attachment ! "
76899	76929	76886	76886	Selene	172	" You do n't suppose my father had sex with my mother . If my mother heard you say that , she 'd set you right in a hurry . "
76930	76933	76537	76537	He	173	" But — "
76934	76950	76951	76952	The Earthman	173	" ArtiEcial insemination was what it was for goodness sake . Sex with an Earthman ? "
76956	76966	76951	76952	The Earthman	173	" I thought you said there was no discrimination . "
76967	77039	76537	76537	He	173	" That 's not discrimination . That 's a matter of physical fact . An Earthman ca n't handle the gravity field properly . However practiced he might be , under the stress of passion , he might revert . I would n't risk it . The clumsy fool might snap his arm or leg — or worse , mine . Gene mixtures are one thing ; sex is quite another . "
77040	77056	77057	77057	She	1223	" I 'm sorry . . . . Is n't artificial insemination against the law ? "
77065	77188	77057	77057	She	1223	" That 's Marco Fore again . When he is n't trying to be uselessly spectacular , he really is good ; and his sister is almost as good . When they work together it 's really a poem of motion . Look at them now . They 'll come together and circle the same bar as though they have a single body stretched across . He 's a little too flamboyant at times , but you ca n't fault his muscular control . . . . Yes , artificial insemination is against Earth 's law , but it 's allowed where medical reasons are involved , and , of course , that 's often the case , or said to be . "
77249	77258	77260	77261	the Earthman	1003	" You ought to have some seating arrangement , "
77263	77305	77260	77261	the Earthman	1003	" Not at all . This is n't a show . This is exercise . We do n't encourage any more spectators than can stand comfortably about the railing . We 're suppose to be down there , not up here . "
77306	77319	77260	77261	the Earthman	1003	" You mean you can do that sort of thing , Selene ? "
77320	77398	77260	77261	the Earthman	1003	" After a fashion , of course . Any Lunarite can . I 'm not as good as they are . I have n't joined any teams — There 's going to be the melee now , the free - for - all . This is the really dangerous part . All ten are going to be in the air and each side is going to try to send members of the other side into a fall . "
77399	77404	77260	77261	the Earthman	1003	" A real fall . "
77405	77411	77260	77261	the Earthman	1003	" As real as possible . "
77412	77418	77260	77261	the Earthman	1003	" Are there injuries occasionally ? "
77419	77475	77260	77261	the Earthman	1003	" Occasionally . In theory , this sort of thing is frowned upon . That is considered frivolous , and we do n't have so large a population that we can afford to incapacitate anyone without real cause . Still , the melee is popular and we ca n't raise the votes to outlaw it . "
77476	77486	77260	77261	the Earthman	1003	" Which side do you vote on , Selene ? "
77490	77500	77487	77487	Selene	172	" Oh , never mind . You watch this ! "
77578	77619	77575	77575	Selene	172	" The scoring is intricate . There is a point for every launch ; a point for every touch ; two points for every miss inflicted ; ten points for a grounding ; various penalties for various kinds of fouling . "
77621	77627	77575	77575	Selene	172	" Who keeps the score ? "
77628	77657	77665	77668	a girl in blue	1230	" There are umpires watching who make the preliminary decisions and there are television tapes in case of appeals . Very often even the tapes ca n't decide . "
77712	77718	77720	77720	Selene	172	" Where were his eyes ? "
77723	77731	77720	77720	Selene	172	" He did n't see her coming . "
77800	77803	77798	77798	someone	1688	" Foul ! "
77947	77952	77943	77944	The Earthman	173	" Was he fouled ? "
77953	78024	77943	77944	The Earthman	173	" If Jean Wong actually grabbed Marco 's wrist instead of pushing it , it was a foul . The umpire has ruled a fair block , however , and I do n't think Marco will appeal . He fell a lot farther than he had to . He likes these last - minute saves and someday he 'll miscalculate and hurt himself . . . . Oh , oh . "
78046	78063	78043	78043	She	172	" That 's someone from the Commissioner 's office and he must be looking for you . "
78064	78067	78103	78104	the messenger	1239	" Why — "
78068	78089	78103	78104	the messenger	1239	" I do n't see why he should come here to find anyone else . You 're the unusual one . "
78090	78097	78099	78100	the Earthman	1003	" But there 's no reason — "
78154	78157	78158	78158	he	1239	" Sir , "
78161	78170	78158	78158	he	1239	" Commissioner Gottstein requests that you accompany me — "
78223	78243	78213	78213	Selene	172	" If you live like a slob , Barron , how do you expect to have your thoughts neat ? "
78244	78249	78251	78251	Barron	182	" I 'll manage , "
78255	78268	78251	78251	Barron	182	" How is it you have n't brought the Earthman with you ? "
78269	78281	78217	78217	her	172	" The Commissioner got to him first . The new Commissioner . "
78282	78285	78217	78217	her	172	" Gottstein ? "
78286	78298	78251	78251	Barron	182	" That 's right . Why were n't you ready sooner ? "
78299	78314	78315	78315	Selene	172	" Because it took time to find out . I wo n't work blind . "
78318	78330	78315	78315	Selene	172	" Well , then , we 'll just have to wait . "
78343	78368	78331	78331	Neville	182	" I do n't know whether I ought to like the situation or not . . . . What did you think of him ? "
78369	78374	78376	78376	Selene	172	" I liked him , "
78380	78432	78376	78376	Selene	172	" He was rather pleasant , 203 considering he was an Earthie . He let me guide him . He was interested . He made no judgments . He did n't patronize . . . . And I did n't go out of my way to avoid insulting him , either . "
78433	78443	78331	78331	Neville	182	" Did he ask any further about the synchrotron ? "
78444	78455	78376	78376	Selene	172	" No , but then he did n't have to . "
78456	78460	78376	78376	Selene	172	" Why not ? "
78461	78497	78331	78331	Neville	182	" I told him you wanted to see him , and I said you were a physicist . So I imagine he 'll ask you whatever he wants to ask you when he sees you . "
78522	78523	78500	78500	he	1244	" "
78555	78556	78560	78560	Selene	172	" "
78562	78563	78560	78560	Selene	172	" "
78649	78650	78641	78641	I	0	" "
78653	78654	78656	78656	he	1244	" "
78676	78677	78678	78678	You	182	" "
78699	78700	78694	78694	You	182	" "
78733	78748	78749	78749	Selene	172	" Neville leaned back with his hands clasped at the nape of his neck . "
78789	78795	78783	78783	he	404	" Selene paused to think . "
78831	78833	78828	78828	he	404	" 204 "
78938	78943	78927	78927	he	404	" Are you sure ? "
78944	78976	78930	78931	top man	1259	" Believe me , I checked . Did n't you just criticize me for taking so long . . . . And it sounds so good that it 's too good . "
78977	78992	78927	78927	he	404	" Why too good ? I do n't see what you 're getting at . "
78993	79017	78927	78927	he	404	" Does n't it seem to you we ought to trust him ? After all , he 's got a grievance against Earth . "
79018	79032	78930	78931	top man	1259	" You can certainly argue that way , if your facts are right . "
79033	79069	78927	78927	he	404	" Oh , my facts are right , at least in the sense that they 're what turns up , if you dig for them . But maybe we 're supposed to argue that way . "
79070	79092	78927	78927	he	404	" Barron , that 's disgusting . How can you weave these conspiracy theories into everything ? Ben did n't sound — "
79093	79096	79098	79098	Neville	182	" Ben ? "
79102	79105	79107	79107	Selene	172	" Ben ! "
79111	79140	79107	79107	Selene	172	" Ben did n't sound like a man with a grievance or like a man trying to make me think he sounded like a man with a grievance . "
79141	79183	78927	78927	he	404	" No , but he managed to make you think he was someone to be liked . You did say you liked him , did n't you ? With emphasis ? Maybe that 's exactly what he was trying to do . "
79184	79197	78927	78927	he	404	" I 'm not that easy to fool and you know it . "
79198	79212	79107	79107	Selene	172	" Well , I 'll just have to wait till I see him . "
79213	79260	78927	78927	he	404	" The hell with you , Barron . I 've associated with thousands of Earthies of all kinds . It 's my job . And you have no reason whatsoever to speak sarcastically about my judgment . You know you have every reason to trust it . "
79261	79295	79296	79296	he	1261	" All right . We 'll see . Do n't get angry . It 's just that we 'll have to wait now . . . . And as long as we do , "
79303	79310	79296	79296	he	1261	" guess what I 'm thinking ? "
79311	79318	79319	79319	Selene	172	" I do n't have to . "
79342	79356	79332	79332	her	172	" But think it by yourself . I 'm not in the mood . "
79357	79368	79296	79296	he	1261	" Are you annoyed because I 've impugned your judgment ? "
79369	79390	79392	79392	she	172	" I 'm annoyed because — Oh , hell , why do n't you keep your room in better condition ? "
79396	79401	79403	79403	Gottstein	183	" I would like , "
79405	79483	79403	79403	Gottstein	183	" to offer you some Earthside luxury , Doctor , but , as a matter of principle , I have been allowed to bring none . The good people of the Moon resent the artificial barriers imposed by special treatment for men from Earth . It seems better to soothe their sensibilities by assuming the Lunarite pose as far as possible though I 'm afraid my gait will give me away . Their confounded gravity is impossible . "
79488	79503	79484	79485	The Earthman	173	" I find this so also . I congratulate you on your new post — "
79504	79512	79582	79583	The Earthman	173	" Not yet quite mine , sir . "
79513	79533	79484	79485	The Earthman	173	" Still , my congratulations . Yet I ca n't help wondering why you have asked to see me . "
79534	79550	79551	79552	The Earthman	173	" We were shipmates . We arrived not so long ago on the same vessel . "
79559	79581	79556	79556	Gottstein	183	" And my acquaintance with you is a longer one than that . We met — briefly — some years ago . "
79587	79596	79582	79583	The Earthman	173	" I 'm afraid I do n't recall — "
79597	79665	79666	79667	The Earthman	173	" I 'm not surprised at that . There is no reason for you to remember . I was , for a time , on the staff of Senator Burt , who headed — still heads , in fact — the Committee on Technology and the Environment . It was at a time when he was rather anxious to get the goods on Hallam — Frederick Hallam . "
79679	79685	79666	79667	The Earthman	173	" Did you know Hallam ? "
79687	79756	79769	79770	the Earthman	1003	" You 're the second person to ask me that since my coming to the Moon . Yes , I did . Not intimately . I 've known others who 've met him . Oddly enough , their opinion usually coincided with mine . For a person who is apparently idolized by the planet , Hallam inspired little personal liking on the part of those who knew him . "
79757	79767	79769	79770	the Earthman	1003	" Little ? None at all , I think , "
79777	79873	79772	79772	Gottstein	183	" It was my job , at the time — or at least , my assignment from the senator — to investigate the Electron Pump and see if its establishment and growth were accompanied by undue waste and personal profit - taking . It was a legitimate concern for what was essentially a watch - dog committee , but the senator was , between us , hoping to find something of damage to Hallam . He was anxious to decrease the stranglehold that man was gaining on the scientific establishment . There , he failed . "
79874	79889	79769	79770	the Earthman	1003	" That much would be obvious . Hallam is stronger than ever right now . "
79890	79914	79769	79770	the Earthman	1003	" There was no graft to speak of ; certainly none that could be traced to Hallam . The man is rigidly honest . "
79937	79938	79772	79772	Gottstein	183	" "
80004	80011	80012	80012	I	0	" The Earthman said , cautiously , "

81289	81322	81283	81283	I	0	" Carefully , the Commissioner leaned back in his seat . It had a spindly look about it and by Earth standards it would not have supported his weight . He said , "

83017	83083	83084	83084	I	0	" Which was a dismissal . Denison left , and Gottstein looked after him thoughtfully . 7 Denison opened the door by hand . There was a contact that would have opened it automatically , but in the blur of waking , he could not find it . The dark - haired man , with a face that was somehow scowling in repose , said , "
83095	83109	83092	83092	I	0	" Denison repeated the last word to give him time to absorb matters . "

83134	83141	83129	83129	We	1332	" And now Denison had it . "

83160	83200	83156	83156	I	0	" He stepped in as he asked . Denison 's room was small , and held a rumpled bed that took up most of the available space . The ventilator was sighing softly . Neville said with meaningless courtesy , "
83207	83223	83204	83204	I	0	" Denison looked down at his pajamas and passed his hand over his rumpled hair . "
83226	83231	83204	83204	I	0	" he said abruptly . "

83282	83306	83307	83307	I	0	" said Denison . He emerged some twenty minutes later , washed and shaved , wearing trousers and an undershirt . He said , "

83391	83441	83381	83381	I	0	" He sat down with something less than enthusiasm and tasted the pasty yellow mixture that clearly was what the other meant by scrambled eggs . He tried not to make a face at the first taste and then manfully swallowed it and dug in for a second forkful . "
83451	83455	83442	83442	You	0	" said Neville , "

83829	83865	83866	83866	She	172	" Denison , having swallowed a spoonful of the soup , looked at it as though he were wondering what to do with the rest . Grimly , he continued the task of downing it . "

84107	84118	84063	84063	ourselves	1345	" Denison asked , with a faint note of surprise . "

86680	86693	86677	86677	you	1407	" said Neville . There was a short pause . Selene said , "

86883	86911	86871	86871	You	1407	" 10 Selene laughed , and the sound was metallic in Denison 's earpiece . Her figure was lost in the spacesuit she wore . She said , "
86939	86941	86933	86933	you've	198	" 223 "
86947	86959	86933	86933	you've	198	" mumbled Denison . He felt smothered in his own suit . "
86963	86967	86933	86933	you've	198	" insisted Selene . "
86989	87004	86933	86933	you've	198	" She pointed to the brilliant curve of the Earth in the southern sky . "

87074	87188	87197	87197	you	0	" Denison looked about doubtfully . The Moon lay beautiful in the cold light of the Earth . It was black and white ; a mild and delicate white as compared with the Sunlit views he had seen when he had taken a trip a week before to inspect the Solar batteries that stretched from horizon to horizon along the floor of Mare Imbrium . And the black was somehow softer , too , through lack of the blazing contrast of true day . The stars were supernally bright and the Earth — the Earth — was infinitely inviting with its swirls of white on blue , and its peeping glimpse of tan . "
87191	87195	87197	87197	you	0	" he said , "

87246	87303	87241	87241	I	0	" Her steps were long , slow , and swinging , and he tried to keep in synchronization . The up - sloping ground beneath them was dusty and with each step he kicked up a fine powder that settled quickly in the airlessness . He matched her stride for stride , but with an effort . "
87306	87319	87320	87320	You	198	" said Selene , her arm locked in his , steadying him . "

87450	87488	87448	87448	me	0	" Denison paused thankfully and watched Selene , somehow slim and graceful despite the grotesquerie of the suit once she moved , take off into low , loping leaps . She returned and knelt at his feet . "
87511	87521	87499	87499	I	0	" They tried several times , and Denison said , "

87587	87591	87578	87578	I	0	" Denison said , "

87667	87688	87657	87657	I	0	" Gingerly , Denison sat down with a grunt . Deliberately , he faced northward , away from the Earth . "
87694	87731	87657	87657	I	0	" Selene sat facing him , at right angles . He could see her face now and then , dimly through the faceplate , when the Earthlight caught it at the proper angle . She said , "

88177	88200	88170	88170	you	0	" Denison leaned back and kicked his legs up alternately , watching them rise and fall slowly with a certain lazy pleasure . "
88328	88339	88321	88321	you	1442	" Selene rose to her feet suddenly , and said , "
88354	88363	88398	88398	Ben	198	" He struggled to his feet and said , "
88392	88393	88386	88386	he	1445	" "
88422	88459	88386	88386	he	1445	" They made their way up the final stretch silently . Denison was aware of the smoother area to their side ; a wide swathe of slope from which most of the dust had been brushed . "
88471	88479	88386	88386	he	1445	" Selene said , answering his thoughts . "
88499	88520	88489	88489	me	0	" She made a kangaroo - hop as she spoke , turned about face almost before landing , and said , "
88531	88545	88527	88527	I	0	" Denison did , facing downhill . He looked down the slope uncertainly . "
88553	88554	88547	88547	you	0	" "
88637	88638	88641	88641	Selene	172	" "
88643	88644	88641	88641	Selene	172	" "
88657	88679	88617	88617	you	198	" She had a small cartridge in her hand . Clamps and a pair of thin tubes were attached to it . "
88684	88689	88617	88617	you	198	" asked Ben . 227 "
88736	88741	88742	88742	I	0	" Denison said uneasily . "
88760	88761	88769	88769	you	0	" "
88879	88880	88874	88874	I	0	" "
88886	88887	88874	88874	I	0	" "
88925	88936	88893	88893	You	198	" She stood up and helped him to his feet . "
88963	88964	88997	88997	I	0	" "
88971	88977	88997	88997	I	0	" said Denison , sulkily . "
88986	88987	88997	88997	I	0	" "
89110	89111	89112	89112	I	0	" "

89177	89234	89300	89300	I	0	" Denison swallowed and looked ahead . The southward slide was gleaming in Earthlight . Minute unevennesses caught more than their share of light , leaving tiny uphill patches in darkness so that there was a vague mottling of the surface . The bulging half - circle of Earth rode the black sky almost directly ahead . "
89237	89249	89300	89300	I	0	" said Selene . Her gauntleted hand was between his shoulders . "
89252	89257	89300	89300	I	0	" said Denison faintly . "
89263	89295	89260	89260	you	198	" she said . She pushed and Denison felt himself begin to move . He moved quite slowly at first . He turned toward her , wobbling , and she said , "
89307	89387	89300	89300	I	0	" He could feel the ground beneath his feet — and then he could n't . The glider had been activated . For a moment he felt as though he were standing still . There was no push of air against his body , no feel of anything sliding past his feet . But when he turned toward Selene again , he noticed that the lights and shadows to one side were moving backward at a slowly increasing speed . "
89395	89404	89300	89300	I	0	" Selene 's voice said in his ear , "
89439	89440	89437	89437	Ben	198	" "
89445	89449	89437	89437	Ben	198	" gasped Denison . "
89455	89456	89437	89437	Ben	198	" "
89460	89539	89540	89540	I	0	" he said . The pattern of light and dark on either side was moving backward in a blur . He looked briefly to one side , then the other , trying to convert the sensation of a backward flight of the surroundings into one of a forward flight of his own . Then , as soon as he succeeded , he found he had to look forward hastily at the Earth to regain his sense of balance . "
89563	89565	89553	89553	You	198	" 229 "
89584	89630	89578	89578	I	0	" She was keeping up with him easily . Denison was going fast enough now so that he got the sensation of motion even when he looked ahead . The Moonscape ahead was opening before him and flowing past on either side . He said , "
89642	89643	89578	89578	I	0	" "
89650	89654	89578	89578	I	0	" said Selene , "
89690	89691	89679	89679	You	198	" "
89701	89702	89679	89679	You	198	" "
89751	89843	89846	89846	Ben	198	" Selene had barely completed her remarks when Denison felt the beginning of pressure under his boots . There was at once an overwhelming sensation of speed and he clenched his fists hard to keep from throwing his arms up in an almost reflex gesture against the collision that was n't going to happen . He knew that if he threw up his arms , he would go over backward . He narrowed his eyes , held his breath till he thought his lungs would explode , and then Selene said , "
89881	89882	89883	89883	I	0	" "
89890	89932	89883	89883	I	0	" whispered Denison . He caught a large , ragged breath , and opened his eyes wide . The Earth was as serene as ever , as uncaring . He was moving more slowly now — more slowly — more slowly — "
89941	89945	89939	89939	Selene	172	" he asked . "
89951	89952	89953	89953	You	172	" "
89994	90047	89983	89983	I	0	" Denison watched her with disbelief . She had climbed up with him , had glided down with him . Yet he was half - dead with weariness and tension , and she was in the air with long kangaroo- 230 leaps . She seemed a hundred yards away when she said , "
90052	90088	89983	89983	I	0	" and her voice was as loud in his ears as when she was next him . She was back in a moment , with a folded , paunchy sheet of plastic under her arm . "
90091	90097	90099	90099	you	1464	" she said , cheerily , "
90121	90136	90109	90109	I	0	" She unfolded it and spread it on the dusty surface of the Moon . "
90145	90149	90109	90109	I	0	" she said , "
90169	90203	90158	90158	We	1462	" She inserted a cartridge and tripped a lever . It began to fill . Somehow Denison had expected a hissing noise , but of course there was no air to carry sound . "
90212	90216	90158	90158	We	1462	" said Selene , "
90222	90234	90158	90158	We	1462	" It blossomed into a mattress on six , stubby legs . "
90240	90244	90245	90245	It	1468	" she said . "
90264	90265	90245	90245	It	1468	" "
90274	90280	90269	90269	me	0	" said Denison , amazed . "
90334	90346	90447	90447	I	0	" Denison did so , with a sensation of enormous luxury . "
90349	90357	90447	90447	I	0	" he said with a long sigh . "
90364	90421	90358	90359	Mamma Selene	172	" she said . She came from behind him now , gliding around him , her feet placed heel to heel as though she were on skates , and then let them fly out from under her , as she came down gracefully on hip and elbow on the ground just beside him . Denison whistled . "
90428	90429	90424	90424	you	172	" "
90470	90472	90458	90458	I	0	" 231 "
90476	90480	90458	90458	I	0	" he said , "
90488	90489	90458	90458	I	0	" "
90506	90507	90503	90503	you	172	" "

90740	90799	90735	90735	You	1464	" Denison could feel the ultimate quiet of the Moon soaking into him as he lay there . He was facing the Earth this time . Its steady presence in the sky had , more than anything else , given him the sensation of stability during his recent glide and he felt grateful to it . He said , "
90832	90833	90822	90822	You	172	" "
90862	90863	90851	90851	I	0	" "
90868	90874	90851	90851	I	0	" said Denison , noncommittally . "
90880	90881	90875	90875	You	172	" "
90916	90917	90894	90894	he	1476	" "
90979	90980	90969	90970	corridor people	1482	" "
90983	90984	90969	90970	corridor people	1482	" "
91027	91043	91022	91022	I	0	" — and she dropped into the clipped accents of the typical Earthie speaking Planetary Standard "
91095	91169	91170	91170	Denison	198	" Oh , I could go on and on , Ben . Then they say , ' But I suppose you do n't know what blue sky and sea and trees are like so you do n't miss them . ' ... As if we do n't receive Earthtelevision and as if we do n't have full access to Earth - literature , both optical and auditory — and olfactory sometimes , too . "
91177	91188	91174	91174	He	198	" What 's the official answer to remarks like that ? "
91189	91255	91170	91170	Denison	198	" Nothing much . We just say , ' We 're quite used to it , madam . ' Or ' sir ' if it 's a man . Usually it 's a woman . The men are too interested in studying our blouses and wondering when we take them off , I suppose . You know what I 'd like to tell the idiots ? "
91256	91286	91174	91174	He	198	" Please tell me . As long as you have to keep the blouse on , it being inside the suit , at least get that off your chest . "
91287	91473	91474	91474	Denison	198	" Funny , funny word play ! ... I 'd like to tell them , ' Look , madam , why the hell should we be interested in your damned world ? We do n't want to be hanging on the outside of any planet and waiting to fall off or get blown off . We do n't want raw air puffing at us and dirty water falling on us . We do n't want your damned germs and your smelly grass and your dull blue sky and your dull white clouds . We can see Earth in our own sky when we want to , and we do n't often want to . The Moon is our home and it 's what we make it ; exactly what we make it . We own it and we build our own ecology , and we do n't need you here being sorry for us going our own way . Go 233 back to your own world and let your gravity pull your breasts down to your knees . ' That 's what I 'd say . "
91477	91505	91474	91474	Denison	198	" All right . Whenever you get too close to saying that to some Earthie , you come say it to me and you 'll feel better . "
91506	91560	91174	91174	He	198	" You know what ? Every once in a while , some Immie suggests that we build an Earth - park on the Moon ; some little spot with Earth - plants brought in as seeds or seedlings ; maybe some animals . A touch of home — that 's the usual expression . "
91561	91570	91174	91174	He	198	" I take it you 're against that . "
91571	91616	91474	91474	Denison	198	" Of course , I 'm against it . A touch of whose home ? The Moon is our home . An Immie who wants a touch of home had better get back to his home . Immies can be worse than Earthies sometimes . "
91617	91625	91627	91627	Denison	198	" I 'll keep that in mind , "
91629	91636	91638	91638	Selene	172	" Not you — so far , "
91714	91727	91711	91711	Selene	172	" Ben , do you mind if I ask you a question ? "
91728	91789	91980	91980	Selene	172	" Not at all . If it 's my private life that interests you , I am without secrets . I 'm five - foot - nine , weigh twenty eight pounds on the Moon , had one wife long ago , now divorced , one child , a daughter , grown - up and married , attended University of — "
91790	91806	91711	91711	Selene	172	" No , Ben . I 'm serious . Can I ask about your work ? "
91807	91829	91711	91711	Selene	172	" Of course you can , Selene . I do n't know how much I can explain to you , though . "
91830	91840	91980	91980	Selene	172	" Well — You know that Barron and I — "
91841	91847	91849	91849	Denison	198	" Yes , I know , "
91853	91877	91849	91849	Denison	198	" We talk together . He tells me things sometimes . He said you think the Electron Pump might make the Universe explode . "
91878	91898	91711	91711	Selene	172	" Our section of the Universe . It might convert a part of our Galactic arm into a quasar . "
91900	91909	91910	91910	Denison	198	" Really ? Do you really think so ? "
91913	91939	91910	91910	Denison	198	" When I came to the Moon , I was n't sure . Now I am . I am personally convinced that this will happen . "
91940	91949	91980	91980	Selene	172	" When do you think it will happen ? "
91950	91970	91980	91980	Selene	172	" That I ca n't say exactly . Maybe a few years from now . Maybe a few decades . "
91988	91995	91980	91980	Selene	172	" Barron does n't think so . "
91996	92029	91980	91980	Selene	172	" I know he does n't . I 'm not trying to convert him . You do n't beat refusal to believe in a frontal attack . That 's Lamont 's mistake . "
92030	92035	91980	91980	Selene	172	" Who 's Lamont ? "
92036	92049	91980	91980	Selene	172	" I 'm sorry , Selene . I 'm talking to myself . "
92050	92065	92066	92066	Denison	198	" No , Ben . Please tell me . I 'm interested . Please . "
92075	92079	92080	92080	he	198	" All right , "
92083	92143	92080	92080	he	198	" I have no objection to telling you . Lamont , a physicist back on Earth , tried in his way to alert the world to the dangers of the Pump . He failed . Earthmen want the Pump ; they want the free energy ; they want it enough to refuse to believe they ca n't have it . "
92144	92157	91980	91980	Selene	172	" But why should they want it , if it means death ? "
92158	92254	92255	92255	Selene	172	" All they have to do is refuse to believe it means death . The easiest way to solve a problem is to deny it exists . Your friend , Dr. Neville , does the same thing . He dislikes the surface , so he forces himself to believe that Solar batteries are no good — even though to any impartial observer they would seem the perfect energy source for the Moon . He wants the Pump so he can stay underground , so he refuses to believe there can be any danger from it . "
92258	92282	92255	92255	Selene	172	" I do n't think Barron would refuse to believe something for which valid evidence existed . Do you really have the evidence ? "
92283	92318	91980	91980	Selene	172	" I think I do . It 's most amazing really , Selene . The whole thing depends on certain subtle factors of quark - quark interactions . Do you know what that means ? "
92320	92348	92255	92255	Selene	172	" You do n't have to explain . I 've talked so much to Barron about all sorts of things that I might be able to follow . "
92349	92433	91980	91980	Selene	172	" Well , I thought I would need the Lunar proton synchrotron for the purpose . It 's twenty - five miles across , has superconducting magnets , and can dispose of energies of 20,000 Bev and more . It turns out , though , that you people have something you call a Pionizer , which fits into a moderately - sized room and does all the work of the synchrotron . The Moon is to be congratulated on a most amazing advance . "
92434	92438	92440	92440	Selene	172	" Thank you , "
92444	92453	92440	92440	Selene	172	" I mean on behalf of the Moon . "
92454	92495	91980	91980	Selene	172	" Well , then , my Pionizer results can show the rate of increase of intensity of strong nuclear interaction ; and the increase is what Lamont says it is and not what the orthodox theory would have it be . "
92496	92505	91980	91980	Selene	172	" And have you shown it to Barron ? "
92506	92587	92440	92440	Selene	172	" No , I have n't . And if I do , I expect Neville to reject it . He 'll say the results are marginal . He 'll say I 've made an error . He 'll say that I have n't taken all factors into account . He 'll say I 've used inadequate controls . . . . What he 'll really be saying is that he wants the Electron Pump and wo n't give it up . "
92588	92597	91980	91980	Selene	172	" You mean there 's no way out . "
92598	92615	91980	91980	Selene	172	" Of course there is , but not the direct way . Not Lamont 's way . "
92616	92621	91980	91980	Selene	172	" What 's that ? "
92622	92701	92440	92440	Selene	172	" Lamont 's solution is to force abandonment of the Pump , but you ca n't just move backward . You ca n't push the chicken back into the egg , wine back into the grape , the boy back into the womb . If you want the baby to let go of your watch , you do n't just try to explain that he ought to do it — you offer him something he would rather have . "
92702	92708	91980	91980	Selene	172	" And what 's that ? "
92709	92754	91980	91980	Selene	172	" Ah , that 's where I 'm not so sure . I do have an idea , a simple idea — perhaps too simple to work — based on the quite obvious fact that the number two is ridiculous and ca n't exist . "
92780	92787	92768	92769	236 Selene	172	" Let me guess your meaning . "
92788	92798	92800	92800	Denison	198	" I do n't know that I have any , "
92802	92929	92930	92930	Denison	198	" Let me guess , anyway . It could make sense to suppose that our own Universe is the only one that can exist or does exist , because it is the only one we live in and directly experience . Once , however , evidence arises that there is a second Universe as well , the one we call the para - Universe , then it becomes absolutely ridiculous to suppose that there are two and only two Universes . If a second Universe can exist , then an infinite number can . Between one and the infinite in cases such as these , there are no sensible numbers . Not only two , but any finite number , is ridiculous and ca n't exist . "
92933	92940	92930	92930	Denison	198	" That 's exactly my reas — "
92966	92977	92963	92963	He	198	" I think we had better go back to town . "
92981	92987	92988	92988	He	198	" I was just guessing . "
92991	93008	92988	92988	He	198	" No , you were n't . Whatever it was , it was n't just guessing . "
93057	93060	93054	93054	he	198	" Why ? "
93064	93105	93054	93054	he	198	" It was an accident , really , I saw the point and I was too enthusiastic not to speak . I should have told you days ago but I was afraid your reaction would be exactly what it is . "
93106	93114	93115	93115	She	1492	" So he knows . You fool ! "
93118	93231	93115	93115	She	1492	" What does he know ? Only what he would have 237 guessed sooner or later — that I 'm not really a tourist guide — that I 'm your Intuitionist . An Intuitionist who knows no mathematics , for heaven 's sake . So what if he knows that ? What does it matter if I have intuition ? How many times have you told me that my intuition has no value till it is backed by mathematical rigor and experimental observation ? How many times have you told me that the most compelling intuition could be wrong ? Well , then , what value will he place on mere Intuitionism ? "
93253	93273	93250	93250	He	182	" You 're different . Has n't your intuition always proved right ? When you were sure of it ? "
93274	93287	93418	93418	his	182	" Ah , but he does n't know that , does he ? "
93288	93299	93250	93250	He	182	" He 'll guess it . He 'll see Gottstein . "
93300	93319	93250	93250	He	182	" What will he tell Gottstein ? He still has no idea of what we 're really after . "
93320	93325	93418	93418	his	182	" Does n't he ? "
93326	93329	93250	93250	He	182	" No . "
93346	93407	93339	93339	she	172	" Nol It 's cheap of you to imply that I would betray you and the rest . If you do n't accept my integrity then accept my common sense . There 's no point in telling them . What 's the use of it to them , or to us , if we 're all going to be destroyed ? "
93408	93415	93418	93418	his	182	" Oh , please , Selene ! "
93423	93427	93418	93418	his	182	" Not that . "
93428	93510	93418	93418	his	182	" No . You listen . He talked to me and described his work . You hide me like a secret weapon . You tell me that I 'm more valuable than any instrument or any ordinary scientist . You play your games of conspiracy , insisting that everyone must continue to think me a tourist guide and nothing more so that my great talents will always be available to the Lunarites . To you . And what do you accomplish ? "
93511	93534	93339	93339	she	172	" We have you , have n't we ? How long do you suppose you would have remained free , if they — "
93535	93622	93418	93418	his	182	" You keep saying things like that . But who 's been imprisoned ? Who 's been stopped ? Where is the evidence of the great conspiracy you see all around you ? The Earthmen keep you and your team from their large instruments much more because you goad 238 them into it than out of any malice on their part . And that 's done us good , rather than harm , since it 's forced us to invent other instruments that are more subtle . "
93623	93632	93633	93633	Selene	172	" Based on your theoretical insight , Selene . "
93636	93647	93633	93633	Selene	172	" I know . Ben was very complimentary about them . "
93648	93665	93418	93418	his	182	" You and your Ben . What the hell do you want with that miserable Earthie ? "
93666	93723	93418	93418	his	182	" He 's an Immigrant . And what I want is information . Do you give me any ? You 're so damned afraid I 'll be caught , you do n't dare let me be seen talking to any physicist ; only you , and you 're my — For that reason only , probably . "
93724	93729	93730	93730	He	1493	" Now , Selene . "
93748	93841	93842	93842	Neville	182	" No , I do n't care about that really . You 've told me I have this one task and I 've tried to concentrate on it and sometimes I think I have it , mathematics or not . I can visualize it ; the kind of thing that must be done — and then it slips away . But what 's the use of it , when the Pump will destroy us all anyway . . . . Have n't I told you I distrusted the exchange of field intensities ? "
93845	93883	93842	93842	Neville	182	" I 'll ask you again . Are you ready to tell me that the Pump will destroy us ? Never mind might , never mind ' could ' ; never mind anything but ' will . ' "
93890	93921	93886	93886	her	172	" I ca n't . It 's so marginal . I ca n't say it will . But is n't a simple ' might ' sufficient in such a case ? "
93922	93927	93842	93842	Neville	182	" Oh , Lord . "
93928	93956	93842	93842	Neville	182	" Do n't turn up your eyes . Do n't sneer ! You 've never tested the matter . I told you how it might be tested . "
93957	93975	93886	93886	her	172	" You were never this worried about it till you started listening to this Earthie of yours . "
93976	93990	93842	93842	Neville	182	" He 's an Immigrant . Are n't you going to test it ? "
93991	94033	93842	93842	Neville	182	" No ! I told you your suggestions were impractical . You 're not an experimentalist , and what looks good in your mind does n't necessarily work in the real world of instruments , of randomness , and of uncertainty . "
94035	94046	94047	94047	Her	1494	" The so - called real world of your laboratory . "
94064	94119	94054	94054	she	1494	" You waste so much time trying to get a vacuum good enough — There 's a vacuum up there , up there on the surface where I 'm pointing , with temperatures that , at times , are halfway down toward absolute zero . Why do n't you try experiments on the surface ? "
94120	94127	93842	93842	Neville	182	" It would have been useless . "
94128	94239	93842	93842	Neville	182	" How do you know ? You just wo n't try . Ben Denison tried . He took the trouble to devise a system he could use on the surface and he set it up when he went to inspect the Solar batteries . He wanted you to come and you would n't . Do you remember ? It was a very simple thing , something even I could describe to you now that it 's been described to me . He ran it at day - temperatures and again at night - temperatures and that was enough to guide him to a new line of research with the Pionizer . "
94240	94248	94054	94054	she	1494	" How simple you make it sound . "
94249	94316	93842	93842	Neville	182	" How simple it is . Once he found out I was an Intuitionist , he talked to me as you never did . He explained his reasons for thinking that the strengthening of the strong nuclear interaction is indeed accumulating catastrophically in the neighborhood of Earth . It will only be a few years before the Sun explodes and sends the strengthening , in ripples — "
94317	94326	94328	94328	Neville	182	" No , no , no , no , "
94330	94342	94328	94328	Neville	182	" I 've seen his results and I 'm not impressed . "
94343	94349	93842	93842	Neville	182	" You 've seen them ? "
94350	94441	93842	93842	Neville	182	" Yes , of course . Do you suppose I let him work in our laboratories without making sure I know what he 's doing . I 've seen his results and they 're worth nothing . He deals with tiny deviations that are well within the experimental error . If he wants to believe that those deviations have significance and if you want to believe them , go ahead . But no amount of belief will make them have that significance if , in fact , they do n't . "
94442	94452	93842	93842	Neville	182	" What do you want to believe , Barron ? "
94453	94459	93842	93842	Neville	182	" I want the truth . "
94460	94518	93842	93842	Neville	182	" But have n't you decided in advance what the truth must be 240 by your own gospel ? You want the Pump Station of the Moon , do n't you , so that you need have nothing to do with the surface ; and anything that might prevent that is not the truth — by definition . "
94519	94557	93842	93842	Neville	182	" I wo n't argue with you . I want the Pump Station , and even more — I want the other . One 's no good without the other . Are you sure you have n't — "
94558	94563	93842	93842	Neville	182	" I have n't . "
94564	94568	94569	94569	Selene	172	" Will you ? "
94602	94610	94611	94611	she	172	" I wo n't tell him anything , "
94614	94712	94611	94611	she	172	" but I must have more information . You have no information for me , but he may have ; or he may get it with the experiments you wo n't do . I 've got to talk to him and find out what he is going to find out . If you get between him and me , you 'll never have what you want . And you need n't fear his getting it before I do . He 's too used to Earth thinking ; he wo n't make that last step . I will . "
94713	94785	94896	94896	she	172	" All right . And do n't forget the difference between Earth and Moon , either . This is your world ; you have no other . This man , Denison , this Ben , this Immigrant , having come from Earth to Moon can , if he chooses , return from Moon to Earth . You can never go to the Earth ; never . You are a Lunarite forever . "
94786	94792	94794	94794	Selene	172	" A Moon - maiden , "
94798	94802	94804	94804	Neville	182	" No maiden , "
94806	94824	94825	94825	She	172	" Though you may have to wait a long while before I confirm the matter once again . "
94834	94880	94831	94831	He	182	" And about this big danger of explosion . If the risk involved in changing the basic constants of a Universe is so great , why have n't the para - men , who are so far advanced beyond us in technology , stopped Pumping ? "
94899	94914	94896	94896	she	172	" Because conditions are different for them and for us , you incredible jerk . "
95082	95086	95078	95078	she	172	" the other . "
95203	95242	95194	95194	Selene	172	" Now , Ben , there 's nothing wrong with your bare body , barring a certain flabbiness . It 's perfectly in fashion here . In fact , take off your briefs if they 're binding you . "
95244	95247	95249	95249	Denison	198	" No ! "
95272	95319	95269	95269	She	172	" Now give me that thing . What kind of a Lunarite will you make if you bring your Earth puritanism here ? You know that prudery is only the other side of prurience . The words are even on the same page in the dictionary . "
95320	95331	95194	95194	Selene	172	" I have to get used to it , Selene . "
95332	95370	95269	95269	She	172	" You might start by looking at me once in awhile , without having your glance slide off me as though I were coated with oil . You look at other women quite efficiently , I notice . "
95371	95378	95269	95269	She	172	" If I look at you — "
95379	95428	95429	95429	Denison	198	" Then you 'll seem too interested and you 'll be embarrassed . But if you look hard , you 'll get used to it , and you 'll stop noticing . Look , I 'll stand still and you stare . I 'll take off my briefs . "
95432	95461	95429	95429	Denison	198	" Selene , there are people all around and you 're making intolerable fun of me . Please keep walking and let me get used to the situation . "
95462	95482	95269	95269	She	172	" All right , but I hope you notice the people who pass us do n't look at us . "
95483	95514	95429	95429	Denison	198	" They do n't look at you . They look at me all right . They 've probably never seen so old - looking and ill - shaped a person . "
95515	95521	95523	95523	Selene	172	" They probably have n't , "
95527	95539	95523	95523	Selene	172	" but they 'll just have to get used to it . "
95619	95626	95627	95627	he	198	" How far have we come ? "
95630	95635	95627	95627	he	198	" Are you tired ? "
95640	95655	95636	95636	Selene	172	" We could have taken a scooter . I forget you 're from Earth . "
95656	95697	95627	95627	he	198	" I should hope you do . Is n't that the ideal for an immigrant . I 'm not the least bit tired . Hardly the least bit tired at any rate . What I am is a little cold . "
95699	95706	95708	95708	Selene	172	" Purely your imagination , Ben , "
95712	95736	95708	95708	Selene	172	" You just think you ought to feel cold because so much of you is bare . Put it out of your head . "
95737	95742	95743	95743	he	198	" Easy to say , "
95746	95755	95743	95743	he	198	" I 'm walking well , I hope . "
95756	95767	95708	95708	Selene	172	" Very well . I 'll have you kangarooing yet . "
95768	95797	95708	95708	Selene	172	" And participating in glider races down the surface slopes . Remember , I 'm moderately advanced in years . But really , how far have we come ? "
95798	95806	95708	95708	Selene	172	" Two miles , I should judge . "
95807	95820	95708	95708	Selene	172	" Good Lord ! How many miles of corridors are there altogether ? "
95821	95871	95708	95708	Selene	172	" I 'm afraid I do n't know . The residential corridors make up comparatively little of the total . There are the mining corridors , the geological ones , the industrial , the mycological . . . . I 'm sure there must be several hundred miles altogether . "
95872	95878	95708	95708	Selene	172	" Do you have maps ? "
95879	95892	95708	95708	Selene	172	" Of course there are maps . We ca n't work blind . "
95893	95900	95708	95708	Selene	172	" I mean you , personally . "
95901	95993	95708	95708	Selene	172	" Well , no , not with me , but I do n't need maps for this area ; it 's quite familiar to me . I used to wander about here as a child . These are old corridors . Most of the new corridors — and we average two or three miles of new corridors a year , I think — are in the north . I could n't work my way through them , without a map , for untold sums . Maybe not even with a map . "
95994	96000	95708	95708	Selene	172	" Where are we heading ? "
96001	96044	95708	95708	Selene	172	" I promised you an unusual sight — no , not me , so do n't say it — and you 'll have it . It 's the Moon 's most unusual mine and it 's completely off the ordinary tourist trails . "
96045	96058	95708	95708	Selene	172	" Do n't tell me you 've got diamonds on the Moon ? "
96059	96064	95708	95708	Selene	172	" Better than that . "
96150	96156	96158	96158	Denison	198	" Is all this airtight ? "
96183	96251	96158	96158	Denison	198	" Oh , yes . Those walls are impervious . They 're all boobytrapped , too . If the air pressure drops as much as ten per cent in any section of the corridors there is such a hooting and howling from sirens as you have never heard and such a flashing of arrows and blazing of signs directing you to safety as you have never seen . "
96252	96259	96358	96358	Denison	198	" How often does this happen ? "
96260	96280	96158	96158	Denison	198	" Not often . I do n't think anyone has been killed through airlack for at least five years . "
96287	96306	96158	96158	Denison	198	" You have natural catastrophes on Earth . A big quake or a tidal wave can kill thousands . "
96307	96313	96314	96314	He	198	" No argument , Selene . "
96320	96324	96317	96317	his	198	" I surrender . "
96325	96329	96330	96330	she	1506	" All right , "
96333	96348	96349	96349	She	1506	" I did n't mean to get excited . ... Do you hear that ? "
96374	96392	96370	96370	he	198	" It 's so quiet . Where is everybody ? Are you sure we 're not lost ? "
96393	96419	96349	96349	She	1506	" This is n't a natural cavern with unknown passageways . You have those on Earth , have n't you ? I 've seen photographs . "
96420	96448	96349	96349	She	1506	" Yes , most of them are limestone caves , formed by water . That certainly ca n't be the case of the Moon , can it ? "
96449	96457	96459	96459	Selene	172	" So we ca n't be lost , "
96463	96475	96459	96459	Selene	172	" If we 're alone , put it down to superstition . "
96476	96480	96481	96481	Denison	198	" To what ? "
96494	96500	96501	96501	she	1506	" Do n't do that , "
96504	96539	96501	96501	she	1506	" You get all lined . That 's right . Smooth out . You look much better than you did when you first arrived , you know . That 's low gravity and exercise . "
96540	96576	96459	96459	Selene	172	" And trying to keep up with nude young ladies who have an uncommon amount of off - time and an uncommon lack of better things to do than to go on busmen 's holidays . "
96577	96595	96501	96501	she	1506	" Now you 're treating me like a tourist guide again , and I 'm not nude . "
96597	96619	96501	96501	she	1506	" At that , even nudity is less frightening than Intuitionism . . . . But what 's this about superstition ? "
96620	96649	96459	96459	Selene	172	" Not really superstition , I suppose , but most of the people of the city tend to stay away from this part of the corridor - complex . "
96650	96654	96459	96459	Selene	172	" But why ? "
96655	96666	96667	96667	They	1507	" Because of what I 'm going to show you . "
96672	96677	96678	96678	She	1506	" Hear it now ? "
96688	96706	96685	96685	He	198	" You mean that small tapping sound ? Tap — tap — Is that what you mean ? "
96738	96743	96728	96728	He	198	" Here — here — "
96754	96758	96759	96759	he	198	" Good Lord , "
96762	96769	96759	96759	he	198	" Where 's it coming from ? "
96799	96837	96759	96759	he	198	" From the rocks . We do have water on the Moon , you know . Most of it we can bake out of gypsum ; enough for our purposes , since we conserve it pretty well . "
96838	96869	96759	96759	he	198	" I know . I know . I 've never yet been able to manage one complete shower . How you people manage to stay clean I do n't know . "
96870	96990	96759	96759	he	198	" I told you . First , wet yourself . Then turn off the water and smear just a little detergent on you . You rub it — Oh , Ben , I 'm not going through it yet again . And there 's nothing on the Moon to get you all that dirty anyway . . . . But that 's not what we 're talking about . In one or two places there are actually water deposits , usually as ice near the surface in a mountain shadow . If we locate it , it drips out . This one has been dripping since the corridor was first driven through , and that was eight years ago . "
96991	96997	96759	96759	he	198	" But why the superstition ? "
96998	97082	96759	96759	he	198	" Well , obviously , water is the great material resource on which the Moon depends . We drink it , wash with it , grow our food with it , make our oxygen with it , keep everything going with it . 246 Free water ca n't help but get a lot of respect . Once this drip was discovered , plans to extend the tunnels in this direction were abandoned till it stopped . The corridor walls were even left unfinished . "
97083	97091	96759	96759	he	198	" That sounds like superstition right there . "
97092	97189	97190	97190	Denison	198	" Well — a kind of awe , maybe . It was n't expected to last for more than a few months ; such drips never do . Well , after this one had passed its first anniversary , it began to seem eternal . In fact , that 's what it 's called : ' The Eternal . ' You 'll even find it marked that way on the maps . Naturally people have come to attach importance to it ; a feeling that if it stops it will mean some sort of bad fortune . "
97198	97299	97193	97193	Selene	172	" No one really believes it , but everyone part - believes it . You see , it 's not really eternal and it must stop some time . As a matter of fact , the rate of drip is only about a third of what it was when it was first discovered , so that it is slowly drying . I imagine people feel that if it happened to stop when they were actually here , they would share in the bad fortune . At least , that 's the rational way of explaining their reluctance to come here . "
97300	97311	97190	97190	Denison	198	" I take it that you do n't believe this . "
97312	97376	97190	97190	Denison	198	" Whether I believe it or not is n't the point . You see I 'm quite certain that it wo n't stop sharply enough for anyone to be able to take the blame . It will just drip slower and slower and slower and no one will ever be able to pinpoint the exact time when it stopped . So why worry ? "
97377	97383	97193	97193	Selene	172	" I agree with you . "
97384	97390	97391	97391	she	172	" I do , however , "
97399	97418	97419	97419	She	172	" have other worries , and I 'd like to discuss them with you while we 're alone . "
97433	97443	97419	97419	She	172	" Which is why you really brought me here ? "
97457	97499	97454	97454	She	172	" See , you can look at me easily now . You 're getting used to me . . . . And , really , there were surely times on Earth when near nudity was n't something to be exclaimed over . "
97501	97506	97508	97508	Denison	198	" Times and places , "
97510	97524	97454	97454	She	172	" but not since the passing of the Crisis . In my lifetime — "
97525	97545	97454	97454	She	172	" Well , on the Moon , do as the Lunarites do is a good enough guide for behavior . "
97546	97569	97454	97454	She	172	" Are you going to tell me why you really brought me here ? Or shall I suspect you of planning seduction ? "
97570	97636	97637	97637	She	1510	" I could carry through seduction quite comfortably at home , thank you . This is different . The surface would have been best , but getting ready to go out on the surface would have attracted a great deal of attention . Coming here did n't , and this place is the only spot in town where we can be reasonably safe from interruption . "
97640	97643	97645	97645	Denison	198	" Well ? "
97647	97658	97645	97645	Denison	198	" Barron is angry . Very angry , in fact . "
97659	97694	97454	97454	She	172	" I 'm not surprised . I warned you he would be if you told him that I knew you were an Intuitionist . Why did you feel it so necessary to tell him ? "
97695	97723	97454	97454	She	172	" Because it is difficult to keep things for long from my — companion . Probably , though , he does n't consider me that any longer . "
97724	97729	97645	97645	Denison	198	" I 'm sorry . "
97730	97773	97454	97454	She	172	" Oh , it was turning sour anyway . It 's lasted long enough . What bothers me more — much more — is that he violently refuses to accept your interpretation of the Pionizer experiments you ran after the surface observations . "
97774	97784	97454	97454	She	172	" I told you the way it would be . "
97785	97794	97454	97454	She	172	" He said he had seen your results . "
97795	97803	97645	97645	Denison	198	" He glanced at them and grunted . "
97804	97819	97454	97454	She	172	" It 's rather disillusioning . Does everyone just believe what he wants to ? "
97820	97829	97454	97454	She	172	" As long as possible . Sometimes longer . "
97830	97835	97645	97645	Denison	198	" What about you ? "
97836	97887	97454	97454	She	172	" You mean , am I human ? Certainly . I do n't believe I 'm really old . I believe I 'm quite attractive . I believe you seek out my company because you think I 'm charming — even when you insist on turning the conversation to physics . "
97888	97895	97454	97454	She	172	" No ! I mean it ! "
97897	97953	97454	97454	She	172	" Well , I suspect Neville told you that the data I had gathered were not significant beyond the margin of error , which makes them doubtful , and that 's true enough . . . . And yet I prefer to believe they have the meaning I expected them to have to begin with . "
97954	97963	97454	97454	She	172	" Just because you want to believe that ? "
97964	98036	97454	97454	She	172	" Not just because . Look at it this way . Suppose there is no harm in the Pump , but that I insist on thinking there is harm . In that case , I will turn out to be a fool and my scientific reputation will be badly damaged . But I am a fool in the eyes of the people who count , and I have no scientific reputation . "
98037	98062	97454	97454	She	172	" Why is that , Ben ? You 've hinted around the tale several times . Ca n't you tell me the whole story ? "
98063	98140	97454	97454	She	172	" You 'd be surprised how little there is to tell . At the age of twenty - five I was still such a child that I had to amuse myself by insulting a fool for no reason other than that he was a fool . Since his folly was not his fault , I was the greater fool to do it . My insult drove him to heights he could n't possibly have scaled otherwise — "
98141	98148	97454	97454	She	172	" You 're talking of Hallam ? "
98149	98174	97454	97454	She	172	" Yes , of course . And as he rose , I fell . And eventually , it dropped me to — the Moon . "
98175	98181	97454	97454	She	172	" Is that so bad ? "
98182	98322	97454	97454	She	172	" No , I rather think it 's good . So let 's say he did me a favor , long - way round . . . . And let 's get back to what I 'm talking about . I 've just explained that if I believe the Pump to be harmful and am wrong , I lose nothing . On the other hand , if I believe the Pump to be harmless and am wrong , I will be helping to destroy the world . To be sure , I 've lived most of my life already and I suppose I can argue myself into believing that I have no great cause to love humanity . However , only a few people have hurt me , and if I hurt everyone in return that is unconscionable usury . "

100343	100348	100349	100349	she	1555	" Or then again , "
100353	100448	100349	100349	she	1555	" suppose it 's the electromagnetic field they detect . The electromagnetic field of a planet is much larger than the planet itself and is much easier to locate . And that would mean that while they can detect the Earth , they ca n't detect the Moon , which has no electromagnetic field to speak of . That 's why , perhaps , we 've failed to set up a Pump Station on the Moon . And , if their small planets lack a significant electromagnetic field , we ca n't locate them . "
100452	100459	100349	100349	she	1555	" It 's an attractive thought . "
100460	100591	100349	100349	she	1555	" Next , consider the inter - Universal exchange in properties that serves to weaken their strong nuclear interaction , cooling their Suns , while strengthening ours , heating and exploding our Suns . What might that imply ? Suppose they can collect energy one - way without our help but only at ruinously low efficiencies . Under ordinary circumstances that would therefore be utterly impractical . They would need us to help direct concentrated energy in their direction by supplying tungsten-186 to them and ac- 254 cepting plutonium-186 in return . But suppose our Galactic arm implodes into a quasar . That would produce an energy concentration in the neighborhood of the Solar system enormously greater than now exists and one that might persist for over a million years . "

102574	102653	102761	102761	Denison	198	" This sort of thing does happen sometime . At least , there are Immies who say they experience no homesickness . They 're in the minority , of course , and no one has ever been able to decide what this minority has in common . Guesses run all the way from serious emotional deficiency , no capacity to feel anything ; to serious emotional excess , a fear to admit homesickness lest it lead to breakdown . "
102654	102714	102722	102722	Selene	172	" In my case , I think it 's plain enough . Life on Earth was not very enjoyable for two decades and more , while here I work at last in a field I have made my own . And I have your help . . . . More than that , Selene , I have your company . "
102715	102720	102722	102722	Selene	172	" You are kind , "
102726	102760	102761	102761	Denison	198	" to place company and help in the relationship you do . You do n't seem to need much help . Do you pretend to seek it for the sake of my company ? "
102765	102777	102761	102761	Denison	198	" I 'm not sure which answer would flatter you more . "
102778	102783	102801	102801	He	198	" Try the truth . "
102784	102800	102801	102801	He	198	" The truth is not so easy to determine when I value each so much . "
102808	102817	102826	102826	She	1589	" The field intensity still holds , Selene . "
102829	102955	102964	102964	Denison	198	" Barron says that non - homesickness is natural and the sign of a healthy mind . He says that though the human body was adapted to Earth 's surface and requires adjustment to the Moon , the human brain was not and does not . The human brain is so different , qualitatively , from all other brains that it can be considered a new phenomenon . It has had no time to be really fixed to Earth 's surface and can , without adjustment , fit other environments . He says that enclosure in the caverns of the Moon may actually suit it best of all , for that is but a larger version of its enclosure in the cavern of the skull . "
102956	102962	102964	102964	Denison	198	" Do you believe that ? "
102968	102981	103027	103027	he	198	" When Barron talks , he can make things sound very plausible . "
102983	103026	103079	103079	Selene	172	" I think it can be made equally plausible to claim that the comfort to be found in the caverns of the Moon is the result of the fulfillment of the return - to - the - womb fantasy . In fact , "
103032	103078	103079	103079	Selene	172	" considering the controlled temperature and pressure , the nature and digestibility of the food , I could make a good case for considering the Lunar colony — I beg your pardon , Selene — the Lunar city a deliberate reconstruction of the fetal environment . "
103082	103096	103107	103107	Denison	198	" I do n't think Barron would agree with you for a minute . "
103097	103105	103213	103213	She	172	" I 'm sure he would n't , "
103216	103275	103213	103213	She	172	" The Earth does shift slightly in the sky because of the Moon 's libration and every once in a while a shaft of Earthlight tops a small rise and falls on a bit of soil beyond . It comes into view like a tiny puff of rising dust . It 's common . We pay no attention . "
103280	103295	103213	103213	She	172	" But it could be a metorite sometimes . Do n't meteorites ever strike ? "
103296	103319	103213	103213	She	172	" Of course they do . You 're probably hit by several every time you 're out . Your suit protects you . "
103320	103348	103213	103213	She	172	" I do n't mean micro - dust particles . I mean sizable meteorites that would really kick up the dust . Meteorites that could kill you . "
103349	103374	103856	103856	Gottstein	183	" Well , they fall , too , but they are few and the Moon is large . No one has been hit yet . "
103510	103515	103856	103856	Gottstein	183	" Commissioner Gottstein here , "
103521	103531	103539	103539	Denison	198	" as you can probably tell from my wobble . "
103532	103537	103539	103539	Denison	198	" Ben Denison here , "
103541	103549	103856	103856	Gottstein	183	" Yes . I thought as much . "
103550	103559	103856	103856	Gottstein	183	" Have you come here looking for me ? "
103560	103563	103539	103539	Denison	198	" Certainly . "
103564	103574	103581	103581	Gottstein	183	" In a space - skipper ? You might — "
103575	103579	103539	103539	Denison	198	" I might , "
103583	103612	103856	103856	Gottstein	183	" have used Outlet P-4 , which is less than a thousand yards from here . Yes , indeed . But I was n't looking only for you . "
103613	103628	103856	103856	Gottstein	183	" Well , I wo n't ask for the meaning of what you say . "
103629	103664	103539	103539	Denison	198	" There 's no reason for me to be coy . Surely you have not expected me to be uninterested in the fact that you have been carrying on experiments on the Lunar surface . "
103665	103677	103856	103856	Gottstein	183	" It 's been no secret and anyone might be interested . "
103678	103710	103856	103856	Gottstein	183	" Yet no one seems to know the details of the experiments . Except , of course , that in some way you are working on matters concerning the Electron Pump . "
103711	103718	103539	103539	Denison	198	" It 's a reasonable assumption . "
103719	103819	103856	103856	Gottstein	183	" Is it ? It seemed to me that experiments of such a nature , to have any value at all , would require a rather enormous setup . This is not of my own knowledge , you understand . I consulted those who would know . And , it is quite obvious , you are not work- 262 ing on such a setup . It occurred to me , therefore , that you might not be the proper focus of my interest . While my attention was drawn to you , others might be undertaking more important tasks . "
103820	103829	103856	103856	Gottstein	183	" Why should I be used as distraction ? "
103830	103846	103856	103856	Gottstein	183	" I do n't know . If I knew , I would be less concerned . "
103847	103855	103856	103856	Gottstein	183	" So I have been under observation . "
103859	103925	103856	103856	Gottstein	183	" That , yes . Since you have arrived . But while you have been working here on the surface , we have observed this entire region for miles in every direction . Oddly enough , it would seem that you , Dr. Denison , and your companion , are the only ones on the Lunar surface for any but the most routine of purposes . "
103926	103932	103856	103856	Gottstein	183	" Why is that odd ? "
103933	103982	103856	103856	Gottstein	183	" Because it means that you really think you 're doing something with your gimcrack contraption , whatever it is . I ca n't believe that you are incompetent , so I think it would be worth listening to you if you tell me what you are doing . "
103983	104016	103856	103856	Gottstein	183	" I am experimenting in para - physics , Commissioner , precisely as rumor has it . To which I can add that so far my experiments have been only partly successful . "
104017	104033	103856	103856	Gottstein	183	" Your companion is , I imagine , Selene Lindstrom L. , a tourist guide . "
104034	104037	103856	103856	Gottstein	183	" Yes . "
104038	104046	103856	103856	Gottstein	183	" An unusual choice as an assistant . "
104047	104060	103856	103856	Gottstein	183	" She is intelligent , eager , interested , and extremely attractive . "
104061	104070	103856	103856	Gottstein	183	" And willing to work with an Earthman ? "
104071	104095	104101	104101	Her	172	" And quite willing to work with an Immigrant who will be a Lunar citizen as soon as he qualifies for that status . "
104108	104143	104144	104144	Gottstein	183	" Good day , Commissioner . I would have liked not to overhear , and intrude on a private conversation , but , in a spacesuit , overhearing is inevitable anywhere within the horizon . "
104147	104170	104101	104101	Her	172	" Hello , Miss Lindstrom . I did not expect to talk in secrecy . Are you interested in para - physics ? "
104172	104177	104144	104144	Gottstein	183	" Oh , yes . "
104178	104190	104199	104199	she	172	" You are not disheartened by the failures of the experiment . "
104191	104198	104199	104199	she	172	" They are not entirely failures , "
104202	104215	104144	104144	Gottstein	183	" They are less a failure than Dr. Denison thinks at present . "
104216	104219	104264	104264	Selene	172	" What ? "
104267	104294	104299	104299	Denison	198	" I raised the intensity of the magnetic field , and the nuclear field remained stable , in being — then eased further and further and — "
104295	104298	104314	104314	Selene	172	" Leaked ! "
104302	104313	104314	104314	Selene	172	" Damn it . I did n't see it happen . "
104317	104351	104367	104367	Denison	198	" I 'm sorry , Ben . First you were lost in your own thoughts , then the Commissioner arrived , and I could n't resist the chance of trying on my own . "
104355	104366	104367	104367	Denison	198	" But just what is it that I see there ? "
104370	104385	104448	104448	She	172	" Energy being spontaneously given off by matter leaking from another Universe into ours . "
104451	104463	104473	104473	Denison	198	" The leak - point is n't stable , you see . "
104464	104471	104473	104473	Denison	198	" Not on a small scale , "
104475	104508	104516	104516	Selene	172	" but considering that a shift of a light - year is as theoretically possible as a shift of a hundred yards , one of a hundred yards only is miraculous stability . "
104509	104514	104520	104520	Gottstein	183	" Not miraculous enough , "
104523	104555	104566	104566	Denison	198	" Let me guess what you 're talking about . You mean that the matter can leak through here , or there , or anywhere in our Universe — at random . "
104556	104564	104520	104520	Gottstein	183	" Not quite at random , Commissioner , "
104568	104632	104653	104653	Denison	198	" The probability of leakage drops with distance from the Pionizer , and 264 rather sharply I should say . The sharpness depends on a variety of factors and I think we 've tightened the situation remarkably . Even so , a flip of a few hundred yards is quite probable and , as a matter of fact , you saw it happen . "
104633	104652	104653	104653	Denison	198	" And it might have shifted to somewhere within the city or within our own helmets , perhaps . "
104658	104763	104815	104815	Gottstein	183	" No , no . The leak , at least by the techniques we use , is heavily dependent on the density of matter already present in this Universe . The chances are virtually nil that the leak - position would shift from a place of essential vacuum to one where an atmosphere even a hundredth as dense as that within the city or within our helmets would exist . It would be impractical to expect to arrange the leak anywhere but into a vacuum in the first place , which is why we had to make the attempt up here on the surface . "
104764	104774	104782	104782	Denison	198	" Then this is not like the Electron Pump ? "
104775	104780	104815	104815	Gottstein	183	" Not at all , "
104784	104814	104815	104815	Gottstein	183	" In the Electron Pump there is a two - way transfer of matter , here a one - way leak . Nor are the Universes involved the same . "
104818	104834	104835	104835	Denison	198	" I wonder if you would have dinner with me this evening , Dr. Denison ? "
104838	104842	104862	104862	his	183	" Myself only ? "
104865	104894	104903	104903	Selene	172	" I would be charmed to have Miss Lindstrom 's company on another occasion , but on this one I must speak with you alone , Dr. Denison . "
104895	104901	104935	104935	Denison	198	" Oh , go ahead , "
104912	104934	104935	104935	Denison	198	" I have a heavy schedule tomorrow anyway and you 'll need time to worry about the leak - point instability . "
104940	104959	104862	104862	his	183	" Well , then — Selene , will you let me know when your next free day is ? "
104960	104998	105109	105109	He	182	" I always do , do n't I ? And we 'll be in touch before then anyway . . . . Why do n't you two go on ? I 'll take care of the equipment . "
105063	105079	105087	105087	Selene	172	" Then you 're positive it works . Right , Selene ? You 're positive ? "
105080	105085	105087	105087	Selene	172	" I 'm positive , "
105089	105100	105109	105109	He	182	" I 've told you five times by actual count . "
105118	105139	105109	105109	He	182	" It does n't matter that Gottstein was there , then ? He did n't try to stop the experiment ? "
105140	105147	105109	105109	He	182	" No . Of course not . "
105148	105161	105109	105109	He	182	" There was no indication that he would try to exert authority — "
105162	105194	105195	105195	Neville	182	" Now , Barron , what kind of authority could he exert ? Will Earth send a police force ? Besides — oh , you know they ca n't stop us . "
105205	105217	105109	105109	He	182	" They do n't know ? They still do n't know ? "
105218	105260	105281	105281	her	172	" Of course they do n't . Ben was looking at the stars and then Gottstein came . So I tried for the field - leak , got it , and I had already gotten the other . Ben 's setup — "
105261	105278	105281	105281	her	172	" Do n't call it his setup . It was your idea , was n't it ? "
105284	105296	105109	105109	He	182	" I made vague suggestions . The details were Ben 's . "
105297	105325	105109	105109	He	182	" But you can reproduce it now . For Luna 's sake , we do n't have to go to the Earthie for it , do we ? "
105326	105345	105281	105281	her	172	" I think I can reproduce enough of it now so that our people can fill it in . "
105346	105357	105109	105109	He	182	" All right , then . Let 's get started . "
105359	105373	105109	105109	He	182	" Not yet . Oh , damn it , Barron , not yet . "
105374	105379	105281	105281	her	172	" Why not yet ? "
105380	105388	105109	105109	He	182	" We need the energy , too . "
105389	105395	105109	105109	He	182	" But we have that . "
105396	105411	105281	105281	her	172	" Not quite . The leak - point is unstable ; pretty badly unstable . "
105412	105424	105109	105109	He	182	" But that can be fixed up . You said so . "
105425	105433	105109	105109	He	182	" I said I thought it could . "
105434	105442	105281	105281	her	172	" That 's good enough for me . "
105443	105463	105497	105497	Selene	172	" Just the same , it would be better to have Ben work out the details and stabilize it . "
105482	105496	105497	105497	Selene	172	" You do n't think I can do it ? Is that it ? "
105500	105515	105521	105521	Neville	182	" Will you come out on the surface with me and work on it ? "
105526	105545	105521	105521	Neville	182	" I do n't appreciate your sarcasm . And I do n't want to have to wait long . "
105546	105587	105657	105657	Gottstein	183	" I ca n't command the laws of nature . But I think it wo n't be long . . . . Now if you do n't mind , I need my sleep . I 've got my tourists tomorrow . "
105646	105655	105681	105681	Denison	198	" I had hoped , to be frank , "
105670	105680	105681	105681	Denison	198	concoction—"that we would have seen each other more often . "
105684	105729	105797	105797	Denison	198	" It is kind of you to take such an interest in my work . If the leak - instability can be corrected , I think my achieve- 267 ment — and that of Miss Lindstrom — will have been a most significant one . "
105730	105789	105797	105797	Denison	198	" You speak carefully , like a scientist . ... I wo n't insult you by offering the Lunar equivalent of a liqueur ; that is the one approximation to Earth 's cuisine I have simply made up my mind not to tolerate . Can you tell me , in lay language , what makes the achievement significant ? "
105790	105795	105797	105797	Denison	198	" I can try , "
105801	105873	106028	106028	I	0	" Suppose we start with the para - Universe . It has a more intense strong nuclear interaction than our Universe has so that relatively small masses of protons in the para - Universe can undergo the fusion reaction capable of supporting a star . Masses equivalent to our stars would explode violently in the para - Universe which has many more , but much smaller , stars than ours does . "

106946	106956	107089	107090	the terminuses	1619	" What about the change in our own Universe ? "
106957	106973	107089	107090	the terminuses	1619	" The strong interaction weakens . Slowly , very slowly , our Sun cools off . "
106975	106987	106999	106999	Denison	198	" Can we use cosmeg energy to make up for that ? "
106988	106997	106999	106999	Denison	198	" That would not be necessary , Commissioner , "
107003	107080	107208	107208	You	1622	" While the strong interaction here in our Universe weakens as a result of the cosmeg pump , it strengthens through the action of the ordinary Electron Pump . If we adjust the energy productions of the two then , though the laws of nature change in the cosmeg - Universe and in the para - Universe , they do not change in ours . We are a highway but not the terminus in either direction . "
107169	107207	107299	107299	you	198	" For a while , Gottstein said nothing . His plump face , in repose , seemed emotionless . He nodded to himself as though following the line of his own thoughts . Finally , he said , "
107245	107249	107280	107280	you	198	" Denison said , "
107276	107277	107299	107299	you	198	" "

107494	107514	107524	107524	We	1629	" Denison looked down and brushed his hand thoughtfully over the weave of his pants leg . He said , "
107537	107538	107524	107524	We	1629	" "
107544	107545	107642	107642	we	1629	" "

107748	107752	107758	107759	Miss Lindstrom	180	" Gottstein smiled . "
107761	107762	107828	107829	Dr. Denison	198	" "
107783	107823	107828	107829	Dr. Denison	198	" 272 Gottstein rose , stretched , and then jumped in place two or three times in the eerily slow fashion imposed by Lunar gravity . He flexed his knees each time . He sat down again and said , "
107831	107837	107901	107902	Dr. Denison	198	" Denison shook his head . "
107904	107913	107916	107916	her	180	" Denison said in a quite changed tone , "
107918	107919	107920	107920	She	180	" "

107971	107979	108026	108026	she	180	" . Gottstein was no longer smiling . "
108031	108035	108059	108059	I	0	" Denison said , "

108124	108128	108137	108137	Her	180	" Denison hesitated . "

108699	108716	108863	108863	I	0	" For a moment , the silence was heavy between them . Then the Commissioner said , "
108775	108790	108797	108798	Miss Lindstrom	180	" It was a clear dismissal . Denison rose and the Commissioner said easily , "
108800	108862	108865	108865	we	1658	" 17 It was a heavier star of radiation , a fatter one , a brighter one . Denison could feel its warmth on his faceplate , and backed away . There was a distinct x - ray component in the radiation and though this shielding should take care of that there was no point in placing it under a strain . "
108871	108875	108885	108885	I	0	" he muttered . "
108883	108884	108885	108885	I	0	" "
108891	108897	108966	108966	I	0	" said Selene , flatly . "
108911	108965	108966	108966	I	0	" They moved slowly and Denison felt oddly dispirited . There was no uncertainty any more ; no excitement . From this point on , 275 there was no chance of failure . The government was interested ; more and more , it would be out of his own hands . He said , "
108975	108976	108977	108977	I	0	" "
108981	108987	108989	108989	you	0	" said Selene , carefully . "

109121	109132	109141	109141	I	0	" Denison shrugged , a useless maneuver inside his spacesuit . "

109144	109171	109141	109141	I	0	" said Selene , softly . Denison did not respond directly . He shoved the Pionizer and its attendant apparatus into its rocky shelter and said , "
109174	109175	109141	109141	I	0	" "
109178	109253	109255	109255	you	0	" They slipped into the surface entrance at Outlet P-4 in silence and Denison climbed down the entry ladder . Selene dropped past him , braking in quick holds at individual rungs . Denison had learned to do that , but he was dispirited and climbed down in a kind of rebellious refusal to accept acclimation . They removed their suits in the staging areas , placed them in their lockers . Denison said , "
109263	109268	109281	109281	I	0	" Selene said uneasily , "

109293	109307	109349	109349	Ben	198	" 276 They ate in Selene 's quarters . She insisted , saying , "
109325	109348	109359	109359	you	0	" And when Denison was chewing slowly at something that had a faint resemblance to peanut - flavored veal , she said , "
109368	109369	109372	109372	I	0	" "
109376	109382	109385	109385	you	0	" said Denison , frowning . "
109388	109397	109416	109416	you	0	" She looked into his eyes with concern . "
109424	109428	109465	109465	they	1664	" Denison shrugged . "

110026	110046	110047	110047	I	0	" There was a pause and Denison 's smile faded , then returned , perhaps a thought more mechanically . "
110054	110079	110097	110097	you	172	" Denison looked away , shook his head slightly , then turned back . She watched him carefully , almost anxiously . Denison said , "
110104	110118	110097	110097	you	172	" The silence stretched out now , painfully , and finally Selene said , "
110123	110146	110194	110194	I	0	" For a while the two stared at each other — Denison embarrassed , Selene almost furtive . 278 18 Gottstein said , "

110203	110207	110226	110226	Hallam	92	" said Denison . "
110228	110234	110253	110253	Lamont	91	" Denison said , wistfully , "

110358	110372	110354	110354	I	0	" Denison 's face , from initial confusion , suddenly lit with comprehension . "

110395	110398	110469	110470	The Commissioner	2476	" No ? "
110399	110468	110480	110480	He	2476	" No ! If I taste real chocolate then , for the few minutes it 's in my mouth , I 'm going to miss Earth ; I 'm going to miss everything about it . I ca n't afford that . I do n't want it . . . . Do n't even show it to me . Do n't let me smell it or see it . "
110474	110479	110480	110480	He	2476	" You 're right . "
110491	110531	110545	110545	Denison	198	" The excitement on Earth is overwhelming . Of course , we made a considerable effort to save Hallam 's face . He 'll continue to hold some position of importance , but he 'll have little real say . "
110532	110543	110545	110545	Denison	198	" He 's getting more consideration than he gave others , "
110549	110595	110606	110606	Denison	198	" It 's not for his sake . You ca n't smash a personal image that has been built to a level of such importance ; it would reflect on science itself . The good name of science is more important than Hallam either way . "
110596	110604	110606	110606	Denison	198	" I disapprove of that in principle , "
110610	110619	110635	110635	his	183	" Science must take what blows it deserves . "
110620	110632	110690	110691	The Commissioner	2476	" A time and place for — There 's Dr. Neville . "
110694	110731	110741	110741	Neville	182	" I am glad to see you , Dr. Neville . Dr. Denison tells me that you refused to append your name to what I am sure will be a classic paper on the cosmeg pump . "
110732	110739	110741	110741	Neville	182	" No need to do so , "
110743	110755	110690	110691	The Commissioner	2476	" What happens on Earth is of no interest to me . "
110756	110770	110690	110691	The Commissioner	2476	" You are aware of the cosmeg pump experiments ? Of its implications ? "
110771	110787	110912	110912	Denison	198	" All of them . I know the situation as well as you two do . "
110788	110911	110949	110949	Neville	182	" Then I will proceed without preliminaries . I have returned from Earth , Dr. Neville , and it is quite settled as to what will be the course of future procedure . Large cosmeg pump stations will be set up on three different places on the Lunar surface in such a way that one will always be in the night - shadow . Half the time , two will be . Those in the night - shadow will be constantly generating energy , most of which will simply radiate into space . The purpose will be not so much to use the energy 280 for practical purposes , as to counteract the changes in field intensities introduced by the Electron Pump . "
110915	110948	110949	110949	Neville	182	" For some years , we will have to overbalance the Electron Pump to restore our section of the Universe to the point at which it was before the pump began operation . "
110952	110964	110912	110912	Denison	198	" Will Luna City have the use of any of it ? "
110965	110989	110999	110999	Neville	182	" If necessary . We feel the Solar batteries will probably supply what you need , but there is no objection to supplementation . "
110990	110997	110999	110999	Neville	182	" That is kind of you , "
111008	111020	111030	111030	Gottstein	183	" And who will build and run the cosmeg pump stations ? "
111021	111028	111041	111041	Neville	182	" Lunar workers , we hope , "
111032	111039	111041	111041	Neville	182	" Lunar workers , you know , "
111043	111057	111065	111065	Gottstein	183	" Earth workers would be too clumsy to work effectively on the Moon . "
111058	111063	111065	111065	Gottstein	183	" We recognize that , "
111067	111078	111110	111110	Gottstein	183	" We trust the men of the Moon will cooperate . "
111079	111109	111129	111129	Neville	182	" And who will decide how much energy to generate , how much to apply for any local purpose , how much to radiate away ? Who decides policy ? "
111113	111128	111129	111129	Neville	182	" The government would have to . It 's a matter of planetary decision . "
111132	111153	111154	111154	Gottstein	183	" You see , then , it will be Moonmen who do the work ; Earthmen who run the show . "
111159	111182	111191	111191	Neville	182	" No . All of us work who work best ; all of us administer who can best weigh the total problem . "
111183	111189	111191	111191	Neville	182	" I hear the words , "
111193	111218	111154	111154	Gottstein	183	" but it boils down anyway to us working and you deciding . . . . No , Commissioner . The answer is no . "
111219	111231	111154	111154	Gottstein	183	" You mean you wo n't build the cosmeg pump stations ? "
111232	111263	111191	111191	Neville	182	" We 'll build them , Commissioner , but they 'll be ours . We 'll decide how much energy to put out and what use to make of it . "
111264	111295	111339	111339	Denison	198	" That would scarcely be efficient . You would have to deal constantly with the Earth government since the cosmeg pump energy will have to balance the Electron Pump energy . "
111296	111338	111339	111339	Denison	198	" I dare say it will , more or less , but we have other things in 281 mind . You might as well know now . Energy is not the only conserved phenomenon that becomes limitless once universes are crossed . "
111342	111355	111365	111365	Neville	182	" There are a number of conservation laws . We realize that . "
111356	111363	111365	111365	Neville	182	" I 'm glad you do , "
111375	111454	111463	111463	Denison	198	" They include those of linear momentum and angular momentum . As long as any object responds to the gravitational field in which it is immersed , and to that only , it is in free fall and can retain its mass . In order to move in any other way than free fall , it must accelerate in a non - gravitational way and for that to happen , part of itself must undergo an opposite change . "
111455	111461	111463	111463	Denison	198	" As in a rocketship , "
111465	111485	111498	111498	Neville	182	" which must eject mass in one direction in order that the rest might accelerate in the opposite direction . "
111486	111496	111498	111498	Neville	182	" I 'm sure you understand , Dr. Denison , "
111500	111580	111587	111587	Gottstein	183	" but I explain for the Commissioner 's sake . The loss of mass can be minimized if its velocity is increased enormously , since momentum is equal to mass multiplied by velocity . Nevertheless , however great the velocity , some mass must be thrown away . If the mass which must be accelerated is enormous in the first place , then the mass which must be discarded is also enormous . If the Moon , for instance — "
111581	111585	111599	111599	Neville	182	" The Moon ! "
111591	111597	111599	111599	Neville	182	" Yes , the Moon , "
111603	111696	111498	111498	Neville	182	" If the Moon were to be driven out of its orbit and sent out of the Solar system , the conservation of momentum would make it a colossal undertaking , and probably a thoroughly impractical one . If , however , momentum could be transferred to the cosmeg in another Universe , the Moon could accelerate at any convenient rate without loss of mass at all . It would be like poling a barge upstream , to give you a picture I obtained from some Earth - book I once read . "
111697	111712	111850	111850	Denison	198	" But why ? I mean why should you want to move the Moon ? "
111713	111849	111850	111850	Denison	198	" I should think that would be obvious . Why do we need the 282 suffocating presence of the Earth ? We have the energy we need ; we have a comfortable world through which we have room to expand for the next few centuries , at least . Why not go our own way ? In any case , we will . I have come to tell you that you can not stop us and to urge you to make no attempt to interfere . We shall transfer momentum and we shall pull out . We of the Moon know precisely how to go about building cosmeg pump stations . We will use what energy we need for ourselves and produce excess in order to neutralize the changes your own power stations are producing . "
111855	111910	111916	111916	Neville	182	" It sounds kind of you to produce excess for our sake , but it is n't for our sake , of course . If our Electron Pumps explode the Sun , that will happen long before you can move out of even the inner Solar system and you will vaporize wherever you are . "
111911	111914	111916	111916	Neville	182	" Perhaps , "
111918	111935	111946	111946	Gottstein	183	" but in any case we will produce an excess , so that wo n't happen . "
111936	111944	111980	111980	Denison	198	" But you ca n't do that , "
111950	111979	112077	112077	Neville	182	" You ca n't move out . If you get out too far , the cosmeg pump will no longer neutralize the Electron Pump , eh , Denison ? "
111983	112076	112077	112077	Neville	182	" Once they are as far off as Saturn , more or less , there may be trouble , if I may trust a mental calculation I have just made . It will , however , be many years before they recede to such a distance and by that time , we will surely have constructed space stations in what was once the orbit of the Moon and place cosmeg pumps on them . Actually , we do n't need the Moon . It can leave — except that it wo n't . "
112081	112108	111916	111916	Neville	182	" What makes you think we wo n't ? We ca n't be stopped . There is no way Earthmen can impose their will on us . "
112109	112238	112077	112077	Neville	182	" You wo n't leave , because there 's no sense to doing so . Why drag the entire Moon away ? To build up respectable accelerations will take years where the Moon - mass is concerned . You 'll creep . Build starships instead ; miles - long ships that are cosmeg - powered and have independent ecologies . With a cosmeg momentumdrive , you can then do wonders . If it takes twenty years to 283 build the ships , they will nevertheless accelerate at a rate that will enable them to overtake the Moon 's place within a year even if the Moon starts accelerating today . The ships will be able to change course in a tiny fraction of the time the Moon will . "
112239	112254	112328	112328	Neville	182	" And the unbalanced cosmeg pumps ? What will that do to the Universe . "
112255	112327	112349	112349	Denison	198	" The energy required by a ship , or even by a number , will be far less than that required by a planet and will be distributed throughout large sections of the Universe . It will be millions of years before any significant change takes place . That is well worth the maneuverability you gain . The Moon will move so slowly it might as well be left in space . "
112333	112348	112349	112349	Denison	198	" We 're in no hurry to get anywhere — except away from Earth . "
112352	112399	112077	112077	Neville	182	" There are advantages in having Earth as a neighbor . You have the influx of the Immigrants . You have cultural intercourse . You have a planetary world of two billion people just over the horizon . Do you want to give all that up ? "
112400	112403	112328	112328	Neville	182	" Gladly . "
112404	112562	112349	112349	Denison	198	" Is that true of the people of the Moon generally ? Or just of you ? There 's something intense about you , Neville . You wo n't go out on the surface . Other Lunarites do . They do n't like it particularly , but they do . The interior of the Moon is n't their womb , as it is in your case . It is n't their prison , as it is yours . There is a neurotic factor in you that is absent in most Lunarites , or at least considerably weaker . If you take the Moon away from Earth , you make it into a prison for all . It will become a one - world prison from which no man — and not you only — can emerge , not even to the extent of seeing another inhabited world in the sky . Perhaps that is what you want . "
112563	112579	112077	112077	Neville	182	" I want independence ; a free world ; a world untouched by the outside . "
112580	112632	112638	112638	Neville	182	" You can build ships , any number . You can move outward at near - light velocities without difficulty , once you transfer 284 momentum to the cosmeg . You can explore the entire Universe in a single lifetime . Would n't you like to get on such a ship ? "
112633	112636	112638	112638	Neville	182	" No , "
112644	112678	112693	112693	Neville	182	" Would n't you ? Or is it could n't ? Is it that you must take the Moon with you wherever you go ? Why must all the others accept your need ? "
112679	112691	112695	112695	Denison	198	" Because that 's the way it 's going to be , "
112705	112730	112077	112077	Neville	182	" Who gave you the right to say that ? There are many citizens of Luna City who may not feel as you do . "
112731	112739	112695	112695	Denison	198	" That is none of your concern . "
112740	112833	112842	112842	Neville	182	" That is precisely my concern . I am an Immigrant who will qualify for citizenship soon . I do not wish to have my choice made for me by someone who can not emerge on the surface and who wants his personal prison made into a prison for all . I have left Earth forever , but only to come to the Moon , only to remain a quarter - million miles from the home - planet . I have not contracted to be taken forever away for an unlimited distance . "
112834	112840	112842	112842	Neville	182	" Then return to Earth , "
112846	112852	112695	112695	Denison	198	" There is still time . "
112853	112867	112695	112695	Denison	198	" And what of the other citizens of Luna ? The other Immigrants ? "
112868	112874	112887	112887	Selene	172	" The decision is made . "
112875	112886	112914	112914	Neville	182	" It is not made . . . . Selene ! "
112917	112931	112941	112941	she	172	" How long have you been waiting in the next room , Selene ? "
112932	112940	112959	112959	he	182	" Since before you arrived , Barron , "
112954	112958	112988	112988	Selene	172	" You two — "
112972	112986	112988	112988	Selene	172	" I do n't know what you mean by ' you two , ' "
112990	113003	113015	113015	Denison	198	" but Ben found out about the momentum quite a while ago . "
113005	113013	113015	113015	Denison	198	" It was n't Selene 's fault , "
113017	113065	113076	113076	Neville	182	" The Commissioner spotted something flying at a time when no one could possibly have known he would be observing . It seemed to me that Selene might be testing something I was not thinking of and transfer of momentum eventually occurred to me . After that — "
113066	113074	113076	113076	Neville	182	" Well , then , you knew , "
113078	113084	113093	113093	Selene	172	" It does n't matter . "
113085	113091	113093	113093	Selene	172	" It does , Barron , "
113095	113202	113203	113203	Neville	182	" I talked about it with Ben . I found that I did n't always have to accept what you said . Perhaps I ca n't ever go to Earth . Perhaps I do n't even want to . But I found I liked it in the sky where I could see it if I wanted to . I did n't want an empty sky . Then I talked to others of the Group . Not everybody wants to leave . Most people would rather build the ships and let those go who wish to go while allowing those to remain behind who wish to remain . "
113210	113223	113093	113093	Selene	172	" You talked about it . Who gave you the right to — "
113224	113246	113252	113252	Neville	182	" I took the right , Barron . Besides , it does n't matter any more . You 'll be outvoted . "
113247	113251	113265	113266	The Commissioner	2476	" Because of — "
113269	113297	113304	113304	Selene	172	" Please do n't get emotional , Dr. Neville . You may be of Luna , but I do n't think you can manhandle both of us . "
113298	113302	113265	113266	The Commissioner	2476	" All three , "
113306	113324	113326	113326	Denison	198	" and I 'm of Luna , too . I did it , Barron ; not they . "
113329	113420	113455	113455	She	172	" Look , Neville — For all Earth cares , the Moon can go . Earth can build its space stations . It 's the citizens of Luna City who care . Selene cares and I care and the rest . You are not being debarred from space , from escape , from freedom . In twenty years at the outside , all who want to go will go , including you if you can bring yourself to leave the womb . And those who want to stay will stay . "
113458	113474	113423	113423	Neville	182	" The vote did go against him , you know , Ben . Quite heavily . "
113475	113508	113455	113455	She	172	" I doubt that he 'll give up , though . If there 's friction with Earth during the building of the stations , public opinion on the Moon may swing back . "
113509	113516	113455	113455	She	172	" There need n't be friction . "
113517	113582	113423	113423	Neville	182	" No , there need n't . In any case , there are no happy endings in history , only crisis points that pass . We 've passed this one safely , I think , and we 'll worry about the others as they come and as they can be foreseen . Once the starships are built , the tension will surely subside considerably . "
113583	113595	113455	113455	She	172	" We 'll live to see that , I 'm sure . "
113596	113602	113455	113455	She	172	" You will , Selene . "
113603	113623	113423	113423	Neville	182	" You , too , Ben . Do n't overdramatize your age . You 're only forty - eight . "
113624	113636	113455	113455	She	172	" Would you go on one of the starships , Selene ? "
113637	113668	113455	113455	She	172	" No . I 'd be too old and I still would n't want to lose Earth in the sky . My son might go . . . . Ben . "
113669	113674	113695	113695	Denison	198	" Yes , Selene . "
113675	113694	113719	113719	She	1679	" I have applied for a second son . The application has been accepted . Would you contribute ? "
113714	113718	113711	113711	He	198	" Artificial insemination ? "
113722	113736	113751	113751	Selene	172	" Of course . . . . The gene combination should be interesting . "
113742	113750	113751	113751	Selene	172	" I would be flattered , Selene . "
113756	113785	113711	113711	He	198	" That 's just good sense , Ben . It 's 287 important to have good gene combinations . There 's nothing wrong with some natural genetic engineering . "
113786	113791	113751	113751	Selene	172	" None at all . "
113792	113817	113842	113842	Denison	198	" It does n't mean that I do n't want it for other reasons , too . . . . Because I like you . "
113830	113841	113842	113842	Denison	198	" Well , there 's more to love than sex . "
113845	113862	113882	113882	Denison	198	" I agree to that . At least , I love you even with sex subtracted . "
113867	113881	113882	113882	Denison	198	" And for that matter , there 's more to sex than acrobatics . "
113885	113893	113895	113895	Selene	172	" I agree to that , too . "
113898	113913	113914	113914	Denison	198	" And besides — Oh , damn it , you could try to learn . "
113918	113926	None	None	None	None	" If you would try to teach . "
