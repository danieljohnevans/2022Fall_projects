Wild Seed Book I enant 1690 CHAPTER 1 Doro discovered the woman by accident when he went to see what was left of one of his seed villages . The village was a comfortable mud - walled place surrounded by grasslands and scattered trees . But Doro realized even before he reached it that its people were gone . Slavers had been to it before him . With their guns and their greed , they had undone in a few hours the work of a thousand years . Those villagers they had not herded away , they had slaughtered . Doro found human bones , hair , bits of desiccated flesh missed by scavengers . He stood over a very small skeleton — the bones of a childand wondered where the survivors had been taken . Which country or New World colony ? How far would he have to travel to find the remnants of what had been a healthy , vigorous people ? Finally , he stumbled away from the ruins bitterly angry , not knowing or caring where he went . It was a matter of pride with him that he protected his own . Not the individuals , perhaps , but the groups . They gave him their loyalty , their obedience , and he protected them . He had failed . He wandered southwest toward the forest , leaving as he had arrived - alone , unarmed , without supplies , accepting the savanna and later the forest as easily as he accepted any terrain . He was killed several times — by disease , by animals , by hostile people . This was a harsh land . Yet he continued to move southwest , unthinkingly veering away from the section of the coast where his ship awaited him . After a while , he realized it was no longer his anger at the loss of his seed village that drove him . It was something new - an impulse , a feeling , a kind of mental undertow pulling at him . He could have resisted it easily , but he did not . He felt there was something for him farther on , a little farther , just ahead . He trusted such feelings . He had not been this far west for several hundred years , thus he could be certain that whatever , whoever he found would be new to him - new and potentially valuable . He moved on eagerly . Wild Seed The feeling became sharper and finer , resolving itself into a kind of signal he would normally have expected to receive only from people he knew people like his lost villagers whom he should be tracking now before they were forced to mix their seed with foreigners and breed away all the special qualities he valued in them . But he continued on southwest , closing slowly on his quarry . Anyanwu 's ears and eyes were far sharper than those of other people . She had increased their sensitivity deliberately after the first time men came stalking her , their machetes ready , their intentions clear . She had had to kill seven times on that terrible day — seven frightened men who could have been spared — and she had nearly died herself , all because she let people come upon her unnoticed . Never again . Now , for instance , she was very much aware of the lone intruder who prowled the bush near her . He kept himself hidden , moved toward her like smoke , but she heard him , followed him with her ears . Giving no outward sign , she went on tending her garden . As long as she knew where the intruder was , she had no fear of him . Perhaps he would lose his courage and go away . Meanwhile , there were weeds among her coco yams and her herbs . The herbs were not the traditional ones grown or gathered by her people . Only she grew them as medicines for healing , used them when people brought their sick to her . Often she needed no medicines , but she kept that to herself . She served her people by giving them relief from pain and sickness . Also , she enriched them by allowing them to spread word of her abilities to neighboring people . She was an oracle . A woman through whom a god spoke . Strangers paid heavily for her services . They paid her people , then they paid her . That was as it should have been . Her people could see that they benefited from her presence , and that they had reason to fear her abilities . Thus was she protected from them and they from her — most of the time . But now and then one of them overcame his fear and found reason to try to end her long life . The intruder was moving closer , still not allowing her to see him . No person of honest intentions would approach so stealthily . Who was he then ? A thief ? A murderer ? Someone who blamed her for the death of a kinsman or for some other misfortune ? During her various youths , she had been blamed several times for causing misWild Seed fortune . She had been fed poison in the test for witchcraft . Each time , she had taken the test willingly , knowing that she had bewitched no one — and knowing that no ordinary man with his scanty knowledge of poisons could harm her . She knew more about poisons , had ingested more poisons in her long life than any of her people could imagine . Each time she passed the test , her accusers had been ridiculed and fined for their false charges . In each of her lives as she grew older , people ceased to accuse her — though not all ceased to believe she was a witch . Some sought to take matters into their own hands and kill her regardless of the tests . The intruder finally moved onto the narrow path to approach her openly — now that he had had enough of spying on her . She looked up as though becoming aware of him for the first time . He was a stranger , a fine man taller than most and broader at the shoulders . His skin was as dark as her own , and his face was broad and handsome , the mouth slightly smiling . He was young — not yet thirty , she thought . Surely too young to be any threat to her . Yet something about him worried her . His sudden openness after so much stealth , perhaps . Who was he ? What did he want ? When he was near enough , he spoke to her , and his words made her frown in confusion . They were foreign words , completely incomprehensible to her , but there was a strange familiarity to them — as though she should have understood . She stood up , concealing uncharacteristic nervousness . “
1360	1377	1358	1358	you	176	” she asked . He lifted his head slightly as she spoke , seemed to listen . “
1383	1387	1388	1388	You	176	” she asked . “
1402	1403	1396	1396	your	176	” “
1407	1457	1388	1388	You	176	" he said in her own language . His words were clear to her now , though he had an accent that reminded her of the way people spoke long ago when she was truly young . She did not like it . Everything about him made her uneasy . “
1463	1467	1468	1468	I	0	” she said . “
1484	1502	1479	1479	I	0	” He came closer , peering at her . Finally , he smiled and shook his head . “
1512	1516	1503	1503	You	0	” he said . “
1527	1562	1518	1518	you	0	” She drew back in confusion . How could he know anything of what she was ? How could he even guess with nothing more than her appearance and a few words as evidence ? “
1567	1579	1563	1563	I	0	” she said , maskWild Seed ing her fear with anger . “
1588	1608	1580	1580	I	0	” She could have been an ancestor of his mother 's mother . But she kept that to herself . “
1613	1617	1611	1611	you	176	” she demanded . “
1626	1679	1621	1624	your mother 's father	183	” he said . She took another step backward , somehow controlling her growing fear . This man was not what he seemed to be . His words should have come to her as mocking nonsense , but instead , they seemed to reveal as much and as little as her own . "
1683	1688	1689	1689	I	0	” he told her . “
1695	1696	1689	1689	I	0	” “
1701	1705	1706	1706	Doro	60	” she repeated . “
1708	1709	1706	1706	Doro	60	” “
1712	1721	1710	1710	Doro	60	” She said the strange word twice more . “
1727	1728	1710	1710	Doro	60	” "
1751	1760	1710	1710	Doro	60	” She put one hand to her face . “
1766	1770	1771	1771	Someone	185	” she said . “
1775	1776	1771	1771	Someone	185	" “
1790	1818	1783	1783	you	176	” . Not for more years than she could remember ; he was right . But the names . . . The coincidence was like a sign . “
1826	1830	1820	1820	you	176	” she asked . “
1842	1843	1832	1832	you	176	” “
1880	1881	1868	1868	you	176	” “
1884	1885	1886	1886	I	0	” “
1911	1912	1913	1913	I	0	” “
1919	1920	1913	1913	I	0	" "
1942	1943	1944	1944	You	176	” "
1964	1989	1962	1962	Anyanwu	61	” He repeated her name and glanced upward , understanding . Sun , her name meant . Anyanwu : the sun . He nodded . “
2013	2014	2008	2008	they	190	” “
2030	2031	2023	2023	Doro	60	” “
2110	2111	2107	2107	their	184	” "
2121	2125	2114	2114	you	60	" she said . “
2136	2137	2114	2114	you	60	” "
2152	2216	2140	2140	you	0	” He looked around , saw a fallen tree nearby . He went to sit on it . Anyanwu followed almost against her will . As much as this man confused and frightened her , he also intrigued her . It had been so long since something had happened to her that had not happened before many times before . He spoke again . "
2225	2229	2140	2140	you	0	” he said , “
2255	2311	2140	2140	you	0	” She went closer to him and peered down at him . He was clearly proclaiming himself like her — long - lived and powerful . In all her years , she had not known even one other person like herself . She had long ago given up , accepted her solitude . But now ... “
2316	2320	2140	2140	you	0	” she said . “
2328	2453	2321	2321	You	202	” He had been watching her , looking at her eyes with a curiosity that most people tried to hide from her . People said her eyes were like babies ' eyes — the whites too white , the browns too deep and clear . No adult , and certainly no old woman should have such eyes , they said . And they avoided her gaze . Doro 's eyes were very ordinary , but he could stare at her as children stared . He had no fear , and probably no shame . He startled her by taking her hand and pulling her down beside him on the tree trunk . She could have broken his grip easily , but she did not . “
2462	2467	2321	2321	You	202	" he told her . “
2481	2501	2502	2502	I	0	” She thought about that . This body needs rest . What a strange way he had of speaking . "
2514	2518	2502	2502	I	0	" he said . “
2582	2583	2568	2568	you	207	” “
2595	2596	2585	2585	you	0	” “
2599	2632	2585	2585	you	0	” He was examining her face very carefully , perhaps seeking Wild Seed some resemblance . He would not find it . The face she was wearing was not her true face . "
2638	2649	2650	2650	Orumili	64	Niger”_he hesitated , frowning , then gave the river its proper name—“the
2667	2668	2658	2658	they	192	” “
2674	2678	2658	2658	they	192	" she said . “
2723	2724	2719	2721	our own masters	218	” “
2737	2738	2739	2739	Some	2676	” “
2748	2749	2743	2743	Others	221	" “
2767	2775	2758	2758	you	0	” Anyanwu looked away , spoke woodenly . “
2789	2961	2758	2758	you	0	” Her husband at the time of the migration had said that . He had seen himself becoming a great man - master of a large household with many wives , children , and slaves . Anyanwu , on the other hand , had been a slave twice in her life and had escaped only by changing her identity completely and finding a husband in a different town . She knew some people were masters and some were slaves . That was the way it had always been . But her own experience had taught her to hate slavery . She had even found it difficult to be a good wife in her most recent years because of the way a woman must bow her head and be subject to her husband . It was better to be as she was — a priestess who spoke with the voice of a god and was feared and obeyed . But what was that ? She had become a kind of master herself . “
2975	2980	2964	2964	one	227	” she said softly . “
2983	3171	2964	2964	one	227	” he agreed . She deliberately turned her attention to the new things he had given her to think about . Her age , for instance . He was right . She was about three hundred years old — something none of her people would have believed . And he had said something else --- something that brought alive one of her oldest memories . There had been whispers when she was a girl that her father could not beget children , that she was the daughter not only of another man , but of a visiting stranger . She had asked her mother about this , and for the first and only time in her life , her mother had struck her . From then on , she had accepted the story as true . But she had never been able to learn anything about the stranger . She would not have cared - her Wild Seed mother 's husband claimed her as his daughter and he was a good man — but she had always wondered whether the stranger 's people were more like her . “
3177	3182	2964	2964	one	227	” she asked Doro . "
3189	3190	3183	3187	These ... kinsmen of mine	231	” “
3193	3194	3183	3187	These ... kinsmen of mine	231	” “
3202	3203	3204	3204	They	230	” “
3590	3596	3597	3597	she	61	“ Are you my kinsman ? ”
3603	3606	3607	3607	he	60	" No , ”
3610	3626	3607	3607	he	60	“ But your kinsmen had given me their loyalty . That is no small thing . "
3627	3643	3644	3644	He	60	" Is that why you came when . . . when my difference attracted you ? ”
3649	3658	3646	3646	his	60	" I came to see what you were . ”
3665	3674	3659	3659	She	61	“ I am myself . You see me . "
3675	3688	3689	3689	She	61	“ As you see me . Do you imagine you see everything ? "
3694	3719	3689	3689	She	61	“ A lie offends me , Anyanwu , and what I see of you is a lie . Show me what you really are . "
3720	3728	3659	3659	She	61	“ You see what you will see ! ”
3729	3737	3689	3689	She	61	“ Are you afraid to show me ? ”
3738	3742	3689	3689	She	61	“ ... No . ”
3833	3845	3846	3846	she	61	“ Can my concealment be a lie if yours is not ? ”
3849	3853	3854	3854	he	272	“ Mine is , ”
3857	3876	3854	3854	he	272	“ Then show me what you are . Give me the trust you ask me to give you . "
3877	3895	3922	3922	He	272	" You have my trust , Anyanwu , but knowing what I am would only frighten you . "
3896	3903	3904	3904	she	61	" Am I a child then ? ”
3908	3921	3904	3904	she	61	“ Are you my mother who must shield me from adult truths ? ”
3928	3945	3946	3946	he	272	" Most of my people are grateful to me for shielding them from my particular truth , ”
3949	3959	3946	3946	he	272	“ So you say . I have seen nothing . "
4077	4090	4091	4091	he	60	“ Sometimes only a burn will teach a child to respect fire , ”
4094	4125	4091	4091	he	60	“ Come with me to one of the villages Wild Seed 11 of your town , Anyanwu . There I will show you what you think you want to see . ”
4126	4132	4133	4133	she	61	“ What will you do ? "
4137	4166	4133	4133	she	61	“ I will let you choose someone - an enemy or only some useless person that your people would be better without . Then I will kill him . ”
4167	4170	4091	4091	he	60	“ Kill ! ”
4171	4215	4216	4216	He	278	“ I kill , Anyanwu . That is how I keep my youth , my strength . I can do only one thing to show you what I am , and that is kill a man and wear his body like a cloth . ”
4220	4261	4216	4216	He	278	“ This is not the body I was born into . It 's not the tenth I 've worn , nor the hundredth , nor the thousandth . Your gift seems to be a gentle one . Mine is not . ”
4262	4268	4269	4269	she	279	“ You are a spirit , ”
4274	4283	4284	4284	he	278	“ I told you you were a child , ”
4287	4294	4284	4284	he	278	“ See how you frighten yourself ? ”
4377	4383	4384	4384	she	2682	“ You are a spirit ! ”
4486	4511	4479	4479	He	2683	" Woman , if you bring your people here with your noise , I will have no choice but to kill some of them . ”
4520	4530	4531	4531	she	2682	“ Did you kill anyone as you came here ? ”
4534	4557	4531	4531	she	2682	“ No . I went to great trouble to avoid killing for your sake . I thought you might have kinsmen here . "
4558	4572	4479	4479	He	2683	“ Generations of kinsmen . Sons and their sons and even their sons . ”
4573	4585	4531	4531	she	2682	“ I would not want to kill one of your sons . "
4589	4592	4593	4593	She	2682	“ Why ? ”
4599	4606	4593	4593	She	2682	" What are they to you ? ”
4607	4628	4629	4629	She	2682	" How would you receive me if I came to you clothed in the flesh of one of your sons ? ”
4642	4659	4660	4660	He	294	“ You see ? Your children should not be wasted anyway . They may be good — ”
4685	4690	4691	4691	she	2682	“ What is seed ? ”
4694	4703	4704	4704	he	294	“ People too valuable to be casually killed , ”
4711	4720	4704	4704	he	294	“ You must show me what you are . "
4721	4732	4733	4733	He	294	“ How can my sons be of value to you ? "
4748	4768	4733	4733	He	294	" I may have to go to them , Anyanwu . They may be more tractable than their mother . ”
4789	4792	4793	4793	she	2682	“ Come , ”
4796	4808	4793	4793	she	2682	“ It is too open for me to show you here . "
4847	4856	4857	4857	she	2682	“ My sons would do you no good , ”
4864	4876	4857	4857	she	2682	“ They are good men , but they know very little . ”
4877	4888	4857	4857	she	2682	“ They are not like you — any of them ? ”
4889	4892	4957	4957	She	299	“ None . ”
4893	4898	4857	4857	she	2682	“ And your daughters ? ”
4899	4948	4857	4857	she	2682	" Nor them . I watched them carefully until they went away to their husbands ' towns . They are like my mother . They exert great influence on their husbands and on other women , but nothing beyond that . They live their lives and they die . "
4949	4956	4957	4957	She	299	“ They die . . . ? "
4976	4980	4981	4981	she	299	“ They die , ”
4985	4990	4981	4981	she	299	“ Like their fathers . ”
4991	5002	4957	4957	She	299	" Perhaps if your sons and daughters married each other ... "
5003	5006	5007	5007	she	299	“ Abomination ! ”
5012	5021	5007	5007	she	299	“ We are not animals here , Doro ! ”
5249	5256	5257	5257	she	305	“ Will you watch , Doro ? ”
5260	5269	5270	5270	He	60	“ This is what you demanded to see . ”
5417	5422	5402	5402	her	305	“ Is this enough ? ”
5433	5441	5402	5402	her	305	“ Is this truly you , Anyanwu ? ”
5442	5478	5402	5402	her	305	" As I am . As I would always be if I did not age or change myself for others . This shape flows back to me very easily . Others are harder to take . ”
5479	5482	5412	5413	young woman	321	“ Others ! ”
5483	5493	5494	5494	She	305	“ Did you think I could take only one ? ”
5504	5520	5521	5521	she	305	“ I took animal shapes to frighten my people when they wanted to kill me , "
5524	5618	5521	5521	she	305	“ I became a leopard and spat at them . They believe in such things , but they do not like to see them proved . Then I became a sacred python , 14 Wild Seed and no one dared to harm me . The python shape brought me luck . We were needing rain then to save the yam crop , and while I was a python , the rains came . The people decided my magic was good and it took them a long time to want to kill me again . ”
5730	5737	5738	5738	he	60	“ Could you father a child ? ”
5741	5748	5738	5738	he	60	“ In time . Not now . "
5749	5753	5770	5771	The woman	2616	“ Have you ? ”
5754	5762	5763	5763	He	60	“ Yes . But only girl children . ”
5780	5791	5792	5792	he	60	“ I 'm surprised your people have let you live , ”
5795	5806	5807	5807	she	2616	" Do you think I would let them kill me ? "
5814	5846	5810	5810	He	60	“ What will you do then , Anyanwu ? Stay here with them , convincing each new generation that you are best let alone — or will you come with me ? ”
5876	5883	5884	5884	she	2616	“ Is that what you want ? ”
5887	5895	5884	5884	she	2616	“ For me to go with you ? ”
5896	5899	5918	5918	her	2616	“ Yes . ”
5900	5911	5918	5918	her	2616	“ That is your true reason for coming here then . ”
5952	5974	5975	5975	he	60	" I let myself be drawn here because people who had pledged loyalty to me had been taken away in slavery , ”
5978	6041	5975	5975	he	60	“ I went to their village to get them , take them to a safer home , and I found ... only what the slavers had left . I went away , not caring where my feet took me . When they brought me here , I was surprised , and for the first time in many days , I was pleased . ”
6042	6053	5935	5935	She	2616	“ It seems your people are often taken from you . ”
6054	6095	5940	5940	She	2616	“ It does not seem so , it is so . That is why I am gathering them all Wild Seed 15 15 closer together in a new place . It will be easier for me to protect them there . "
6096	6103	5975	5975	he	60	" I have always protected myself . ”
6104	6129	5935	5935	She	2616	" I can see that . You will be very valuable to me . I think you could protect others as well as yourself . ”
6130	6142	5940	5940	She	2616	“ Shall I leave my people to help you protect yours ? "
6143	6158	5975	5975	he	60	“ You should leave so that finally you can be with your own kind . ”
6159	6179	5935	5935	She	2616	“ With one who kills men and shrouds himself in their skins ? We are not alike , Doro . ”
6284	6291	6292	6292	he	60	“ Give me food , Anyanwu , ”
6295	6310	6292	6292	he	60	“ Then I will have the strength to entice you away from this place . ”
6427	6438	6439	6439	he	60	" A bit of yam , at least , Anyanwu , ”
6443	6450	6439	6439	he	60	" I have eaten nothing today . ”
6628	6634	6635	6635	she	2616	“ What do you do ? "
6642	6650	6635	6635	she	2616	“ Steal food when you are hungry ? ”
6652	6655	6656	6656	he	60	“ Yes , ”
6723	6727	6729	6729	Anyanwu	61	“ A thief , ”
6741	6754	6729	6729	Anyanwu	61	“ You steal , you kill . What else do you do ? ”
6755	6759	6760	6760	he	60	" I build , ”
6764	6804	6760	6760	he	60	“ I search the land for people who are a little different — or very different . I search them out , I bring them together in groups , I begin to build them into a strong new people . ”
6812	6829	6805	6805	She	347	“ They let you do this let you take them from their people , their families ? ”
6830	6858	6729	6729	Anyanwu	61	" Some bring their families with them . Many do not have families . Their differences have made them outcasts . They are glad to follow me . ”
6859	6862	6729	6729	Anyanwu	61	“ Always ? ”
6863	6867	6868	6868	he	60	“ Often enough , ”
6871	6909	6868	6868	he	60	“ What happens when people will not follow you ? What happens if they say , ' It seems too many of your people are dying , Doro . We will stay where we are and live . "
6910	7038	7039	7039	Anyanwu	61	" He got up and went to the doorway of the next room where two hard but inviting clay couches had been built out from the walls . He had to sleep . In spite of the youth and strength of the body he was wearing , it was only an ordinary body . If he were careful with itgave it proper rest and food , did not allow it to be injured — it would last him a few more weeks . If he drove it , though , as he had been driving it to reach Anyanwu , he would use it up much sooner . He held his hands before him , palms down and was not surprised to see that they were shaking . “
7053	7054	6868	6868	he	60	" “
7057	7072	6868	6868	he	60	” . The sharpness of her voice stopped him , made him look back . “
7075	7079	6868	6868	he	60	” she said . “
7089	7345	7083	7083	people	2648	” Was that all ? He ignored her , climbed onto one of the couches , Wild Seed 17 lay down on the mat that covered it , and closed his eyes . He thought he heard her come into the room and go out again before he drifted off to sleep , but he paid no attention . He had long ago discovered that people were much more cooperative if he made them answer questions like hers for themselves . Only the stupid actually needed to hear his answer , and this woman was not stupid . When she woke him , the house was full of the odor of food and he got up alert and ravenous . He sat with her , washed his hands absently in the bowl of water she gave him , then used his fingers to scoop up a bit of pounded yam from his platter and dip it into the common pot of peppery soup . The food was good and filling , and for some time he concentrated on it , ignoring Anyanwu except to notice that she was also eating and did not seem inclined to talk . He recalled distantly that there had been some small religious ceremony between the washing of hands and the eating when he had last been with her people . An offering of food and palm wine to the gods . He asked about it once he had taken the edge off his hunger . She glanced at him . “
7352	7353	7349	7349	you	349	” “
7356	7357	7349	7349	you	349	" “
7362	7363	7364	7364	I	0	” “
7368	7375	7364	7364	I	0	” he said . She nodded . “
7390	7474	7387	7387	myself	0	" He smiled a little , but could not help wondering how hard it might be to tame even partially a wild seed woman who had been helping herself for three hundred years . It would not be hard to make her follow him . She had sons and she cared for them , thus she was vulnerable . But she might very well make him regret taking her -especially since she was too valuable to kill if he could possibly spare her . “
7479	7483	7387	7387	myself	0	” she said , “
7533	7534	7535	7535	You	355	” “
7544	7548	7535	7535	You	355	" She sighed . “
7621	7819	7616	7616	we	362	” 18 Wild Seed He ignored her outburst , noticed instead that she had automatically assumed that he wanted her as his wife . That was a natural assumption for her to make , perhaps a correct assumption . He had been asking himself which of his people she should be mated with first , but now he knew he would take her himself — for a while , at least . He often kept the most powerful of his people with him for a few months , perhaps a year . If they were children , they learned to accept him as father . If they were men , they learned to obey him as master . If they were women , they accepted him best as lover or husband . Anyanwu was one of the handsomest women he had ever seen . He had intended to take her to bed this night , and many more nights until he got her to the seed village he was assembling in the British - ruled Colony of New York . But why should that be enough ? The woman was a rare find . He spoke softly . "
7840	7841	7833	7833	you	363	” "
7846	7847	7833	7833	you	363	” "
7852	7922	7833	7833	you	363	” He looked at her with eyes that ignored the male form she still wore . Eyes that spoke to the woman inside — or he hoped they did . It would be much more pleasant to have her come to him because she wanted to rather than because she was afraid . She said nothing — as though his mildness confused her . He had intended it to . “
7943	7944	7932	7932	you	61	” “
7952	7953	7950	7950	yourself	61	” "

8028	8034	8035	8036	This man	2683	” He touched his chest . “
8050	8061	8043	8043	He	2683	” That stopped her for a moment . She shuddered . “
8074	8075	8078	8078	you	0	” “
8081	8082	8083	8083	I	0	” “

8156	8160	8152	8152	I	0	” she whispered . “
8174	8231	8170	8170	I	0	" Doro sat watching her , seeing remembered pain in her eyes . He could not recall the last time he had felt pain at killing a man . Anger , perhaps , when a man of power and potential became arrogant and had to be destroyed — anger at the waste . But not pain . “
8235	8240	8170	8170	I	0	” he said softly . "
8247	8248	8243	8243	you	0	” "
8253	8279	8243	8243	you	0	” She spread them before her , ordinary hands now , not even remarkably ugly as they had been when she was an old woman . “

8360	8365	8340	8340	I	0	” She said nothing . “
8378	8387	8388	8388	I	0	” She sighed , stared into the fire . "
8434	8435	8415	8415	I	0	" “
8444	8502	8415	8415	I	0	” She got up and went outside . It was dark out now - deep , moonless darkness , but Doro did not doubt that Anyanwu could see with those eyes of hers . Where had she gone , though , and why ? She came back , sat down again , and handed him a rock . “
8506	8591	8415	8415	I	0	” she said tonelessly . It was a rock , not hardened mud , and though he might have broken it with another rock or a metal tool , he could make no impression on it with his hands . He returned it to her whole . And she crushed it in one hand . He had to have the woman . She was wild seed of the best kind . She would strengthen any line he bred her into , strengthen it immeasurably . “
8634	8635	8636	8636	I	0	” "
8643	8647	8636	8636	I	0	” she said . “
8653	8658	8651	8651	them	384	” And she insisted , “
8666	8667	8659	8659	You	61	” “
8687	8698	8704	8704	Anyanwu	61	” He looked at her muscular young man 's body . “
8717	8724	8707	8707	I	0	” She managed a wan smile . “
8736	8740	8707	8707	I	0	” she said . “
8750	8751	8743	8743	you	61	” “
8774	8787	8788	8789	A mother	391	” He paused , saw that he now had her full attention . “
8802	8806	8795	8795	her	391	” he continued . "
8835	8865	8827	8827	me	0	” She put her hands to her face , and for a moment he thought she was crying . But her eyes were dry when she looked at him . “
8872	8876	8827	8827	me	0	” she whispered . “
8881	8888	8827	8827	me	0	” He gestured toward his body . “
8917	9112	8907	8907	I	0	” . There was a long silence . She sat staring into the fire again , perhaps making up her mind . Finally , she looked at him , studied him with such intensity he began to feel uncomfortable . His discomfort amazed him . He was more accustomed to making other people uncomfortable . And he did not like her appraising stare — as though she were deciding whether or not to buy him . If he could win her alive , he would teach her manners someday ! It was not until she began to grow breasts that he knew for certain he had won . He got up then , and when the change was complete , he took her to the couch . CHAPTER 2 They arose before dawn the next day . Anyanwu gave Doro a machete and took one for herself . She seemed content as she put a few of her belongings into a long basket to be carried with her . Now that she had made her decision , she expressed no more doubts about leaving with him , though she was concerned for her people . “
9123	9156	9113	9113	You	398	” she told him . She again wore the guise of a young man , and had twisted her cloth around her and between her legs in the way of a man . “
9200	9258	9191	9191	I	0	" He nodded . As long as she kept him going in the right direction , she could lead as long as she wanted to . She had given him pounded yam from the night before to break his fast , and during the night , she had managed to exhaust his strong young body with lovemaking . "
9265	9271	9259	9259	You	398	” she had observed contentedly . “
9283	9354	9355	9355	My	0	” He was surprised to realize how much her small compliment pleased him — how much the woman herself pleased him . She was a worthwhile find in many ways . He watched her take a last look at her house , left swept and neat ; at her compound , airy and pleasant in spite of its smallness . He wondered how many years this had been her home . “
9363	9369	9370	9370	I	0	” she told him softly . "
9479	9480	9474	9474	It	411	” “
9484	9488	9474	9474	It	411	” laughed Doro . "
9567	9601	9564	9564	their	417	” She got two yams and put them into her basket , then got several more and threw them to her goats who scrambled first to escape them , then to get them . “
9609	9630	9564	9564	their	417	” she said laughing . Then she sobered , went to a small shelter where clay figurines representing gods sat . “
9639	9644	9634	9635	my people	184	" she told Doro . “
9651	9658	9634	9635	my people	184	” She gestured toward her house . "
9666	9677	9634	9635	my people	184	” Her eyes seemed to smile through her somber expression . “
9684	9730	9634	9635	my people	184	” Startled , he thought back . He usually tried not to outrage people 's religious beliefs too quickly , though Anyanwu did not seem to have many religious beliefs . But to think he had come near sitting on religious objects without recognizing them ... “
9741	9742	9732	9732	you	0	” “
9745	9750	9751	9752	My mothers	421	” she said simply . “
9754	9769	9751	9752	My mothers	421	” Symbols of ancestral spirits . He remembered now . He shook his head . “
9775	9781	9784	9784	you	0	” he said in English . “
9787	9788	9784	9784	you	0	” “
9804	9805	9794	9794	I	0	" “
9832	9833	9823	9823	I	0	" “
9837	9841	9823	9823	I	0	” he said . “
9851	9859	9846	9846	I	0	” she said staring at the figurines . “
9902	9903	9882	9882	they	192	” “
9920	10311	9917	9917	I	0	” Doro said . Not quite smiling , Anyanwu led him through the compound door , Wild Seed 23 and they began the long trek over a maze of footpaths so narrow that they could walk only in single file between the tall trees . Anyanwu carried her basket on her head and her machete sheathed at her side . Her bare feet and Doro 's made almost no sound on the path - nothing to confuse Anyanwu 's sensitive ears . Several times as they moved along at the pace she set — a swift walk - she turned aside and slipped silently into the bush . Doro followed with equal skill and always shortly afterward people passed by . There were women and children bearing water pots or firewood on their heads . There were men carrying hoes and machetes . It was as Anyanwu had said . They were in the middle of her town , surrounded by villages . No European would have recognized a town , however , since most of the time there were no dwellings in sight . But on his way to her , Doro had stumbled across the villages , across one large compound after another and either slipped past them or walked past boldly as though he had legitimate business . Fortunately , no one had challenged him . People often hesitated to challenge a man who seemed important and purposeful . They would not , however , have hesitated to challenge strangers who hid themselves , who appeared to be spying . As Doro followed Anyanwu now , he worried that he still might wind up wearing the body of one of her kinsmen — and having great trouble with her . He was relieved when she told him they had left her people 's territory behind . At first , Anyanwu was able to lead Doro along already cleared paths through territory she knew either because she had once lived in it or because her daughters lived in it now . Once , as they walked , she was telling him about a daughter who had married a handsome , strong , lazy young man , then run away to a much less imposing man who had some ambition . He listened for a while , then asked : "
10323	10324	10325	10326	Every one	431	” “
10328	10333	10325	10326	Every one	431	” she said proudly . “
10349	10352	10334	10334	They	2760	” Children with “
10354	10413	10414	10414	You	429	" things wrong with them — twins , for instance , and children born feet first , children with almost any deformity , children born with teeth — these children were thrown away . Doro had gotten some of his best stock from earlier cultures who , for one reason or another , put infants out to die . “
10421	10427	10416	10419	forty - seven children	389	” he said in disbelief , "
10437	10441	10431	10431	them	389	” 24 Wild Seed "
10454	10455	10450	10450	They	389	" “
10477	10489	10490	10490	You	0	" Anyanwu stopped so suddenly that he almost ran into her . "
10497	10552	10490	10490	You	0	” she said quietly . He stared down at her — she had still not bothered to make herself taller though she told him she could — and tried to swallow sudden anger . She spoke to him as though he were one of her children . She did not yet understand his power ! “
10557	10566	10567	10567	You	437	” she said in the same quiet voice . “
10571	10572	10574	10574	I	0	” “
10576	10577	10574	10574	I	0	” “
10585	10701	10574	10574	I	0	” That stopped him . There was no challenge in her voice , but he realized at once she was not telling him she was all his — his property . She was saying only that he had whatever small part of herself she reserved for her men . She was not used to men who could demand more . Though she came from a culture in which wives literally belonged to their husbands , she had power and her power had made her independent , accustomed to being her own person . She did not yet realize that she had walked away from that independence when she walked away from her people with him . “
10707	10717	10574	10574	I	0	” he said . But she did not move . "
10725	10732	10718	10718	You	439	” she said . He sighed . “
10740	11338	10738	10738	Anyanwu	61	” For the moment . She turned and led on . Doro followed , thinking that he had better get her with a new child as quickly as he could . Her independence would vanish without a struggle . She would do whatever he asked then to keep her child safe . She was too valuable to kill , and if he abducted any of her descendants , she would no doubt goad him into killing her . But once she was isolated in America with an infant to care for , she would learn submissiveness . Paths became occasional luxuries as they moved into country Anyanwu did not know . More and more , they had to use their machetes to clear the way . Streams became a problem . They flowed swiftly through deep gorges that had to be crossed somehow . Where the streams interrupted footpaths , local people had placed log bridges . But where Doro and Anyanwu found neither paths nor bridges , they had to cut their own logs . Travel became slower and more dangerous . A fall would not have killed either of them to same time in einen eigeneration Wild Seed 25 directly , but Doro knew that if he fell , he would not be able to stop himself from taking over Anyanwu 's body . She was too close to him . On his way north , he had crossed several rivers by simply abandoning his body and taking over the body nearest to him on the far side . And since he was leading now , allowing his tracking sense to draw him to the crew aboard his ship , he could not send her ahead or leave her behind . He would not have wanted to anyway . They were in the country of people who waged war to get slaves to sell to the Europeans . These were people who would cut her to pieces if she began reshaping herself before them . Some of them even had European guns and powder . Their slow progress was not a complete waste of time , though . It gave him a chance to learn more about Anyanwu — and there was more to learn . He discovered that he would not have to steal food while she was with him . Once the two yams were roasted and eaten , she found food everywhere . Each day as they traveled , she filled her basket with fruit , nuts , roots , whatever she could find that was edible . She threw stones with the speed and force of a sling and brought down birds and small animals . At day 's end , there was always a hearty meal . If a plant was unfamiliar to her , she tasted it and sensed within herself whether or not it was poison . She ate several things she said were poison , though none of them seemed to harm her . But she never gave him anything other than good food . He ate whatever she gave him , trusting her abilities . And when a small cut on his hand became infected , she gave him even more reason to trust her . The infected hand had begun to swell by the time she noticed it , and it was beginning to make him sick . He was already deciding how he would get a new body without endangering her . Then , to his surprise , she offered to help him heal . “
11345	11349	11350	11350	You	441	” she said . “
11356	11363	11350	11350	You	441	” He looked at her doubtfully . “
11374	11380	11365	11365	you	441	” She met his eyes . “
11408	11409	11401	11401	I	0	” “
11413	11423	11401	11401	I	0	” He gave her his swollen , inflamed hand . “
11429	11433	11401	11401	I	0	” she warned . “
11437	11608	11401	11401	I	0	” he repeated . 26 Wild Seed She bit his hand . He bore it , holding himself rigid against his own deadly reaction to sudden pain . She had done well to warn him . This was the second time she had been nearer to death than she could imagine . For a time after biting him , she did nothing . Her attention seemed to turn inward , and she did not answer when he spoke to her . Finally , she brought his hand to her mouth again and there was more pain and pressure , but no more biting . She spat three times , each time returning to his hand , then she seemed to caress the wound with her tongue . Her saliva burned like fire . After that she kept a watch on the hand , attending it twice more with that startling , burning pain . Almost at once , the swelling and sickness went away and the wound began to heal . “
11622	11627	11401	11401	I	0	” she told him . “
11685	12440	11672	11672	I	0	” Tiny living things too small to see , but large enough to make him sick . If his wound had not begun to heal so quickly and cleanly , he would not have believed a word she said . As it was , though , his trust in her grew . She was a witch , surely . In any culture she would be feared . She would have to fight to keep her life . Even sensible people who did not believe in witches would turn against her . And Doro , breeder of witches that he was , realized all over again what a treasure she was . Nothing , no one , must prevent his keeping her . It was not until he reached one of his contacts near the coast that someone decided to try . Anyanwu never told Doro that she could jump all but the widest of the rivers they had to cross . She thought at first that he might guess because he had seen the strength of her hands . Her legs and thighs were just as powerful . But Doro was not used to thinking as she did about her abilities , not used to taking her strength or metamorphosing ability for granted . He never guessed , never asked what she could do . She kept silent because she feared that he too could leap the gorges — though in doing so , he might leave his body behind . She did not want to see him kill for so small a reason . She had listened to Wild Seed 27 the stories he told as they traveled , and it seemed to her that he killed too easily . Far too easily — unless the stories were lies . She did not think they were . She did not know whether he would take a life just to get across a river quickly , but she feared he might . This made her begin to think of escaping from him . It made her think longingly of her people , her compound , her home . ... Yet she made herself womanly for him at night . He never had to ask her to do this . She did it because she wanted to , because in spite of her doubts and fears , he pleased her very much . She went to him as she had gone to her first husband , a man for whom she had cared deeply , and to her surprise , Doro treated her much as her first husband had . He listened with respect to her opinions and spoke with respect and friendship as though to another man . Her first husband had taken much secret ridicule for treating her this way . Her second husband had been arrogant , contemptuous , and brutal , yet he had been considered a great man . She had run away from him as she now wished to run away from Doro . Doro could not have known what dissimilar men he brought alive in her memory . He had still given her no proof of the power he claimed , no proof that her children would be in danger from other than an ordinary man if she managed to escape . Yet she continued to believe him . She could not bring herself to get up while he slept and vanish into the forest . For her children 's sake she had to stay with him , at least until she had proof one way or the other . She followed him almost grimly , wondering what it would be like finally to be married to a man she could neither escape nor outlive . The prospect made her cautious and gentle . Her earlier husbands would not have known her . She sought to make him value her and care for her . Thus she might have some leverage with him , some control over him later when she needed it . Much married as she was , she knew she would eventually need it . They were in the lowlands now , passing through wetter country . There was more rain , more heat , many more mosquitoes . Doro got some disease and coughed and coughed . Anyanwu got a fever , but drove it out of herself as soon as she sensed it . There was enough misery to be had without sickness . “
12449	12477	11672	11672	I	0	” she asked in disgust . It was raining now . They were on someone 's pathway laboring through sucking ankle - deep mud . 28 Wild Seed “
12488	12501	11672	11672	I	0	” he told her . He stopped for a moment to cough . “
12525	12526	12527	12527	Strangers	2658	” “
12529	12552	12527	12527	Strangers	2658	” she said with alarm . They had managed to avoid contact with most of the people whose lands they had crossed . "
12560	12565	12553	12553	You	455	” Doro told her . “
12602	12603	12594	12594	they	384	” “
12612	12638	12605	12605	they	384	” she asked , using the question as an excuse to touch the hard flat muscle of his shoulder . She liked to touch him . “
12643	12647	12639	12639	They	384	” he said . “
12671	12680	12668	12668	I	0	” He paused for another fit of coughing . “
12696	12697	12693	12693	me	0	” "
12700	12768	12693	12693	me	0	” She did not want to talk about his changing , his killing . She had tried to cure his sickness so that he would not change , but though she had eased his coughing , prevented him from growing sicker , she had not made him well . That meant she might soon be finding out more about his changing whether she wanted to or not . “
12775	12779	12771	12771	I	0	” she asked . “
12812	12813	12803	12803	you	0	” “
12821	12822	12803	12803	you	0	” "
12825	12826	12803	12803	you	0	" “
12833	12836	12837	12837	He	0	“ Anyanwu ... "
12843	12853	12837	12837	He	0	“ I am telling you , you will know ! ”
13160	13170	13171	13171	he	60	“ The man I dealt with before has died , ”
13175	13182	13183	13183	He	60	“ This fool is his son . ”
13188	13222	13183	13183	He	60	“ The son was present when his father and I bargained . He saw the gifts I brought . But now that his father has died , he feels no obligation to me . ”
13223	13230	13231	13231	Anyanwu	61	“ I think he fears you , ”
13283	13293	13294	13294	Doro	60	“ He knows he is doing a dangerous thing , ”
13297	13328	13294	13294	Doro	60	“ But he is young . His father was a king . Now the son thinks he will use me to prove himself . He has chosen a poor target . "
13329	13337	13384	13384	him	479	“ Have you promised him more gifts ? ”
13338	13362	13294	13294	Doro	60	“ Yes . But he sees only my empty hands . Move away from me , Anyanwu , I have no more patience . ”
13612	13618	13619	13619	she	61	“ What have you done ? ”
13625	13635	13619	13619	she	61	“ This man knew what his arrogance could cost , ”
13677	13683	13684	13684	Doro	60	“ Keep away from me , ”
13688	13711	13684	13684	Doro	60	“ Stay there with the body until I know how many others of his household this fool will sacrifice to his arrogance . ”
13817	13822	13823	13823	Doro	60	“ That is enough ! ”
13831	13837	13823	13823	Doro	60	“ Do not kill him ! ”
14227	14233	14234	14234	he	60	“ We will leave now , ”
14237	14247	14234	14234	he	60	“ We will take a canoe and row ourselves . ”
14248	14256	14257	14257	she	61	“ Why did you kill the child ? ”
14260	14267	14268	14268	he	60	“ To warn this young fool , ”
14280	14323	14268	14268	he	60	“ The boy was the son of a slave and no great loss to the household . I wanted to leave a man here who had authority and who knew me , but this man would not learn . Come , Anyanwu . ”
14465	14470	14471	14471	she	61	“ You must row , ”
14483	14499	14471	14471	she	61	“ I will try to help you when we are beyond sight of this place . ”
14503	14511	14501	14502	Wild Seed	60	" Have you never rowed a canoe ? ”
14512	14530	14531	14531	He	60	“ Not for perhaps three times as long as this new body of yours has been alive . ”
14539	14548	14549	14549	she	61	“ You should not have killed the child , ”
14553	14564	14549	14549	she	61	“ It was wrong no matter why you did it . ”
14565	14572	14501	14502	Wild Seed	60	" Your own people kill children . ”
14573	14636	14549	14549	she	61	“ Only the ones who must be killed — the abominations . And even with them . . . sometimes when the thing wrong with the child was small , I was able to stop the killing . I spoke with the voice of the god , and as long as I did not violate tradition too much , the people listened . ”
14637	14643	14644	14644	he	60	“ Killing children is wasteful , ”
14647	14669	14644	14644	he	60	“ Who knows what useful adults they might have grown into ? But still , sometimes a child must be sacrificed . ”
14835	14837	14840	14840	Annoyance	69	“ sacrifice ”
14871	14880	14881	14881	he	60	“ You need not row for a while , ”
14885	14904	14881	14881	he	60	“ Rest . This body is strong and healthy . It is so good not to be coughing . "
15135	15144	15145	15145	Anyanwu	61	“ Doro , this is an evil place , ”
15155	15162	15163	15163	he	60	" No one will harm you , ”
15211	15224	15225	15225	she	61	“ I have not seen you going about in women 's bodies , ”
15228	15258	15225	15225	she	61	“ People will think before they attack a man - even a small man . And they will not become as angry if a man gives them a beating . ”
15325	15332	15333	15333	she	61	“ Why do we stop here ? ”
15336	15365	15333	15333	she	61	" I have a man here who might know what happened to my people -the people I came to get . This is the nearest seaport to them . ”
15366	15369	15370	15370	She	61	“ Seaport ... ”
15509	15517	15518	15518	He	60	" Nothing will harm you , Anyanwu . ”
15524	15556	15518	15518	He	60	“ Not these slavers , not the sea , not anything at all . I have not brought you all this way only to lose you . You know my power . ”
15562	15586	15518	15518	He	60	“ That power will not harm you either . I have accepted you as my wife . You have only to obey me . ”
15696	15705	15706	15706	she	61	“ Is that one of your white men ? ”
15758	15761	15762	15762	he	60	“ Yes , ”
15765	15788	15762	15762	he	60	“ but he is only a man . He can die as easily as a black man . Move away from me . "
15844	15847	15848	15850	the white man	593	“ Welcome , ”
15855	15867	15848	15850	the white man	593	“ Have you more Wild Seed 35 slaves to sell us ? ”
15950	15958	15959	15959	Doro	60	" Are you sure you know me ? ”
15983	15988	15989	15989	he	497	“ Who are you ? ”
15992	16001	15989	15989	he	497	“ Who ... what do you want here ? ”
16035	16044	16045	16045	Doro	60	" I 'm a friend of Bernard Daly , ”
16048	16055	16045	16045	Doro	60	“ I have business with him . ”
16115	16123	16124	16124	he	597	“ You want to see the captain ? ”
16159	16167	16146	16147	The slaver	597	“ You 'll see him soon enough ! ”
16212	16220	16221	16221	Doro	60	“ That could have been your hand , ”
16225	16233	16221	16221	Doro	60	“ It could have been your head . ”
16234	16244	16186	16186	he	60	" My people would kill you where you stand . ”
16245	16256	16294	16294	Doro	60	“ What good would that do you — in hell ? ”
16259	16270	16271	16272	The slaver	597	“ Turn , and we 'll go to see Daly . "
16284	16293	16294	16294	Doro	60	“ Another word will cost you your head , ”
16374	16381	16382	16382	Doro	60	“ I see business is good , ”
16399	16403	16404	16404	he	72	“ Speak again , ”
16407	16412	16404	16404	he	72	“ Who are you ? ”
16470	16475	16476	16476	he	60	“ You know me , ”
16486	16494	16495	16495	Doro	60	“ I 've left your man alive , ”
16498	16503	16495	16495	Doro	60	“ Teach him manners . "
16504	16508	16509	16509	He	60	" I will . ”
16545	16552	16541	16541	Doro	60	“ Has my crew been here ? ”
16553	16558	16559	16560	the slaver	597	" More than once , ”
16563	16589	16559	16560	the slaver	597	“ Just yesterday , your son Lale chose two men and three women . Strong young blacks they were worth much more than I charged . ”
16590	16596	16597	16597	Doro	60	" I 'll soon see , ”
16630	16642	16643	16643	he	60	“ Woman , you will cause me to make a mistake ! ”
16646	16651	16652	16652	she	61	“ It is Okoye , ”
16655	16671	16652	16652	she	61	“ The son of my youngest daughter . These men must have raided her village . ”
16672	16677	16682	16682	She	61	“ Where is he ? "
16678	16681	16682	16682	She	61	“ There ! ”
16714	16721	16722	16722	Anyanwu	61	" I will go to him , ”
16726	16734	16722	16722	Anyanwu	61	“ though he will not know me . ”
16735	16738	16739	16739	Doro	60	“ Go , ”
16750	16764	16744	16744	he	60	" I may have more business for you , Daly . That boy . ”
16765	16776	16722	16722	Anyanwu	61	“ But ... that one is taken . A company ship "
16777	16781	16782	16782	Doro	60	“ A pity , ”
16785	16794	16782	16782	Doro	60	“ The profit will not be yours then . ”
16806	16812	16795	16796	The man	497	“ What are you offering ? ”
16860	16864	16865	16865	Doro	60	" One moment , ”
16873	16890	16865	16865	Doro	60	“ Anyanwu , is the boy alone or are there other members of your family here ? ”
16891	16903	16912	16912	her	632	" He is alone . The others have been taken away . ”
16904	16907	16908	16908	She	632	“ When ? "
16920	16933	16917	16917	Doro	60	“ The last ones were sold to white men many days ago . "
17019	17023	17024	17024	Doro	60	“ Unchain him , ”
17042	17055	17056	17056	Doro	60	“ I 'll send one of my men back with the money , ”
17070	17077	17078	17078	he	72	" I 'll walk with you , "
17081	17109	17078	17078	he	72	“ It is n't far . One of your people might shoot you if they see you looking that way with only two more blacks as companions . ”
17131	17140	17141	17141	he	72	“ Do you think I 'll cheat you ? ”
17144	17150	17141	17141	he	72	“ After all this time ? ”
17164	17170	17171	17171	he	72	“ You could cheat me , ”
17174	17191	17171	17171	he	72	“ You could rob me whenever you chose , and yet you pay well . Why ? ”
17192	17207	17236	17236	Doro	60	" Perhaps because you are wise enough to accept what you can not understand . ”
17208	17211	17236	17236	Doro	60	“ You ? ”
17212	17223	17171	17171	he	72	“ Me . What do you tell yourself I am ? ”
17224	17235	17236	17236	Doro	60	" I used to think you were the devil himself . ”
17281	17288	17289	17289	he	72	“ Who are you , then ? ”
17294	17297	17289	17289	he	72	“ Job ? ”
17298	17301	17302	17302	Daly	72	" No . "
17308	17315	17304	17304	his	72	" Job was a stronger man . ”
17329	17337	17338	17338	he	60	“ You are content with your life , ”
17425	17433	17435	17437	Anyanwu 's grandson	656	“ Why does the white animal follow ? ”
17445	17455	17435	17437	Anyanwu 's grandson	656	“ What has he to do with us now ? ”
17456	17465	17467	17467	Anyanwu	61	“ My master must pay him for you , ”
17484	17488	17489	17489	she	61	“ And also , "
17492	17501	17489	17489	she	61	" I think this man serves him somehow . ”
17502	17517	17521	17521	himself	60	" If the white man is a slave , why should he be paid ? ”
17523	17545	17521	17521	himself	60	“ Because I choose to pay him , Okoye . A man may choose what he will do with his slaves . ”
17546	17561	17521	17521	himself	60	" Do you send your slaves to kill our kinsmen and steal us away ? "
17562	17565	17566	17566	Doro	60	" No , "
17569	17578	17566	17566	Doro	60	“ My people only buy and sell slaves . ”
17596	17612	17591	17591	He	72	“ Then they send others to prey on us . It is the same thing ! ”
17613	17625	17626	17626	Doro	60	“ What I permit my people to do is my affair , ”
17629	17634	17626	17626	Doro	60	“ But they — ! ”
17656	17673	17635	17635	Doro	60	“ What I permit them to do is my affair , Okoye . That is all . ”
17699	17705	17706	17706	Daly	72	“ What were they saying ? ”
17709	17716	17717	17717	Doro	60	“ They disapprove of your profession , ”
17721	17725	17726	17726	Daly	72	" Heathen savages , ”
17729	17740	17726	17726	Daly	72	“ They 're like animals . They 're all cannibals . ”
17741	17746	17747	17747	Doro	60	“ These are n't , ”
17750	17758	17747	17747	Doro	60	“ though some of their neighbors are . ”
17759	17764	17765	17765	Daly	72	“ All of them , ”
17768	17775	17776	17776	Doro	60	“ Just give them the chance . ”
17779	17799	17776	17776	Doro	60	“ Well , no doubt the missionaries will reach them eventually and teach them to practice only symbolic cannibalism . ”
17815	17823	17824	17824	he	72	“ You should n't say such things , ”
17827	17838	17824	17824	he	72	“ Not even you are beyond the reach of God . ”
17839	17845	17846	17846	Doro	60	“ Spare me your mythology , ”
17849	17858	17846	17846	Doro	60	“ and your righteous inWild Seed 39 dignation . ”
17874	17886	17887	17887	Doro	60	“ At least we cannibals are honest about what we do , "
17890	17926	17887	17887	Doro	60	“ We do n't pretend as you slavers do to be acting for the benefit of our victims ' souls . We do n't tell ourselves we 've caught them to teach them civilized religion . ”
17933	17951	17927	17927	Daly	72	“ But ... I did not mean you were a ... a ... I did not mean ... "
17952	17956	17957	17957	Doro	60	“ Why not ? ”
17966	17982	17957	17957	Doro	60	" I assure you , I 'm the most efficient cannibal you will ever meet . "
18125	18131	18132	18132	Doro	60	“ Not a coastal people , ”
18135	18159	18132	18132	Doro	60	“ An inland tribe from the grasslands beyond the forests . I showed you a few of them years ago when we met . "
18160	18167	18168	18168	Daly	72	“ These blacks are all alike , ”
18171	18178	18179	18179	He	72	“ It 's hard to tell . ”
18206	18216	18217	18217	he	60	" If you ca n't do better than that , ”
18220	18228	18217	18217	he	60	" you 're no good to me . ”
18264	18270	18271	18271	he	72	" It was a joke , ”

18296	18338	18292	18292	Daly	72	“ I remember their looks and the words of their language that you taught me and their vile tempers . Not an easy people to enslave and keep alive . None like them have gone through my hands without being tested . ”
18339	18347	18348	18348	Daly	72	" Speak the words I taught you . ”

18817	18826	18812	18812	Doro	60	“ Yes , I know you would have . ”
18859	18870	18871	18871	he	72	“ What is the little Igbo you have brought aboard ? ”
18885	18889	18890	18890	Doro	60	“ Wild seed , ”
18893	18932	18890	18890	Doro	60	“ Carrier of a bloodline I believed was lost — and , I think , of another that I did not know existed . I have some exploring to do in her homeland once she is safely away . ”
18933	18944	18871	18871	he	72	“ She ! But ... that black is a man . ”
18945	18964	18965	18965	Daly	72	“ Sometimes . But she was born a woman . She is a woman most of the time . ”
18972	18996	18967	18967	his	72	“ The monstrosities you collect ! I suppose now you will breed creatures who do n't know whether to piss standing or squatting . ”
18997	19018	18965	18965	Daly	72	" They will know — if I can breed them . They will know , but it wo n't matter . "
19019	19031	19032	19032	Doro	60	“ Such things should be burned . They are against God ! ”
19280	19287	19288	19288	he	72	“ Let me work for you , "
19292	19326	19288	19288	he	72	“ Take me aboard one of your ships or even back to your homeland . I 'm still strong . Even with one hand , I can work . I can handle blacks . ”
19327	19333	19334	19334	Doro	60	" I want you here , ”
19339	19373	19334	19334	Doro	60	“ I 've made arrangements with some of the local kings while you were recovering . They 'll trade with you exclusively from now on . Daly had stared at him in amazement . “
19384	19385	19376	19376	you	60	” "
19397	19433	19388	19388	you	72	” Doro had answered . And Daly had been back in business . Doro sent him black traders who sold him slaves and his company sent him white traders who 42 Wild Seed bought them . “
19446	19451	19434	19435	Someone else	609	" Doro told him . "
19472	19673	19467	19467	I	0	” So much for his control . Neither his support of Daly nor his spies left along the coast - people who should have reported to Daly — had been enough . Now they were useless . If they had been special stock , people with unusual abilities , Doro would have resettled them in America , where they could be useful . But they were only ordinary people bought by wealth or fear or belief that Doro was a god . He would forget them . He might forget Daly also once he had returned to Anyanwu 's homeland and sought out as many of her descendants as he could find . At the moment , though , Daly could still be useful — and he could still be trusted ; Doro knew that now . Perhaps the seed people had been taken to Bonny or New Calabar or some other slave port , but they had not passed near Daly . The most talented and deceptive of Doro 's own children could not have lied to him successfully while he was on guard . Also , Daly had discovered he enjoyed being an arm of Doro 's power . “
19681	19685	19467	19467	I	0	” Daly said , “
19710	19711	19701	19701	I	0	” “
19715	19719	19720	19720	You	0	” Doro ordered . “
19732	19736	19726	19726	I	0	” Daly sighed . “
19752	19780	19781	19783	Slimy little bastard	733	” he admitted . Doro smiled and had the ship 's captain , John Woodley , pay for the boy , Okoye , and send Daly ashore . “
19785	19997	19781	19783	Slimy little bastard	733	” Woodley muttered when Daly was gone . Doro said nothing . Woodley , one of Doro 's ordinary , ungifted sons , had always disliked Daly . This amused Doro since he considered the two men much alike . Woodley was the child of a casual liaison Doro had had forty - five years before with a London merchant 's daughter . Doro had married the woman and provided for her when he learned she would bear his child , but he quickly left her a widow , well off , but alone except for her infant son . Doro had seen John Woodley twice as the boy grew toward adulthood . When , on the second visit , Woodley expressed a desire to go to sea , Doro had him apprenticed to one of Doro 's shipmasters . Woodley had worked his own way up . He could have become wealthy , could now be commanding a great ship instead of one of Doro 's smallest . But he had Wild Seed 43 chosen to stay near Doro . Like Daly , he enjoyed being an arm of Doro 's power . And like Daly , he was envious of others who might outrank him in Doro 's esteem . “
20012	20017	20007	20007	you	735	" Woodley told Doro . “
20039	20040	20041	20041	He	734	” “
20046	20050	20041	20041	He	734	” Doro said . “
20056	20057	20041	20041	He	734	" “
20064	20144	20145	20145	I	0	" Doro shrugged and let the contradiction stand . Woodley knew better than Daly ever could just how much it was the same . He 'd worked too closely with Doro 's more gifted children to overestimate his own value . And he knew the living generations of Doro 's sons and daughters would populate a city . He knew how easily both he and Daly could be replaced . After a moment he sighed as Daly had sighed . “
20158	20162	20145	20145	I	0	” he said . “
20167	20171	20145	20145	I	0	” Doro answered . “
20175	20176	20145	20145	I	0	” “
20180	20248	20249	20249	We	740	” Woodley muttered bitterly . He turned and walked away . ons of Lily both had CHAPTER 4 The ship frightened Anyanwu , but it frightened Okoye more . He had seen that the men aboard were mostly white men , and in his life , he had had no good experiences with white men . Also , fellow slaves had told him the whites were cannibals . “
20261	20266	20249	20249	We	740	” he told Anyanwu . "
20269	20274	20249	20249	We	740	" Anyanwu assured him . “
20305	20309	20299	20299	He	744	” Okoye shuddered . “
20316	20332	20335	20335	he	744	” Anyanwu stared at him . How had he discovered Doro 's strangeness so quickly ? "
20375	20376	20372	20373	Some spirit	749	” “
20379	20400	20372	20373	Some spirit	749	” Anyanwu spoke very softly and waited until he turned from his terrified gazing into space and looked at her . “
20407	20411	20404	20405	a spirit	2744	” she said , “
20435	20436	20437	20437	You	74	" “
20450	20458	20447	20447	your	74	" Anyanwu gave him a sad smile . "
20468	20469	20447	20447	your	74	" "
20475	20476	20472	20473	a spirit	2744	” “
20488	20503	20486	20486	Okoye	74	” He stared at her for a time without answering . Finally he asked , “
20511	20512	20486	20486	Okoye	74	” “
20520	20521	20515	20515	I	0	” “
20528	20529	20525	20525	you	0	” “
20538	20539	20531	20531	you	0	” “
20551	20552	20545	20546	The god	2996	” “
20562	20566	20567	20567	She	181	” Anyanwu said . “
20655	20656	20649	20649	You	0	" "
20662	20666	20657	20657	I	0	” Okoye said . “
20671	20672	20673	20673	You	0	" “
20677	20678	20673	20673	You	0	” "
20684	20685	20686	20686	I	0	" “
20689	20690	20686	20686	I	0	" "
20696	20697	20701	20701	you	0	” "
20704	20708	20698	20698	I	0	” Anyanwu said . “
20727	20786	20714	20714	you	0	” She smiled , remembering the small , stoic boy who had refused to cry with the pain of his sickness , who had refused to smile when she told him the old fables her mother had told her . Only when she startled him with her changes did he begin to pay attention . She spoke softly . “
20802	20863	20793	20796	your mother 's mother	181	” She drew with her finger the jagged old scar that she had once carried beneath her left eye . As she drew it , she aged and furrowed the flesh so that the scar appeared . Okoye bolted toward the door . Anyanwu caught him , held him easily in spite of his greater size and his desperate strength . “
20873	20886	20887	20887	You	74	" she asked when the violence had gone out of his struggles . “
20892	20896	20889	20890	a man	2743	” he gasped . “
20901	20902	20889	20890	a man	2743	” “
20908	20912	20905	20906	no spirit	768	” she said . “
20935	20985	20905	20906	no spirit	768	" He began to struggle again . He was a young man now , not a child . The easy childhood acceptance of the impossible was gone , and she dared not let him go . In his present state , he might jump into the water and drown . "
21003	21008	20997	21001	the old woman you remember	771	” Still he struggled . “
21049	21061	21038	21038	you	74	” He stopped his struggles , stood gasping in her grip . “
21069	21073	21062	21062	You	74	” she said . “
21080	21127	21074	21074	I	0	” 46 Wild Seed He was still now , so she released him . The bond between a man and his mother 's kin was strong and gentle . But for the boy 's own safety , she kept her body between his and the door . "
21135	21139	21129	21129	I	0	” she asked . “
21142	21175	21129	21129	I	0	” the boy whispered . She became an old woman for him . The shape was familiar and easy to slip into . She had been an old woman for so long . "
21180	21188	21178	21178	you	0	” Okoye said wonderingly . She smiled . “
21200	21208	21196	21198	an old woman	178	” To her surprise , he laughed . “
21235	21236	21225	21225	People	2648	” “
21242	21259	21239	21239	you	0	” He stared at her with great curiosity , walked around her to look at her . “
21281	21282	21283	21283	I	0	” “
21289	21290	21283	21283	I	0	" "
21308	21309	21306	21306	you	0	” “
21313	21323	21306	21306	you	0	” The boy stared speechless at her long breasts . “
21413	21414	21405	21405	He	60	” “
21430	21431	21422	21422	He	60	” "
21441	21442	21438	21439	a woman	2710	” “
21449	21450	21438	21439	a woman	2710	” “
21486	21501	21470	21484	a man who was as different from other men as I am from other women	797	” If this was not entirely true , Okoye did not need to know . "
21505	21519	21470	21484	a man who was as different from other men as I am from other women	797	" Okoye paused as though not certain of what he wanted to say . “
21526	21910	21470	21484	a man who was as different from other men as I am from other women	797	” Obligingly , she let her true shape flow back to her , became the young woman whose body had ceased to age when she was about twenty years old . At twenty , she had a violent , terrible sickness during which she had heard voices , felt pain in one part of her body Wild Seed 47 after another , screamed and babbled in foreign dialects . Her young husband had feared she would die . She was Anasi , his first wife , and though she was in disfavor with his family because after five years of marriage , she had produced no children , he fought hard against losing her . He sought help for her , frantically paying borrowed money to the old man who was then the oracle , making sacrifices of valuable animals . No man ever cared more for her than he did . And it seemed that the medicine worked . Her body ceased its thrashing and struggling , and her senses returned , but she found herself vastly changed . She had a control over her body that was clearly beyond anything other people could manage . She could look inside herself and control or alter what she saw there . She could finally be worthy of her husband and of her own womanhood ; she could become pregnant . She bore her husband ten strong children . In the centuries that followed , she never did more for any man . When she realized the years had ceased to mark her body , she experimented and learned to age herself as her husband aged . She learned quickly that it was not good to be too different . Great differences caused envy , suspicion , fear , charges of witchcraft . But while her first husband lived , she never entirely gave up her beauty . And sometimes when he came to her at night , she allowed her body to return to the youthful shape that came so easily , so naturally — the true shape . In that way , her husband had a young senior wife for as long as he lived . And now Okoye had a mother 's mother who appeared to be younger than he was . "
21913	21919	21470	21484	a man who was as different from other men as I am from other women	797	" the boy said doubtfully . "
21924	21925	21470	21484	a man who was as different from other men as I am from other women	797	” "
21928	21932	21470	21484	a man who was as different from other men as I am from other women	797	” Anyanwu said . “
21958	21959	21949	21949	I	0	” “
21968	21969	21964	21964	you	81	” “
21977	21978	21980	21980	him	802	” “
21987	21988	21990	21990	him	802	” "
21992	21998	21990	21990	him	802	” Okoye shook his head . “
22018	22019	22013	22013	you	81	” “
22053	22937	22047	22047	He	802	” The water harmed him . Soon after Anyanwu had revealed herself , he began to grow ill . Wild Seed He became dizzy . His head hurt him . He said he thought he would vomit if he did not leave the confinement of the small room . Anyanwu took him out on deck where the air was fresh and cooler . But even there , the gentle rocking of the ship seemed to bother him — and began to bother her . She began to feel ill . She seized on the feeling at once , examining it . There was drowsiness , dizziness , and a sudden cold sweat . She closed her eyes , and while Okoye vomited into the water , she went over her body carefully . She discovered that there was a wrongness , a kind of imbalance deep within her ears . It was a tiny disturbance , but she knew her body well enough to notice the smallest change . For a moment , she observed this change with interest . Clearly , if she did nothing to correct it , her sickness would grow worse ; she would join Okoye , vomiting over the rail . But no . She focused on her inner ears and remembered perfection there , remembered organs and fluids and pressures in balance , their wrongness righted . Remembering and correcting were one gesture ; balance was restored . It had taken her much practice and much pain — to learn such ease of control . Every change she made in her body had to be understood and visualized . If she was sick or injured , she could not simply wish to be well . She could be killed as easily as anyone else if her body was damaged in some way she could not understand quickly enough to repair . Thus , she had spent much of her long life learning the diseases , disorders , and injuries that she could suffer - learning them often by inflicting mild versions of them on herself , then slowly , painfully , by trial and error , coming to understand exactly what was wrong and how to impress healing . Thus , when her enemies came to kill her , she knew more about surviving than they did about killing . And now she knew how to set right this new disturbance that could have caused her considerable misery . But her knowledge was of no help to Okoye - yet . She searched through her memory for some substance that would help him . Within her long memory was a catalogue of cures and poisons — often the same substances given in different quantities , with different preparation , or in different combinations . Many of them she could manufacture within her body as she had manufactured a healing balm for Doro 's hand . This time , though , before she thought of anything that might be useful , a white man came to her , bringing a small metal container full of some liquid . The man looked at Okoye , then nodded and put Wild Seed the container into Anyanwu 's hands . He made signs to indicate that she should get Okoye to drink . Anyanwu looked at the container , then sipped from it herself . She would not give anyone medicine she did not understand . The liquid was startlingly strong stuff that first choked her , then slowly , pleasantly warmed her , pleased her . It was like palm wine , but much stronger . A little of it might make Okoye forget his misery . A little more might make him sleep . It was no cure , but it would not hurt him and it might help . Anyanwu thanked the white man in her own language and saw that he was looking at her breasts . He was a beardless , yellow - haired young man — a physical type completely strange to Anyanwu . Another time , her curiosity would have driven her to learn more about him , try to communicate with him . She found herself wondering obscurely whether the hair between his legs was as yellow as that on his head . She laughed aloud at herself , and the young man , unknowing , watched her breasts jiggle . Enough of that ! She took Okoye back into the cabin , and when the yellow - haired man followed , she stepped in front of him and gestured unmistakably for him to leave . He hesitated , and she decided that if he touched her uninvited , she would throw him into the sea . Sea , yes . That was the English word for the water . If she said it , would he understand ? But the man left without coercion . Anyanwu coaxed Okoye to swallow some of the liquid . It made him cough and choke at first , but he got it down . By the time Doro came to the cabin , Okoye was asleep . Doro opened the door without warning and came in . He looked at her with obvious pleasure and said , “
22950	22951	22944	22944	I	0	” "
22957	22961	22944	22944	I	0	” He laughed . “
22985	23092	22975	22976	my men	3044	" She followed him deeper into the vessel through large rooms containing only a few people segregated by sex . The people lounged on mats or gathered in pairs or small groups to talk - those who had found others who spoke their language . No one was chained as the slaves on shore had been . No one 50 Wild Seed Prise . seemed to be hurt or frightened . Two women sat nursing their babies . Anyanwu heard many languages , including , finally , her own . She stopped at the mat of a young woman who had been singing softly to herself . “
23097	23117	23095	23095	you	809	” she asked the woman in surprise . The woman jumped to her feet , took Anyanwu 's hands . “
23122	23127	23118	23118	You	809	” she said joyfully . "
23144	23185	23142	23142	Udenkwo	83	” The woman 's own speech was somewhat strange to Anyanwu . She pronounced some of her words differently or used different words so that Anyanwu had to replay everything in her mind to be certain what had been said . “
23194	23198	23188	23188	you	809	” she asked . “
23208	23235	23200	23201	these whites	810	" From the corner of her eye , she saw Doro turn to look at her indignantly . But he allowed Udenkwo to answer for herself . “
23239	23243	23244	23244	Strangers	2658	” she said . “
23277	23288	23268	23268	She	814	“ No one has beaten me here or tied me . "
23289	23295	23268	23268	She	814	" How were you taken ? ”
23296	23321	23268	23268	She	814	" I went to the river with friends to get water . We were all taken and our children with us . My son ... "
23322	23327	23268	23268	She	814	“ Where is he ? ”
23328	23351	23352	23353	The woman	2616	“ They took him from me . When I was sold for the second time , he was not sold with me . ”
23371	23380	23364	23364	She	2616	“ What will be done with me now ? ”
23386	23400	23383	23383	Doro	60	“ You will go to my country . You belong to me now . ”
23401	23417	23364	23364	She	2616	“ I am a freeborn woman ! My father and my husband are great men ! ”
23418	23423	23383	23383	Doro	60	“ That is past . ”
23424	23433	23383	23383	Doro	60	“ Let me go back to my people ! "
23434	23450	23364	23364	She	2616	" My people will be your people . You will obey me as they obey . "
23463	23475	23451	23451	Udenkwo	83	“ Will I be tied again ? Will I be beaten ? ”
23476	23482	23383	23383	Doro	60	“ Not if you obey . "
23483	23489	23364	23364	She	2616	“ Will I be sold ? ”
23490	23493	23494	23494	She	817	" No . "
23522	23529	23519	23519	she	817	“ Will you buy my son ? ”
23530	23534	23535	23535	Doro	60	“ I would , ”
23538	23557	23535	23535	Doro	60	“ but who knows where he may have been taken — one boy . How old was he ? ”
23558	23564	23565	23565	Doro	60	“ About five years old . ”
23568	23578	23565	23565	Doro	60	“ I would not know how to find him . ”
23612	23623	23609	23609	Anyanwu	61	“ Udenkwo , who is your father and his father ? ”
23630	23634	23635	23635	Anyanwu	61	“ Your father , ”
23638	23642	23635	23635	Anyanwu	61	“ his people . ”
23702	23711	23712	23712	she	61	“ I have known some of your people , ”
23715	23727	23712	23712	she	61	“ You are safe here . You will be well treated . ”
23734	23741	23742	23742	She	61	" I will see you again . ”
23760	23769	23757	23757	she	61	“ Could you not look for her son ? ”
23770	23773	23774	23774	Doro	60	" No , "
23777	23801	23774	23774	Doro	60	“ I told her the truth . I would not know where to begin - or even whether the boy is still alive . ”
23802	23810	23757	23757	she	61	“ She is one of my descendants . ”
23811	23830	23831	23831	Doro	60	" As you said , she will be well treated . I can offer no more than that . ”
23836	23846	23831	23831	Doro	60	“ The land must be full of your descendants . "
23851	23926	23847	23847	Anyanwu	61	" You are right . They are so numerous , so well scattered , and so far from me in their generations that they do not know me or each other . Sometimes they marry one another and I hear of it . It is abomination , but I can not speak of it without focusing the wrong kind of attention on the young ones . They can not defend themselves as I can . "
23927	23935	23936	23936	Doro	60	" You are right to keep silent , ”
23939	23952	23936	23936	Doro	60	“ Sometimes ways must be different for people as different as ourselves . ”
23953	23956	23957	23957	she	828	“ We , ”
23961	23976	23957	23957	she	828	“ Did you have children of ... of a body born to your mother ? ”
23982	23988	23989	23989	he	60	“ I died too young , ”
23992	23999	23989	23989	he	60	“ I was thirteen years old . ”
24000	24011	24013	24014	Wild Seed	60	“ That is a sad thing , even for you . "
24015	24018	24019	24019	They	829	“ Yes . ”
24033	24082	24026	24026	he	60	“ I have lived for more than thirty - seven hundred years and fathered thousands of children . I have become a woman and borne children . And still , I long to know what my body could have produced . Another being like myself ? A companion ? ”
24083	24087	24089	24089	Anyanwu	61	" Perhaps not , ”
24091	24106	24107	24107	Doro	60	“ You might have been like me , having one ordinary child after another . ”
24114	24156	24107	24107	Doro	60	“ You must take your daughter 's son to meet that girl when he is feeling better . The girl 's age is wrong , but she is still a little younger than Okoye . Perhaps they will comfort each other . ”
24157	24162	24026	24026	he	60	“ They are kinsmen ! ”
24163	24205	24026	24026	he	60	“ They will not know that unless you tell them , and you should be silent once more . They have only each other , Anyanwu . If they wish , they can marry after the customs of their new land . ”
24206	24212	24107	24107	Doro	60	“ And how is that ? ”
24213	24226	24026	24026	he	60	“ There is a ceremony . They pledge themselves to each other before a”-he
24233	24236	24026	24026	he	60	translated—“a priest . ”
24237	24253	24107	24107	Doro	60	“ They have no family but me , and the girl does not know me . ”
24254	24260	24107	24107	Doro	60	“ It does not matter . "
24261	24269	24026	24026	he	60	“ It will be a poor marriage . ”
24270	24309	24107	24107	Doro	60	" No . I will give them land and seed . Others will teach them to live in their new country . It is a good place . People need not stay poor there if they will work . ”
24310	24317	24107	24107	Doro	60	“ Children of mine will work . ”
24318	24325	24326	24326	He	832	“ Then all will be well . ”
24483	24486	24487	24487	he	844	“ Isaac , ”
24494	24497	24487	24487	he	844	“ Isaac . ”
24523	24526	24527	24527	she	833	" Isaac ? ”
24534	24537	24538	24538	He	844	“ Isaac . ”
24548	24551	24544	24544	he	844	“ You ? ”
24552	24555	24556	24556	she	833	“ Anyanwu ! ”
24560	24563	24556	24556	she	833	“ Anyanwu . ”
24902	24905	24906	24906	She	833	“ Anyanwu ! ”
24928	24931	24932	24932	She	833	“ Anyanwu ! ”
25014	25017	25007	25007	Hands	85	“ Anyanwu ! ”
25039	25044	25045	25045	he	875	" Stop , Anyanwu ! ”
25053	25056	25045	25045	he	875	" stop , ”
25073	25076	25077	25079	A new voice	876	“ Anyanwu ! ”
25084	25093	25077	25079	A new voice	876	“ Anyanwu , you are not alone here . "
25136	25139	25140	25140	She	833	“ Doro ? ”
25176	25184	25172	25172	she	833	“ Doro , something happened to me . ”
25185	25189	25190	25190	Her	833	" I know . ”
25210	25213	25214	25214	she	833	“ Isaac ? ”
25279	25288	25274	25274	Doro	60	“ He did not hurt you , Anyanwu ? ”
25289	25292	25293	25293	She	833	" No . "
25310	25318	25293	25293	She	833	“ I think I have hurt him . ”
25329	25350	25319	25319	She	833	" He helped me . I would not have hurt him , but . . . some spirit possessed me . ”
25351	25358	25359	25359	Doro	60	“ Shall I apologize for you ? ”
25363	25366	25359	25359	Doro	60	“ Yes . ”
25445	25456	25457	25457	Doro	60	" He says you are as strong as a man , ”
25464	25481	25461	25461	She	833	“ I can be as strong as many men , but he need not know that . ”
25482	25487	25488	25488	Doro	60	" He can know , ”
25491	25505	25488	25488	Doro	60	" He has strengths of his own . He is · my son . ”
25506	25509	25461	25461	She	833	“ Your ... "
25510	25518	25523	25523	he	60	“ The son of an American body . ”
25529	25546	25523	25523	he	60	“ A mixed body , white and black and Indian . Indians are a brown people . ”
25547	25553	25461	25461	She	833	“ But he is white . ”
25554	25580	25523	25523	he	60	“ His mother was white . German and yellow - haired . He is more her son than mine - in appearance , at least . ”
25593	25602	25603	25603	Doro	60	“ There is nothing for you to fear , ”
25607	25624	25603	25603	Doro	60	“ You are not alone . Your children 's children are here . I am here . "
25625	25634	25523	25523	he	60	“ How can you know what I feel ? ”
25635	25650	25523	25523	he	60	“ I would have to be blind not to know , not to see . "
25651	25654	25603	25603	Doro	60	“ But ... "
25655	25710	25523	25523	he	60	“ Do you think you are the first woman I have taken from her people ? I have been watching you since we left your village , knowing that this time would come for you . Our kind have a special need to be with either our kinsmen or others who are like us . "
25711	25718	25719	25719	He	886	“ You are not like me ! ”
25759	25781	25743	25743	She	887	“ Will I see , someday , what you are like when you are not hiding in another man 's skin ? ”
25818	25844	25845	25845	He	886	" Pray to your gods that you never do , Anyanwu . Let me be a man . Be content with me as a man . ”
25950	25962	25963	25963	Doro	60	“ I just told her how easy she was to read , ”
25976	25985	25986	25986	Doro	60	“ You 're fairly easy to read yourself , ”
25989	25996	25997	25997	Isaac	84	" I ca n't help it , ”
26000	26010	25997	25997	Isaac	84	“ You ought to put more clothes on her . ”
26011	26061	25963	25963	Doro	60	" I will , eventually . For now , just restrain yourself . She 's one of the few people aboard who could probably kill you — just as you 're one of the few who could kill her . And I 'd rather not lose either of you . ”
26062	26073	25997	25997	Isaac	84	“ I would n't hurt her . I like her . ”
26074	26077	25997	25997	Isaac	84	“ Obviously . ”
26078	26082	25963	25963	Doro	60	“ I mean ... "
26083	26097	25997	25997	Isaac	84	“ I know , I know . She seems to like you too . "
26118	26128	26114	26114	Doro	60	“ Do you mean to keep her for yourself ? ”
26133	26138	26139	26139	he	60	" For a while , "
26254	26267	26268	26268	Doro	60	" I ca n't imagine how your ability and hers would combine , ”
26281	26313	26274	26274	Isaac	84	" It seems to me the small , complex things she does within her body would require some of the same ability you use to move large objects outside your body . ”
26320	26333	26314	26317	Wild Seed 57 Isaac	84	“ How can she tell what she 's doing down inside herself ? ”
26334	26380	26268	26268	Doro	60	" Apparently , she 's also a little like one of my Virginia families . They can tell what 's going on in closed places or in places miles from them . I 've been planning to get you together with a couple of them . "
26381	26412	26314	26317	Wild Seed 57 Isaac	84	" I can see why . I 'd be better myself if I could see that way . Would n't have run the Mary Magdalene onto those rocks last year . ”
26413	26427	26268	26268	Doro	60	“ You did well enough — kept us afloat until we made port . ”
26428	26456	26457	26457	Doro	60	“ If I got a child by Anyanwu , maybe he 'd have that other kind of sight . I 'd rather have her than your Virginians . ”
26510	26517	26518	26518	he	60	" You 'll have the Virginians , ”
26521	26537	26518	26518	he	60	“ You 'll have Anyanwu too . I 'll share her with you . Later . ”
26538	26541	26542	26542	Isaac	84	“ When ? ”
26550	26610	26542	26542	Isaac	84	“ Later , I said . This is a dangerous time for her . She 's leaving behind everything she 's ever known , and she has no clear idea what she 's exchanging it for . If we force too much on her now , she could kill herself before she 's been of any use to us . ”
26759	26773	26774	26774	Anyanwu	61	“ They may not please each other as much as they seem to , "
26778	26787	26774	26774	Anyanwu	61	“ Who knows what is in their minds ? ”
26910	26917	26918	26918	Okoye	74	“ The white man , Woodley ? ”
26921	26930	26918	26918	Okoye	74	“ What has he to do with us ? ”
26931	26958	26959	26960	The boy	485	" In your new country , if you wish to marry , you must pledge yourselves before a priest or a man of authority like Woodley . "
26966	27002	26962	26962	his	485	“ Everything is different here . I do not know . My father had chosen a wife for me , and I was pleased with her . Overtures had already been made to her family . "
27003	27011	27012	27012	Doro	60	“ You will never see her again . ”
27030	27041	27021	27021	He	60	" The world is not a gentle place , Okoye . ”
27042	27051	27021	27021	He	60	" Shall I marry because you say so ? ”
27077	27097	27074	27074	Doro	60	" When I speak to be obeyed , young one , you will know , and you will obey . ”
27117	27122	27123	27123	he	74	" Must I marry ? ”
27128	27131	27123	27123	he	74	" No . "
27132	27138	27139	27139	Doro	60	“ She had a husband . ”
27142	27155	27139	27139	Doro	60	“ What will you do with us in this homeland of yours ? ”
27156	27221	27123	27123	he	74	" Perhaps nothing . I will give you land and seed and some of my people will help you learn the ways of your new home . You will continue to learn English and perhaps Dutch . You will live . But in exchange for what I give , you will obey me whether I come to you tomorrow or forty years from now . "
27222	27228	27123	27123	he	74	“ What must I do ? ”
27229	27285	27139	27139	Doro	60	“ I do n't know yet . Perhaps I will give you a homeless child to care for or a series of children . Perhaps you will give shelter to adults who need it . Perhaps you will carry messages or deliver goods or hold property for me . Perhaps anything . Anything at all . ”
27286	27294	27123	27123	he	74	" Wrong things as well as right ? ”
27295	27298	27123	27123	he	74	“ Yes . ”
27299	27317	27139	27139	Doro	60	“ Perhaps I will not obey then . Even a slave must follow his own thoughts sometimes . ”
27318	27324	27123	27123	he	74	“ That is your decision , ”
27328	27337	27325	27325	Doro	60	“ What will you do ? Kill me ? ”
27338	27341	27342	27342	Okoye	74	“ Yes . ”
27356	27361	27362	27362	he	74	“ I will obey , ”
27377	27392	27365	27365	He	74	" I wish to marry . But must the white man make the ceremony ? ”
27393	27399	27365	27365	He	74	“ Shall I do it ? ”
27400	27403	27404	27404	Okoye	74	“ Yes . ”
27845	27858	27826	27826	they	961	“ What have you done to them to make them so afraid ? ”
27869	27872	27873	27873	Doro	60	" Nothing , "
27877	27891	27873	27873	Doro	60	“ You have seen me with them . I 've harmed no one . ”
27909	27920	27921	27921	he	60	“ You do not know what this ship could be , ”
27983	27986	27987	27987	Doro	60	“ Waste ! ”
27992	28010	27987	27987	Doro	60	“ But those ships carry slaves for sale . My people are only for my own use . ”
28021	28034	28035	28035	she	61	" Shall I be glad that your slaves will not be wasted ? ”
28038	28051	28035	28035	she	61	“ Or shall I fear the uses you will find for them ? ”
28298	28309	28310	28310	she	61	“ What do you do when you gather with them ? ”
28331	28334	28335	28335	he	60	“ Nothing , ”
28339	28347	28335	28335	he	60	“ Then ... why do you gather ? ”
28348	28354	28355	28355	he	60	“ We might be needed , ”
28358	28377	28355	28355	he	60	“ The men I gather with are my sons . They have special abilities that could be useful . ”
28397	28402	28403	28403	he	60	“ Leave them alone , ”
28406	28429	28403	28403	he	60	“ Isaac is the best of them , safe and stable . The others are not safe — not even for you . "
29264	29270	29271	29271	he	60	“ Were you on deck ? ”
29278	29283	29275	29275	She	61	“ Then you saw . ”
29293	29299	29284	29284	She	61	" What did I see ? ”
29300	29308	29309	29309	he	60	“ The very best of my sons , ”
29313	29340	29309	29309	he	60	“ Isaac doing what he was born to do . He brought us through the storm — faster than any ship was ever intended to move . "
29341	29344	29284	29284	She	61	" How ? ”
29345	29348	29349	29349	Doro	60	" How ! ”
29354	29373	29349	29349	Doro	60	“ How do you change your shape , woman . How have you lived for three hundred years ? "
29399	29405	29393	29393	he	60	“ Whose place is this ? ”
29406	29411	29413	29413	Doro	60	“ The captain 's , ”
29415	29434	29413	29413	Doro	60	" He 'll have to make do with less for a while . You stay here . Rest . ”
29435	29443	29444	29444	He	60	“ Are all your sons so powerful ? ”
29448	29485	29444	29444	He	60	“ Your mind is leaping around tonight . But that 's not surprising , I suppose . My other sons do other things . None of them manage their abilities as well as Isaac , though . ”
30537	30540	30531	30531	he	2683	“ Anyanwu ! ”
30695	30698	30699	30699	he	60	“ Come , ”
30702	30718	30699	30699	he	60	“ Kill again . It has been a long time since I was a woman . ”
30764	30768	30769	30769	he	60	“ Control yourself , ”
30772	30777	30769	30769	he	60	“ Become a woman ! "
31047	31053	31061	31061	his	60	" Why is Isaac here ? "
31068	31087	31061	31061	his	60	“ The other one brought him . Lale Sachs . He said you sent Isaac to me . ... "
31093	31112	31088	31088	She	61	“ No . He did not say it , he ... he was in my thoughts , he ... "
31113	31117	31118	31118	She	61	“ I know . ”
31158	31166	31167	31167	She	61	“ What else did he tell you ? ”
31178	31211	31212	31212	She	61	“ I do not know . He showed an image of me lying with Isaac , then lying with him . He made me see it — almost made me want it . ”
31217	31243	31212	31212	She	61	“ When I tried to send him away without ... harming him , he did another thing . ... Doro , I must have food ! ”
31255	31259	31260	31260	he	1059	“ Stay here , ”
31264	31271	31260	31260	he	1059	" I 'll bring you something . "
31445	31450	31451	31451	Doro	60	“ Food , Anyanwu , ”
31567	31574	31576	31576	Doro	60	“ Tell me all that happened , ”
31638	31653	31633	31633	his	60	“ Sleep now , Anyanwu . I will take Lale away , and Isaac . ”
31654	31657	31674	31674	He	60	“ But ... "
31658	31673	31674	31674	He	60	“ Sleep . You are almost asleep now , almost talking in your sleep . "
31685	31691	31692	31692	she	61	“ What happened to him ? ”
31695	31708	31692	31692	she	61	“ He overextended himself just as you did . He will heal . ”
31709	31717	31674	31674	He	60	" He is cold ... so cold . ”
31718	31753	31692	31692	she	61	“ You would warm him if I left him here . You would warm him as Lale intended . Even your strength would not be enough to stop him once he began to awaken . ”
31864	31871	31872	31872	he	60	" It was for your protection , ”
31876	31949	31872	31872	he	60	“ Everyone aboard has been warned against molesting you . My sons have been doubly warned . Lale chose to ignore me . I can not seem to breed stupidity out of some of my people . He thought it would be interesting to watch when Isaac came to as hungry for a woman as you were for food . He thought perhaps he would have you too when Isaac had finished . ”
31950	31965	32027	32028	Wild Seed	84	" But how could he reach out and change the thoughts in my mind ? ”
31966	32026	32027	32028	Wild Seed	84	" It was his special ability . I 've had men who were better at itgood enough to control you absolutely , even control your changes . You would be no more than clay for such a man to mold . But Lale was the best of his generation to survive . His kind often do n't survive long . "
32029	32035	32036	32036	Anyanwu	61	" I can understand that ! ”
32039	32046	32047	32047	Doro	60	" No , you ca n't , ”
32051	32056	32047	32047	Doro	60	“ But you will . ”
32212	32228	32207	32207	She	61	“ What shall we do now , Doro ? What will you do with me ? ”
32229	32237	32238	32238	he	1072	“ What shall I do with you ? ”
32260	32267	32256	32256	she	61	“ I have killed your son . ”
32268	32278	32279	32279	She	61	“ Do you think I blame you for that ? ”
32288	32295	32296	32296	Doro	60	" I wanted him to live , ”
32299	32354	32296	32296	Doro	60	“ His kind are so troublesome and so short - lived . ... He has fathered only three children . I wanted more from him , but , Anyanwu , if you had not killed him , if he had succeeded in what he meant to do , I would have killed him myself . ”
32365	32375	32355	32355	She	61	“ Could you have done it ? Your son ? ”
32376	32379	32380	32380	he	60	“ Anyone , ”
32396	32402	32403	32403	he	60	" I control powerful people , ”
32406	32450	32403	32403	he	60	" My people . The destruction they can cause if they disobey me is beyond your imagining . Any one of them , any group of them who refuse to obey is useless to me and dangerous to the rest of my people . ”
32475	32493	32467	32467	he	60	“ Come . Kill again . It has been a long time since I was a woman ! ”
32613	32621	32610	32610	they	2648	" he told her . his hunger ? ”
32622	32634	32648	32648	his	60	" Is he ? What did he do for his hunger ? ”
32635	32643	32648	32648	his	60	“ Endured it until it went away . ”
32683	32691	32692	32692	she	61	“ You should get him a wife , ”
32700	32703	32704	32704	he	60	“ Soon , ”
32962	32965	32966	32966	she	61	“ You ? ”
32973	32978	32979	32979	Isaac	84	“ You do this ? ”
33173	33179	33180	33180	he	60	“ What are you doing ! ”
33211	33214	33215	33215	she	61	“ Tomorrow , ”
33218	33256	33215	33215	she	61	“ you will tell Isaac how to help me , and I will swim with the fish ! I will be a fish ! I can do it now ! I have wanted to for so long . "
33257	33265	33266	33266	Curiosity	94	" How do you know you can ? ”
33294	33306	33307	33307	she	61	“ Messages as clear and fine as those in your books , ”
33349	33359	33360	33360	she	61	“ It seems that you could misunderstand your books , ”
33363	33394	33360	33360	she	61	“ Other men made them . Other men can lie or make mistakes . But the flesh can only tell me what it is . It has no other story . ”
33395	33403	33404	33404	he	60	“ But how do you read it ? ”
33422	33458	33416	33416	he	60	“ My body reads it — reads everything . Did you know that fish breathes air as we do ? I thought it would breathe water like the ones we caught and dried at home . ”
33459	33465	33466	33466	Doro	60	“ It was a dolphin , ”
33469	33505	33466	33466	Doro	60	“ But it was more like a land thing than a fish . Inside , it is much like a land animal . The changes I make will not be as great as I thought . ”
33506	33521	33522	33522	She	61	“ Did you have to eat leopard flesh to learn to become a leopard ? ”
33527	33601	33522	33522	She	61	" No , I could see what the leopard was like . I could mold myself into what I saw . I was not a true leopard , though , until I killed one and ate a little of it . At first , I was a woman pre- 72 Wild Seed tending to be a leopard - clay molded into leopard shape . Now when I change , I am a leopard . "
33602	33611	33612	33612	He	60	“ And now you will be a dolphin . ”
33617	33636	33612	33612	He	60	“ You can not know how valuable you are to me . Shall I let you do this ? ”
33652	33659	33660	33660	she	61	“ It is a harmless thing , ”
33663	33677	33660	33660	she	61	“ A dangerous thing . What do you know of the sea ? ' “
33725	33726	33709	33709	he	84	” “
33735	33922	33923	33923	I	0	” She cast about for a reason she could put into words , a reason other than the wrenching longing she had felt when she watched the dolphins leaping and diving . It was like the days at home when she had watched eagles fly until she could no longer stand to only watch . She had killed an eagle and eaten and learned and flown as no human was ever meant to fly . She had flown away , escaping her town , her duties , her kinsmen . But after a while , she had flown back to her people . Where else could she go ? Afterward , though , when the seasons with them grew long and the duties tiresome , when the kinsmen by themselves became a great tribe , she would escape again . She would fly . There was danger . Men hunted her and once had nearly killed her . She made an exceptionally large , handsome eagle . But fear never kept her out of the sky . Nor would it keep her out of the water . "
33927	33932	33933	33933	I	0	” she told Doro . "
33947	33953	33940	33940	you	1097	” Doro shook his head . "
33975	33976	33955	33955	you	0	” “
33979	34061	33955	33955	you	0	” she said seriously , and was very much relieved when he laughed aloud . Better to amuse him than to anger him . The next day she stood by the rail , watching Doro and Isaac argue in English . It was Isaac who did most of the arguing . Doro said only a few words , and then later repeated them exactly . Anyanwu could find only one word in what Isaac said that was repeated . The word was "
34064	34094	34095	34095	Isaac	84	" and Isaac said it with vehemence . But he stopped when he saw how little attention Doro was paying to him . And Doro turned to face her . "
34100	34108	34095	34095	Isaac	84	" he told her . Wild Seed 73 “
34113	34114	34110	34110	he	84	" “
34127	34128	34118	34118	I	0	" “
34137	34138	34131	34131	you	0	" "
34147	34185	34142	34142	I	0	” His attitude puzzled her . He was not angry , not even annoyed . He did not even seem to be as concerned for her as Isaac was , and yet he said he valued her . “
34191	34195	34142	34142	I	0	” she asked . "
34199	34203	34204	34207	A large flesh eater	1100	” Doro said . “
34225	34226	34227	34227	You	0	” "
34236	34243	34227	34227	You	0	” He looked at the water . “
34255	34260	34227	34227	You	0	” he told her . “
34266	34267	34227	34227	You	0	" “
34279	34280	34268	34268	You	0	” "
34283	34284	34268	34268	You	0	" “
34287	34288	34289	34289	I	0	” "
34301	34331	34289	34289	I	0	" He reminded her of one of her sons who , when he was very young had thrown several fowls into the river to see whether they could swim . “
34341	34345	34337	34337	they	1104	” Doro said . “
34354	35922	35923	35923	Doro	60	” Anyanwu tore off her cloth and dived into the sea before her confidence deserted her entirely . There , she transformed herself as quickly as was comfortable . She became the dolphin whose flesh she had eaten . And she was moving through the water alongside the ship , propelling her long , sleek body forward with easy beats of her tail . She was seeing differently , her eyes now on the sides of her head instead of in front . Her head had extended itself into a hard beak . She was breathing differently — or rather , she was not breathing at all until she felt the need and found herself surfacing in a slow forward roll that exposed her blowhole - nose briefly and allowed her to expel her breath and take new air into her lungs . She observed herself minutely , saw that her dolphin body used the air it breathed much more efficiently than an ordinary human body . The dolphin body knew tricks her own human body had taken time and pain to learn . How to expel and renew a much larger portion of the air in its lungs with each breath . How to leach more of the usable portion of that air from the rest , the waste , and use it to fuel the body . Other things . 74 Wild Seed None of it was new to her , but she thought she would have learned it all much sooner and more easily with the help of a bit of dolphin flesh . Instead , she had had only men who attempted to drown her . She reveled in the strength and speed of her new body , and in its keen hearing . In her human shape , she kept her hearing abnormally keen — kept all her senses keen . But dolphin hearing was superior to anything she had ever created in herself . As a dolphin , she could close her eyes and perceive an only slightly diminished world around her with her ears . She could make sounds and they would come back to her as echoes bearing with them the story of all that lay before her . She had never imagined such hearing . Finally , she directed her attention from herself to the other dolphins . She had heard them too , chattering not far from her , keeping alongside the ship as she did . Strangely , their chatter sounded more human now — more like speech , like a foreign speech . She swam toward them slowly , uncertainly . How did they greet strangers ? How would they greet one small , ignorant female ? If they were speaking among themselves somehow , they would think her mute — or mad . A dolphin swam to meet her , paralleled her , observing her out of one lively eye . This was a male , she realized , and she watched him with interest . After a moment , he swam closer and rubbed his body against hers . Dolphin skin , she discovered , was pleasantly sensitive . It was not scaly as was the skin of true fish which she had never imitated , but whose bodies she understood . The male brushed her again , chattering in a way she felt was questioning , then swam away . She turned , checking the position of the ship , and saw that by keeping up with the dolphins , she was also keeping up with it . She swam after the male . There were advantages , she thought , to being a female animal . The males of some species fought each other , mindlessly possessive of territory or females . She could remember being bullied as a female animal , being pursued by persistent males , but only in her true woman - shape could she remember being seriously hurt by malesmen . It was only accident that made her a female dolphin ; she had eaten the flesh of a female . But it was a fortunate accident . A very small dolphin , a baby , she assumed , came to make her acquaintance , and she swam slowly , allowing it to investigate her . Eventually , its mother called it away , and she was alone again . Alone , but surrounded by creatures like herself - creatures she was Wild Seed 75 finding it harder to think of as animals . Swimming with them was like being with another people . A friendly people . No slavers with brands and chains here . No Doro with gentle , terrible threats to her children , to her . As time passed , several dolphins approached to touch her , rub themselves against her , get acquainted . When the male who had touched her first returned , she was startled to realize that she recognized him . His touch was his touch — not quite like that of any of the others as they were not quite like each other . Suddenly , he leaped high out of the water and arced back , landing some distance ahead of her . She wondered why she had not tried this herself and leaped a short distance . Her dolphin body was wonderfully agile . She seemed to fly through the air , plunging back smoothly and leaping again without strain or weariness . This was the best body she had ever shaped for herself . If only dolphin speech came as easily as dolphin movement . Some part of her mind wondered why it did not , wondered whether Doro was superior to her in this . Did he gain a new language , new knowledge when he took a new body - since he actually did possess the body , not merely duplicate it ? Her male dolphin came to touch her again and drove all thoughts of Doro from her mind . She understood that the dolphin 's interest had become more than casual . He stayed close to her now , touching her , matching his movements with her own . She realized that she did not mind his attention . She had avoided animal matings in the past . She was a woman . Intercourse with an animal was abomination . She would feel unclean reverting to her human form with the seed of a male animal inside her . But now ... it was as though the dolphins were not animals . She performed a kind of dance with the male , moving and touching , certain that no human ceremony had ever drawn her in so quickly . She felt both eager and restrained , both willing and hesitant . She would accept him , had already accepted him . He was surely no more strange than the ogbanje , Doro . Now seemed to be a time for strange matings . She continued the dance , wishing she had a song to go with it . The male seemed to have a song . She wondered whether he would leave her after the mating , and thought he probably would . But his would not be the greatest leave - taking . He would not leave the 76 Wild Seed group as she would , deserting everyone . But that was something to think about in the future . It did not matter . Only what was happening now mattered . Then , suddenly , there was a man in the water . Startled , both Anyanwu and her male swam a short distance away , their dance interrupted . The group of dolphins shied away from the man , but he pursued them , sometimes in the water , sometimes above it . He did not swim or leap or dive , but somehow arrowed through water and air holding his body still , apparently not using his muscles . Finally , Anyanwu separated herself from the school and approached the man . It was Isaac , she knew . He looked very different to her now — a clumsy thing , stiff and strange , but not remarkably ugly or frightening . He was a threat , though . He had had no reason to lose his taste for dolphin flesh , but she had . He might make another kill if she did not distract him . She turned and swam to him , approaching very slowly so that he would see her and understand that she meant no harm . She was certain that he could not distinguish her from any other dolphin . She swam in a small circle around where he hovered now , just above the water . He spoke in low , strange tones , said her name several times before she recognized it . Then , without stopping to wonder how she did it , she brought herself upright on her tail for a moment and managed a kind of nod . She swam to him , and he lowered himself into the water . She swam past his side , near enough to be touched . He caught her dorsal fin and said something else . She listened closely . “
35931	36058	35923	35923	Doro	60	" That was that . She looked back at the dolphins regretfully , trying to pick out her male . She found him surprisingly nearby - dangerously nearby . It would have been so good to return to him , stay with him , just for a while . The mating would have been good . She wondered whether Doro had known or suspected what she was doing when he sent Isaac out to get her . It did not matter . Isaac was here , and he had to be taken away before he noticed the other dolphin so temptingly near . She swam back toward the ship , allowing him to keep his hold on her fin . She did not mind towing him . “
36065	36074	36059	36059	I	0	” he said when they reached the ship . “
36081	36727	36076	36076	I	0	” He rose straight out of the water and drifted onto the ship . He could fly without wings as easily as he could direct the ship out of a Wild Seed 77 storm . She wondered whether he could be sick and need a woman after this too . Then something touched her , gripped her firmly but not painfully , lifted her out of the water . It was not , as she had thought , like being lifted by a net or by the arms of men . There was no special feeling of pressure on any part of her body . It was like being held and supported by the air itself — softness that seemed to envelope her entire body , firmness that all her strength could not free her from . But she did not use her strength , did not struggle . She had seen the futility of the dolphin 's struggles the day before , and she had felt the speed of the great ship as it plunged through the storm , propelled by Isaac 's power . No strength of her muscles could resist such power . Besides , she trusted the boy . He handled her more carefully than he had the other dolphin , gestured crewmen back out of his way before he set her down gently on deck . Then the crewmen , Doro , and Isaac watched , fascinated , as she began to grow legs . She had had to absorb her legs almost completely , leaving only the useless detached hip bones natural to her dolphin body — as though the dolphin itself were slowly developing legs — or losing them . Now , she began with this large change . And her flippers began to look more like arms . Her neck , her entire body , grew slender again and her tiny excellent dolphin ears enlarged to become less efficient human ears . Her nose migrated back to her face and she absorbed her beak , her tail , and her fin . There were internal changes that those watching could not be aware of . And her gray skin changed color and texture . That change caused her to begin thinking about what she might have to do to herself if someday she decided to vanish into this land of white people that she was approaching . She would have to do some experimenting later . It was always useful to be able to camouflage oneself to hide or to learn the things people either would not or could not deliberately teach her about themselves . This when she could speak English well , of course . She would have to work harder at the language . When the transformation was complete , she stood up , and Doro handed her her cloth . Before the staring men , she wrapped it around her waist and tied it . It had been centuries since she had gone naked in the way of unmarried young girls . She felt ashamed now to be seen by so many men , but she understood that again , Doro wanted his people to see her power . If he could not breed stupidity out of them , he would frighten it out . 78 Wild Seed She looked around at them , allowing no hint of her shame to reach her expression . Why should they know what she felt ? She read awe in their expressions , and two who were near her actually stepped back when she looked at them . Then Doro hugged her wet body to him and she was able to relax . Isaac laughed aloud , breaking the tension , and said something to Doro . Doro smiled . In her language , he said : “
36735	36817	36076	36076	I	0	” She was caught by the intensity she could sense behind his words . It reminded her that his was more than an ordinary man 's desire for children . She could not help thinking of her own children , strong and healthy , but as short - lived and powerless as the children of any other woman . Could she give Doro what he wanted — what she herself had wanted for so long — children who would not die ? "
36827	36892	36819	36819	children	2692	” she whispered , but the words were more questioning than his had been . And strangely , Doro also seemed to become uncertain . She looked at him and caught a troubled expression on his face . He was staring out at the dolphins who were leaping again , some of them just ahead of the ship . He shook his head slowly . “
36897	36939	36819	36819	children	2692	" she asked . He looked away from the dolphins , and for a moment , his expression was so intense , so feral that she wondered if he hated the animals , or envied her because she could join them . "
36944	36956	36819	36819	children	2692	" she repeated . He seemed to force himself to smile . “
36959	38412	36819	36819	children	2692	” he said . He pulled her head to his shoulder reassuringly , and stroked her glossy , newly grown skullcap of hair . Unreassured , she accepted the caress and wondered why he was lying . CHAPTER 6 Anyanwu had too much power . In spite of Doro 's fascination with her , his first inclination was to kill her . He was not in the habit of keeping alive people he could not control absolutely . But if he killed her and took over her body , he would get only one or two children from her before he had to take a new body . Her longevity would not help him keep her body alive . He did not acquire the use of his victims ' special abilities with his transmigrations . He inhabited bodies . He consumed lives . That was all . Had he killed Lale , he would not have acquired the man 's thought - transfer ability . He would only have been able to pass on that ability to children of Lale 's body . And if he killed Anyanwu , he would not acquire her malleability , longevity , or healing . He would have only his own special ability lodged within her small , durable body until he began to hunger - hunger in a way Anyanwu and Isaac could never understand . He would hunger , and he would have to feed . Another life . A new body . Anyanwu would last him no longer than any other good kill . Therefore , Anyanwu must live and bear her valuable young . But she had too much power . In her dolphin form , and before that , in her leopard form , Doro had discovered that his mind could not find her . Even when he could see her , his mind , his tracking sense , told him she was not there . It was as though she had died , as though he confronted a true animal — a creature beyond his reach . And if he could not reach her , he could not kill her and take her body while she was in animal form . In her human shape , she was as vulnerable to him as anyone else , but as an animal , she was beyond him as animals had always been beyond him . He longed now for one of the animal sensitives his controlled breeding occasionally produced . These were people whose abilities extended to touching animal minds , receiving sensation and emotion from them , people who suffered every time someone wrung a chicken 's neck or gelded a 80 Wild Seed horse or slaughtered a pig . They led short , unenviable lives . Some times Doro killed them before they could waste their valuable bodies in suicide . But now , he could have used a living one . Without one , his control of Anyanwu was dangerously limited . And if Anyanwu ever discovered that limitation , she might run away from him whenever she chose . She might go the moment he demanded more of her than she was willing to give . Or she might go if she discovered that he meant to have both her and the children she had left behind in Africa . She believed her cooperation had bought their freedom - believed he would give up such potentially valuable people . If she found out the truth , she would surely run , and he would lose her . He had never before lost anyone in that way . He lost people to disease , accident , war , causes beyond his control . People were stolen from him or killed as had been his people of the savanna . This was bad enough . It was waste , and he intended to end much of it by bringing his people to less widely scattered communities in the Americas . But no individual had ever succeeded in escaping him . Individuals who ran from him were caught and most often killed . His own people knew better than to run from him . But Anyanwu , wild seed that she was , did not know . Yet . He would have to teach her , instruct her quickly and begin using her at once . He wanted as many children as he could get from her before it became necessary to kill her . Wild seed always had to be destroyed eventually . It could never conform as children born among his people conformed . But like no other wild seed , Anyanwu would learn to fear him and bend herself to his will . He would use her for breeding and healing . He would use her children , present and future , to create more acceptable long - lived types . The troublesome shape - changing ability could probably be bred out of her line if it appeared . The fact that it had not appeared so far told him he might be able to extinguish it entirely . But then , none of her special abilities had appeared among her children . They had inherited nothing more than potential - good blood that might produce special abilities after a few generations of inbreeding . Perhaps he would fail with them . Perhaps he would discover that Anyanwu could not be duplicated , or that there could be no longevity without shape - changing . Perhaps . But any finding , positive or negative , was generations away . Meanwhile , Anyanwu must never leam of his limitation , must Wild Seed 81 never know it was possible for her to escape him , avoid him , live free of him even as an animal . This meant he must not restrict her transformations any more strenuously than he restricted his children in the use of their abilities . She would not be permitted to show what she could do among ordinary people or harm his people except in self - defense . That was all . She would fear him , obey him , consider him almost omnipotent , but she would notice nothing in his attitude that might start her wondering . There would be nothing for her to notice . Thus , as the journey neared its end , he allowed Anyanwu and Isaac to indulge in wild , impossible play , using their abilities freely , behaving like the witch - children they were . They went into the water together several times when there was enough wind and Isaac was not needed to propel the ship . The boy was not fighting a storm now . He was able to handle the ship without overextending himself , able to expend energy cavorting in the water with a dolphin - shaped Anyanwu . Then Anyanwu took to the air as a great bird , and Isaac followed , doing acrobatics that Doro would never have permitted over land . Here , there was no one to shoot the boy out of the sky , no mob to chase him down and try to burn him as a witch . He had to restrain himself so much on land that Doro placed no restraints on him now . Doro worried about Anyanwu when she ventured under water alone - worried that he would lose her to sharks or other predators . But when she was finally attacked by a shark , it was near the surface . She suffered only a single wound which she sealed at once . Then she managed to ram her beak hard into the shark 's gills . She must also have managed to take an undolphinlike bite out of the shark , since she immediately shifted to the sleek , deadly shark form . As it happened , the change was unnecessary . The shark was crippled , perhaps dying . But the change had been made , and made too quickly . Anyanwu had to feed . With strength and speed she tore the true shark to pieces and gorged herself on it . When she became a woman again , Doro could find no sign of the wound she had suffered . He found her drowsy and content , not at all the shaking , tormented creature who had killed Lale . This time , her drive to feed had been quickly satisfied . Apparently , that was important . . She adopted the dolphins , refusing to let Isaac bring any more aboard to be killed . “
38418	38430	38413	38413	They	1113	” she insisted in her fast- 82 Wild Seed improving English . “
38436	39004	38413	38413	They	1113	” She swore she would have nothing more to do with Isaac if he killed another of them . And Isaac , who loved dolphin flesh , brought no more dolphins aboard . Doro listened to the boy 's muttered complaints , smiled , and said nothing . Isaac listened to the crewmen 's complaints , shrugged , and gave them other fish . He continued to spend his spare time with Anyanwu , teaching her English , flying or swimming with her , merely being with her whenever he could . Doro neither encouraged nor discouraged this , though he did approve . He had been thinking a great deal about Isaac and Anyanwu - how well they got along in spite of their communication problems , in spite of their potentially dangerous abilities , in spite of their racial differences . Isaac would marry Anyanwu if Doro ordered it . The boy might even like the idea . And once Anyanwu accepted the marriage , Doro 's hold on her would be secure . The children would come — desirable , potentially multitalented children — and Doro could travel as he pleased to look after his other peoples . When he returned to his New York village of Wheatley , Anyanwu would still be there . Her children would hold her if her husband did not . She could become an animal or alter herself enough to travel freely among whites or Indians , but several children would surely slow her down . And she would not abandon them . She was too much a mother for that . She would stay — and if Doro found another man he wished to breed her with he could come to her wearing that man 's body . It would be a simple matter . What would not be simple would be giving Anyanwu her first hard lesson in obedience . She would not want to go to Isaac . Among her people , a woman could divorce her husband by running away from him and seeing that the bridewealth he had given for her was returned . Or her husband could divorce her by driving her away . If her husband was impotent , he could , with her consent , give her to another man so that she could bear children in her husband 's name . If her husband died , she could marry his successor , usually his oldest son as long as this was not also her own son . But there was no provision for what Doro planned to do give her to his son while he , Doro , was still alive . She considered Doro her husband now . No ceremony had taken place , but none was necessary . She was not a young girl passing from the hands of her father to those of her first husband . It was enough that she and Doro had chosen each other . She would think it wrong to go to Isaac . But her thinking would change as had the thinking of other powerful , self - willed was not a young gupas enough that she anger . But her thinking Wild Seed 83 people whom Doro had recruited . She would learn that right and wrong were what he said they were . At the place Doro had called “
39009	39025	38413	38413	They	1113	” everyone except the crew was to change ships , move to a pair of smaller "
39028	39033	38413	38413	They	1113	” to travel up the "
39036	39042	38413	38413	They	1113	" to Doro 's village of “
39045	39119	38413	38413	They	1113	" With less experience at absorbing change and learning new dialects if not new languages , Anyanwu thought she would have been utterly confused . She would have been frightened into huddling together with the slaves and looking around with suspicion and dread . Instead , she stood on deck with Doro , waiting calmly for the transfer to the new ships . Isaac and several others had gone ashore to make arrangements . “
39125	39141	38413	38413	They	1113	” she had asked Doro in English . She often tried to speak English now . “
39153	39387	39147	39147	Isaac	84	” he said . Which meant he did not know . That was good . Anyanwu hoped the wait would be long . Even she needed time to absorb the many differences of this new world . From where she stood she could see a few other large , square - rigged ships lying at anchor in the harbor . And there were smaller boats either moving under billowing , usually triangular sails or tied up at the long piers Doro had pointed out to her . But ships and boats seemed familiar to her now . She was eager to see how these new people lived on land . She had asked to go ashore with Isaac , but Doro had refused . He had chosen to keep her with him . She stared ashore longingly at the rows and rows of buildings , most two , three , even four stories high , and side against side as though like ants in a hill , the people could not bear to be far apart . In much of her own country , one could stand in the middle of a town and see little more than forest . The villages of the towns were well - organized , often long - established , but they were more a part of the land they occupied , less of an intrusion upon it . "
39397	39410	39147	39147	Isaac	84	” she asked , staring at the straight rows of pointed roofs . "
39423	39427	39147	39147	Isaac	84	" Doro said . “
39445	39452	39442	39443	a family	1122	” She looked around , startled . “
39462	39472	39442	39443	a family	1122	” 84 Wild Seed are as 1.9 she pleels to "
39501	39518	39644	39644	Doro	60	" He pointed to a place where the great concentration of buildings tapered off and ended . “
39523	39524	39644	39644	Doro	60	” "
39529	39530	39644	39644	Doro	60	” "
39547	39643	39644	39644	Doro	60	" These English names were familiar to her because he and Isaac had told her about them . Barley for making the beer that the crew drank so much of , oats for feeding the horses the people of this country rode , wheat for bread , maize for bread and for eating in other ways , tobacco for smoking , fruits and vegetables , nuts and herbs . Some of these things were only foreign versions of foods already known to her , but many were as new to her as the anthill city . "
39654	39658	39644	39644	Doro	60	” she pleaded . “
39683	39761	39762	39762	I	0	" Doro rested one arm comfortably around her . He liked to touch her before others more than any man she had ever known , but it did not seem that any of his people were amused or contemptuous of his behavior . Even the slaves seemed to accept whatever he did as the proper thing for him to do . And Anyanwu enjoyed his touches even now when she thought they were more imprisoning than caressing . "
39773	39777	39762	39762	I	0	” he said . “
39832	39833	39812	39812	I	0	” “
39842	39843	39844	39844	Most	512	” "
39874	39878	39871	39872	a slave	226	” She frowned . “
39884	39885	39881	39881	Isaac	84	” "
39924	39936	39922	39922	Indian	87	” She was silent for a moment , then asked fearfully , “
39942	39943	39945	39945	you	0	” “
39949	39956	39945	39945	you	0	” He looked down at her . “
39968	39973	39959	39959	I	0	” He seemed pleased . “
40011	40012	40004	40004	they	184	” "
40023	40030	40017	40017	they	184	” she said . He shrugged . “
40039	40040	40032	40032	blacks	3099	” “
40043	40044	40032	40032	blacks	3099	” "
40068	40069	40051	40051	I	0	” "
40072	40076	40051	40051	I	0	” Doro said . “
40092	40184	40083	40083	You	0	” She looked at him quickly to see whether he was laughing at her -speaking of her power and at the same time reminding her of his own power to control her . But he was watching the approach of a small , fast - moving boat . As the boat came alongside , its one passenger and his several bundles rose straight up and drifted onto the ship . Isaac , of course . Anyanwu realized suddenly that the boy had used neither oars nor sails to propel the boat . “
40190	40207	40185	40185	You	1153	” Doro told him sharply , and the boy dropped , startled , to the deck . “
40213	40217	40185	40185	You	1153	” he said . “
40227	40325	40326	40326	You	1157	" He unrolled one of the bundles that had drifted aboard with him , and Anyanwu saw that it was a long , full , bright blue petticoat of the kind given to the slave women when they grew cold as the ship traveled north . Anyanwu could protect herself from the cold without such coverings though she had cut a petticoat apart to make new cloths from it . She disliked the idea of covering her body so completely , smothering herself , she called it . She thought the slave women looked foolish so covered . “
40332	40338	40326	40326	You	1157	” Isaac was telling her . “
40356	40357	40351	40353	the people here	1158	" “
40362	40376	40351	40353	the people here	1158	” she asked . Isaac glanced at Doro uncomfortably , and Doro smiled . “
40380	40387	40351	40353	the people here	1158	" Isaac said after a moment . “
40402	40449	40490	40490	you	1157	” Anyanwu touched the petticoat . The material felt smooth and cool beneath her fingers — not like the drab , coarse cloth of the slave women 's petticoats . And the color pleased her — a brilliant blue that went well with her dark skin . “
40452	40456	40490	40490	you	1157	” Isaac said . “
40460	40464	40490	40490	you	1157	” 86 Wild Seed “
40472	40488	40490	40490	you	1157	” Doro asked . Isaac blushed dark beneath his tan and glared at his father . “
40496	40502	40490	40490	you	1157	” Anyanwu demanded , alarmed . “
40507	40512	40513	40513	I	0	” he said defensively . "
40530	40552	40520	40520	I	0	” Anyanwu glanced at Doro uncertainly , then stepped away from him as she saw how he was looking at Isaac . “
40570	40574	40520	40520	I	0	” Doro said , “
40582	40596	40578	40578	them	1160	" Isaac licked his lips , put the petticoat into Anyanwu 's arms . “
40600	40605	40607	40607	they	1160	” he said softly . “
40610	40678	40607	40607	they	1160	” Doro shook his head , said something harshly in a language other than English . Isaac jumped . He glanced at Anyanwu as though to see whether she had understood . She stared back at him blankly , and he managed a weak smile of what she supposed to be relief at her ignorance . Doro gathered Isaac 's bundles and spoke in English to Anyanwu . “
40688	40689	40607	40607	they	1160	” "
40702	40762	40763	40764	Another woman	1161	" she muttered , and was startled when he pushed her toward the hatchway . In their cabin , Doro seemed to relax and let go of his anger . He carefully unwrapped the other bundles . A second petticoat , a woman 's waistcoat , a cap , underclothing , stockings , shoes , some simple gold jewelry ... "
40768	40778	40779	40779	Your	1157	” Anyanwu said , lapsing into her own language . "
40783	40787	40788	40788	Isaac	84	” Doro said . "
40799	40800	40794	40794	He	84	” "

40857	40858	40851	40851	He	84	” “
40877	40884	40885	40885	You	1157	” Doro held up the petticoat . “
40891	40895	40885	40885	You	1157	” she asked . “
40903	40904	40885	40885	You	1157	” "
40911	40915	40908	40908	my	0	” he said . “
41010	41021	40997	40997	He	84	” She smiled , laid one hand on his arm . “
41043	41044	41035	41035	He	84	” “
41051	41055	41045	41045	He	84	” Doro said . "
41071	41075	41068	41069	a man	2743	” She shrugged . “
41108	41115	41098	41098	you	1177	” Doro smiled , denying nothing . “
41121	41125	41098	41098	you	1177	” he said . “
41129	41140	41098	41098	you	1177	” She stripped , eyeing the new clothing with distaste . "
41148	41159	41098	41098	you	1177	” he told her as he began helping her dress . “
41192	41193	41237	41238	a woman	2710	” “
41198	41199	41200	41201	A people	1182	” “

41260	41273	41254	41254	I	0	" She looked at his tall , straight black man 's body . “
41290	41312	41287	41287	He	0	“ It would be hard for me to imagine you as a man if I had n't seen you that way . ”
41313	41316	41317	41317	She	1187	“ But ... "
41322	41345	41317	41317	She	1187	“ You would make a bad woman , however you looked . I would not want to see you as a woman . ”
41346	41365	41287	41287	He	0	“ You will , though , sooner or later . Let me show you how to fasten that . ”
41560	41568	41569	41569	she	1187	" Can you braid it for me ? ”
41573	41585	41569	41569	she	1187	" Surely you should be able to do that , too . "
41586	41592	41593	41593	he	60	“ Of course I can , "
41620	41626	41627	41627	he	60	“ But I will not , ”
41630	41657	41658	41658	He	60	“ You look better with it loose and combed this way . I used to live with an island tribe who wore their hair this way . ”
41661	41679	41658	41658	He	60	“ What do you do with your hair when you change ? Does it change , too ? ”
41680	41733	41756	41756	He	60	" No , I take it into myself . Other creatures have other kinds of hair . I feed on my hair , nails , any other parts of my body that I can not use . Then later , I re - create them . You have seen me growing hair . ”
41734	41755	41756	41756	He	60	" I did not know whether you were growing it or it was . . . somehow the same hair . ”
41763	41770	41756	41756	He	60	“ Here , look at yourself . ”
41828	41835	41836	41836	she	1194	“ It would be better braided , ”
41839	41854	41836	41836	she	1194	“ A woman of the age I seem to be would braid her hair . ”
41855	41859	41860	41860	He	60	“ Another time . ”
41870	41902	41860	41860	He	60	“ Either Isaac has not looked at your ears , or he thinks it would be no trouble for you to create small holes to attach these earrings . Can you ? "
41951	41959	41960	41960	she	1194	“ Touch where the holes should be , ”
41981	41987	41988	41988	she	1194	“ What is the matter ? ”
41997	42028	41994	41995	Wild Seed	84	“ Nothing . I ... I suppose it 's just that I 've never touched you before while you were changing . The texture of your flesh is ... different . "
42029	42047	41994	41995	Wild Seed	84	" Is not the texture of clay different when it is pliable and when it has set ? ”
42048	42052	42053	42053	She	1194	“ ... yes . "
42056	42066	42053	42053	She	1194	“ Touch me now . The strangeness is gone . "
42082	42089	42090	42090	he	60	“ It was not unpleasant before , ”
42093	42097	42090	42090	he	60	“ Only unexpected . ”
42098	42104	42105	42105	she	1194	“ But not truly unfamiliar , "
42122	42131	42108	42108	She	1194	“ But it is . I 've never ... "
42144	42158	42159	42159	She	1194	“ What are you saying , woman ? What have you been doing ? ”
42163	42179	42180	42180	She	1194	“ Only giving you pleasure . You have told me how well I please you . ”
42185	42214	42182	42182	her	1194	“ Once I married a man who had seven wives . When he had married me , though , he did not go as often to the others . "
42247	42250	42251	42251	he	60	“ Someday , ”
42257	42279	42251	42251	he	60	" we will both change . I will become a woman and find out whether you make an especially talented man . ”
42280	42283	42284	42284	She	1194	“ No ! ”
42319	42328	42329	42329	He	60	“ We will not do such a thing ! ”
42355	42364	42329	42329	He	60	“ Doro , we will not do it ! "
42365	42369	42370	42370	he	60	“ All right , ”
42374	42386	42370	42370	he	60	“ It was only a suggestion . You might enjoy it . ”
42387	42390	42391	42391	He	60	“ No ! ”
42394	42402	42403	42403	she	1194	“ It would be a vile thing , ”
42406	42411	42403	42403	she	1194	“ Surely an abomination . ”
42412	42416	42417	42417	he	60	“ All right , ”
42477	42485	42486	42486	she	1194	" I will show Isaac the clothing , ”
42493	42496	42490	42490	He	60	“ Go . ”
42864	42871	42872	42872	she	61	“ Thank you for these things , ”
42878	42886	42887	42887	he	84	“ They make you even more beautiful , ”
42891	42901	42872	42872	she	61	“ I am like a prisoner . All bound . ”
42902	42918	42919	42919	Anyanwu	61	“ You 'll get used to it . Now you can be a real lady . "
42927	42931	42932	42932	she	61	“ Real lady ? ”
42937	42943	42932	42932	she	61	“ What was I before ? ”
42950	42961	42944	42944	Isaac	84	“ I mean you look like a New York lady . "
42998	43008	43009	43009	she	61	“ Tell me what I was before , Isaac , ”
43012	43028	43009	43009	she	61	“ And tell me the word you used before : Civilization . What is civilization ? ”
43047	43054	43055	43055	he	84	“ Before , you were Anyanwu , ”
43058	43124	43055	43055	he	84	“ mother of Idon't - know - how - many children , priestess to your people , respected and valued woman of your town . But to the people here , you would be a savage , almost an animal if they saw you wearing only your cloth . Civilization is the way one 's own people live . Savagery is the way foreigners live . ”
43129	43145	43125	43125	He	84	" You 're already a chameleon , Anyanwu . You understand what I 'm saying . ”
43146	43149	43150	43150	She	1216	“ Yes . ”
43157	43195	43150	43150	She	1216	" But in a land where most of the people are white , and of the few blacks , most are slaves , can only a few pieces of cloth make me a ' real lady . ' ”
43196	43202	43203	43203	he	84	" In Wheatley I can ! ”
43207	43223	43203	43203	he	84	“ I 'm white and black and Indian , and I live there without trouble . ”
43224	43235	43236	43236	He	84	“ But you look like a ‘ real man . ' ”
43239	43246	43247	43247	he	84	“ I 'm not like you , ”
43250	43260	43247	43247	he	84	“ I ca n't help the way I look . ”
43261	43264	43265	43265	she	1217	“ No , ”
43268	43339	43265	43265	she	1217	" And it does n't matter anyway . Wheatley is Doro 's ' American ' village . He dumps all the people he ca n't find places for in his pure families on us . Mix and stir . No one can afford to worry about what anyone else looks like . They do n't know who Doro might mate them with or what their own children might look like . ”
43347	43356	43357	43357	she	61	“ Do people even marry as he says ? ”
43360	43367	43357	43357	she	61	“ Does no one resist him ? ”
43377	43383	43384	43384	he	84	“ Wild seed resists sometimes , ”
43388	43396	43384	43384	he	84	“ But he always wins . Always . "
43457	43463	43464	43464	Isaac	84	“ People run away sometimes , ”
43473	43530	43531	43531	He	84	“ But he always catches them and usually wears their bodies back to their home towns so that their people can see and be warned . The only sure way to escape him and cheat him out of the 92 Wild Seed satisfaction of wearing your body , I guess , is my mother 's way . "
43534	43539	43531	43531	He	84	“ She hanged herself . ”
43593	43601	43602	43602	she	61	" Your mother died because of Doro ? ”
43612	43679	43609	43609	He	84	" I do n't know , really . I was only four . But I do n't think so . She was like Lale — able to send and receive thoughts . But she was better at it than he was , especially better at receiving . From Wheatley , sometimes she could hear people in New York City over a hundred and fifty miles away . "
43685	43745	43680	43680	He	84	“ A long way . A damned long way for that kind of thing . She could hear anything . But sometimes she could n't shut things out . I remember I was afraid of her . She used to crouch in a corner and hold her head or scratch her face bloody and scream and scream and scream . ”
43749	43771	43746	43746	He	84	“ That 's all I remember of her . That 's the only image that comes when I think of her . "
43852	43864	43865	43865	she	61	" Isaac , has there been nothing good in your life ? ”
43872	43897	43898	43898	He	84	" There 's been a lot . Doro , the foster parents he found me when I was little , the travel , this . ”
43906	43940	43898	43898	He	84	“ It 's been good . I used to worry that I 'd be crazy like my mother or mad - dog vicious like Lale , but Doro always said I would n't . ”
43941	43947	43865	43865	she	61	“ How could he know ? ”
43948	43990	43991	43991	She	1230	“ He used a different body to father me . He wanted a different ability in me , and sometimes he knows exactly which families to breed together to get what he wants . I 'm glad he knew for me . ”
43994	44008	43991	43991	She	1230	“ I would not want to know you if you were like Lale . "
44173	44190	44169	44169	he	60	“ Do n't frighten them too badly , boy . Home is n't that far away . ”

45604	45611	45612	45613	the boy	485	" Anneke is near her transition , ”
45629	45630	45617	45618	Mrs. Waemans	105	” "
45637	45715	45716	45717	Mrs. Waemans	105	” Doro answered . Anneke Strycker was one of his daughters — a potentially good daughter . With luck , she would replace Lale when her transition was complete and her abilities mature . She lived now with her foster mother , Margaret Waemans , a big , physically powerful , mentally stable widow of fifty . No doubt , the woman needed all her resources to handle the young girl now . Isaac cleared his throat . “
45735	45784	45728	45728	She	105	” Doro nodded . Power came the way a child came — with agony . People in transition were open to every thought , every emotion , every pleasure , every pain from the minds of others . Their heads were filled with a continuous screaming jumble of mental “
45787	45902	45728	45728	She	105	" There was no peace , little sleep , many nightmares — everyone 's nightmares . Some of Doro 's best people — too many of themstopped at this stage . They could pass their potential on to their children if they lived long enough to have any , but they could not benefit from it themselves . They could never control it . They became hosts for Doro , or they became breeders . Doro brought them mates from distant unrelated settlements because that kind of crossbreeding most often produced children like Lale . Only great care and fantastic good luck produced a child like Isaac . Doro glanced at the boy fondly . “
45911	45916	45906	45906	Anneke	104	” he told him . “
45919	45925	45930	45931	Mrs. Waemans	105	” Isaac said with relief . “
45943	45947	45933	45933	she	105	” He hesitated . “
45956	45957	45933	45933	she	105	” “
45969	45970	45971	45971	My	0	” “
45974	45978	45971	45971	My	0	” Isaac said . “
45989	45990	45991	45991	She	105	” “
46004	46013	45991	45991	She	105	” Isaac glared at Doro in sudden anger . “
46038	46055	46035	46036	someone else	609	” Doro turned to look at him , and after a moment , Isaac looked away . “
46065	46070	46062	46062	you	1349	” Doro told him . “
46095	46096	46083	46083	I	0	” “
46111	46112	46101	46101	you	1349	” “
46126	46144	46145	46145	You	1349	" The boy 's eyes widened . He stopped walking , leaned against a tall maple tree . “
46171	46172	46162	46162	you	1349	" "
46176	46182	46162	46162	you	1349	” Doro stopped beside him . "
46188	46189	46184	46184	you	1349	” “
46200	46201	46193	46193	I	0	” “
46213	46214	46209	46209	She	105	” “
46218	46219	46209	46209	She	105	” “
46230	46286	46220	46220	You	60	” Doro shrugged . Worried as he was , it did not occur to him to share his concern with Isaac . Anyanwu would obey him or she would n't . He longed to be able to control her with some refinement of Lale 's power , but he could not — nor could Isaac . “
46294	46298	46220	46220	You	60	” Isaac said , “
46321	46322	46318	46318	me	0	” "
46326	46327	46318	46318	me	0	” “

46367	46368	46339	46339	I	0	” "
46376	46389	46339	46339	I	0	” Doro smiled a little , pleased by the boy 's concern . “
46395	46399	46390	46390	You	60	” he observed . “
46406	46407	46400	46400	You	60	” “
46419	46420	46414	46414	you	60	” “
46440	46441	46442	46442	You	60	” “

46520	46524	46525	46525	Married	1361	” Isaac said . “
46527	46538	46525	46525	Married	1361	” He shook his head , then began to smile . “
46542	46549	46525	46525	Married	1361	” Doro started toward the house . "
46552	46562	46525	46525	Married	1361	" Doro looked back at him . 98 Wild Seed "
46597	46598	46599	46599	Sarah	103	" “
46607	46608	46599	46599	Sarah	103	” "
46612	46618	46599	46599	Sarah	103	” Isaac glanced homeward guiltily . “
46625	46936	46623	46623	you	60	” Doro nodded , turned , and went in to Sarah Cutler 's linen - clothed , heavily laden table . Anyanwu watched carefully as the white woman placed first a clean cloth , then dishes and utensils on the long , narrow table at which the household was to eat . Anyanwu was glad that some of the food and the white people 's ways of eating it were familiar to her from the ship . She could sit down and have a meal without seeming utterly ignorant . She could not have cooked the meal , but that would come , too , in time . She would learn . For now , she merely observed and allowed the interesting smells to intensify her hunger . Hunger was familiar and good . It kept her from staring too much at the white woman , kept her from concentrating on her own nervousness and uncertainty in the new surroundings , kept her attention on the soup , thick with meat and vegetables , and the roast deer flesh -venison , the white woman had called it — and a huge fowl — a turkey . Anyanwu repeated the words to herself , reassured that they had become part of her vocabulary . New words , new ways , new foods , new clothing . . . She was glad of the cumbersome clothing , though , finally . It made her look more like the other women , black and white , whom she had seen in the village , and that was important . She had lived in enough different towns through her various marriages to know the necessity of learning to behave as others did . What was common in one place could be ridiculous in another and abomination in a third . Ignorance could be costly . "
46943	46994	46939	46939	I	0	” she asked the white woman . Doro had said the woman 's name once , very quickly , in introduction , then hurried off on business of his own . Anyanwu remembered the name -Sarahcutler — but was not certain she could say it correctly without hearing it again . “
46998	47005	47006	47007	Mrs. Cutler	107	” the woman said very distinctly . “
47009	47019	47006	47007	Mrs. Cutler	107	” Anyanwu frowned , confused . Which was right ? “
47023	47024	47020	47021	Mrs. Cutler	107	” “
47032	47033	47027	47027	You	0	” “
47040	47044	47034	47034	I	0	” Anyanwu shrugged . “
47049	47050	47045	47045	I	0	" “
47058	47062	47053	47053	you	0	” Wild Seed 99 “
47065	47078	47063	47063	Anyanwu	61	” She said it very slowly , but still the woman asked : “
47085	47087	47063	47063	Anyanwu	61	” . "
47107	47108	47101	47101	I	0	” “
47114	47115	47116	47116	Mbgafo	108	” “
47145	47146	47141	47141	I	0	” "
47150	47186	47141	47141	I	0	” The woman sighed , and Anyanwu smiled to herself . She had had to give five of her former names to Isaac before he shrugged and decided Anyanwu was a good name after all . “
47195	47211	47141	47141	I	0	” she asked . Sarah Cutler was beginning to put food on the table now . "
47214	47219	47141	47141	I	0	" the woman said . “
47232	47271	47224	47224	You	0	” She glanced at Anyanwu curiously . She did not stare , but allowed herself these quick curious glances . Anyanwu thought they each probably had an equal number of questions about the other . Sarah Cutler asked : "
47280	47282	47283	47283	Doro	60	" ? "
47312	47319	47320	47320	Sun	62	“ Your word for my name is “
47322	47323	47324	47324	she	1365	" ”
47327	47354	47324	47324	she	1365	“ Doro said he would find an English name for me , but I did not want one . Now he makes English of my name . ”
47364	47396	47359	47359	her	3698	“ You 're more fortunate than you know . With him taking such an interest in you , I 'm surprised you 're not already Jane or Alice or some such . ”
47400	47415	47397	47397	Anyanwu	61	“ He has not changed his own name . Why should he change mine ? ”
47429	47434	47435	47435	Anyanwu	61	“ What is Cutler ? ”
47438	47443	47435	47435	Anyanwu	61	“ What it means ? ”
47444	47447	47416	47417	The woman	2616	“ Yes . ”
47448	47470	47471	47471	She	2616	“ A cutler is a knifemaker . I suppose my husband had ancestors who were knifemakers . Here , taste this . ”
47489	47495	47496	47496	Anyanwu	61	" It is very good ! ”
47528	47537	47523	47523	Doro	60	“ Thank you . What is this called ? ”
47547	47567	47541	47542	The woman	2616	“ It 's a kind of cake I have n't made before special for Isaac and Doro 's homecoming . "
47568	47572	47573	47573	Anyanwu	61	" You said ... "
47579	47594	47573	47573	Anyanwu	61	“ You said your husband 's people were knifemakers . Cutler is his name ? ”
47595	47619	47541	47542	The woman	2616	“ Yes . Here , a woman takes the name of her husband after marriage . I was Sarah Wheatley before I married . ”
47620	47631	47541	47542	The woman	2616	“ Then Sarah is the name you keep for yourself . ”
47632	47635	47573	47573	Anyanwu	61	“ Yes . ”
47636	47645	47646	47647	The woman	2616	“ Shall I call you Sarah_your own name ? ”
47653	47661	47646	47647	The woman	2616	“ Shall I call you ... Mbgafo ? ”
47667	47689	47662	47662	She	2616	" If you like . But there are very many Mbgafos . That name only tells the day of my birth . ”
47690	47699	47573	47573	Anyanwu	61	“ Like . . . Monday or Tuesday ? ”
47700	47731	47646	47647	The woman	2616	“ Yes . You have seven . We have only four : Eke , Oye , Afo , Nkwo . People are often named for the day they were born . ”
47732	47745	47746	47746	Anyanwu	61	“ Your country must be overflowing with people of the same name . ”
47749	47758	47746	47746	Anyanwu	61	“ But many have other names as well . ”
47759	47767	47646	47647	The woman	2616	“ I suppose Anyanwu really is better . "
47768	47771	47772	47772	Anyanwu	61	“ Yes . ”
47775	47790	47772	47772	Anyanwu	61	“ Sarah is good too . A woman should have something of her own . ”
48276	48291	48263	48263	Doro	60	“ Do you miss the yams ? There are none quite like yours here . "
48292	48298	48299	48299	Her	61	“ It does not matter . ”
48463	48468	48469	48469	she	61	“ Where is Isaac ? ”
48473	48481	48471	48471	Doro	60	“ You said this was his home . ”
48482	48489	48490	48490	Doro	60	“ He 's with a friend , ”
48494	48501	48490	48490	Doro	60	" He 'll be in later . "
48502	48507	48508	48508	Sarah	103	“ He 'd better ! ”
48511	48525	48508	48508	Sarah	103	" His first night back and he ca n't come home to supper . ”
48526	48531	48532	48532	Doro	60	" He had reason , ”
48785	48788	48790	48795	a group of whites called French	1437	“ Praying Indians ”
48903	48908	48909	48909	he	60	“ Twice by Indians , ”
48912	48933	48909	48909	he	60	“ I happened to be here both times . We 've had peace since that second attack thirty years ago . ”
48934	48945	48946	48946	Sarah	112	“ That 's time enough for them to forget anything , ”
48949	48963	48946	48946	Sarah	112	“ Anyway , this is a new war . French and Praying Indians ! ”
48971	48974	48975	48976	her husband	2696	" Papists ! ”
48979	48982	48975	48976	her husband	2696	“ Bastards ! ”
48983	48995	48997	48999	the Mohawk girl	1434	“ My people could tell them what powerful spirits live here , ”
49028	49032	49033	49033	she	61	“ You see ? ”
49036	49045	49033	49033	she	61	“ I told you you were a spirit ! ”
49395	49403	49404	49404	he	60	“ It 's a very old language , ”
49410	49421	49404	49404	he	60	“ So old that no one living can read it . ”
49422	49428	49429	49429	she	61	“ No one but you , ”
49440	49485	49434	49434	he	60	" The people I learned it from stole me away into slavery when I was only a boy . Now they 're all dead . Their descendants have forgotten the old wisdom , the old writing , the old gods . Only I remember . ”
49684	49687	49688	49688	She	61	“ Anyanwu ? ”
49820	49828	49829	49829	she	61	“ Why did n't you tell me ! "
49832	49835	49829	49829	she	61	“ What ? ”
49841	49846	49836	49836	He	60	“ Tell you what ? ”
49847	49857	49858	49858	He	60	“ That these people were feeding me animal milk ! "
49873	49892	49863	49863	She	61	“ Is it a joke then ? Are the others laughing too now that I can not hear ? ”
49893	49896	49897	49897	He	60	“ Anyanwu ... "
49904	49909	49910	49910	he	60	“ I 'm sorry , ”
49914	49939	49910	49910	he	60	“ I was thinking of something else or I would n't have laughed . But , Anyanwu , we all ate the same food . ”
49940	49950	49863	49863	She	61	“ But why was some of it cooked with — ”
49951	50005	50006	50006	She	61	“ Listen . I know the custom among your people not to drink animal milk . I should have warned you — would have , if I had been thinking . No one else who ate with us knew the milk would offend you . I assure you , they 're not laughing . ”
50030	50041	50006	50006	She	61	“ These people cook with animal milk all the time ? ”
50042	50047	50048	50048	Doro	60	" All the time , ”
50051	50070	50048	50048	Doro	60	“ And they drink milk . It 's their custom . They keep some cattle especially for milking . ”
50074	50077	50078	50078	Anyanwu	61	“ Abomination ! ”
50083	50088	50089	50089	Doro	60	" Not to them , "
50093	50108	50089	50089	Doro	60	" And you will not insult them by telling them they are committing abomination . ”
50137	50147	50148	50148	he	60	“ You can become an animal whenever you wish , ”
50151	50162	50148	50148	he	60	“ You know there 's nothing evil about animal milk . ”
50163	50169	50170	50170	she	61	" It is for animals ! ”
50173	50191	50170	50170	she	61	“ I am not an animal now ! I did not just eat a meal with animals ! "
50195	50221	50192	50192	He	60	“ You know you must change to suit the customs here . You have not lived three hundred years without learning to accept new customs . ”
50222	50231	50282	50282	him	60	" I will not have any more milk ! ”
50232	50245	50246	50246	She	61	“ You need not . But let others have theirs in peace . ”
50267	50270	50252	50252	She	61	“ Anyanwu ! ”
50271	50276	50277	50277	she	61	" I will obey , ”
50285	50299	50277	50277	she	61	“ When will I have my own house ? My own cooking fire ? ”
50300	50356	50357	50357	His	60	“ When you 've learned what to do with them . What kind of meal could you cook now with foods you 've never seen before ? Sarah Cutler will teach you what you need to know . Tell her milk makes you sick and she 'll leave it out of what she teaches you . ”
50373	50384	50364	50364	he	60	“ It did make you sick , did n't it ? ”
50385	50395	50357	50357	His	60	" It did . Even my flesh knows abomination . "
50396	50405	50406	50406	She	61	" It did n't make anyone else sick . ”
50436	50442	50443	50443	he	60	" Have you healed yourself ? ”
50446	50469	50443	50443	he	60	“ Yes . But with so much food , it took me a long time to learn what was making me sick . ”
50470	50477	50357	50357	His	60	“ Do you have to know ? ”
50478	50521	50555	50555	Her	61	“ Of course . How can I know what to do for healing until I know what healing is needed and why ? I think I knew all the diseases and poisons of my people . I must learn the ones here . "
50522	50531	50443	50443	he	60	“ Does it hurt you — the learning ? ”
50532	50551	50357	50357	His	60	“ Oh yes . But only at first . Once I learn , it does not hurt again . ”
50560	50579	50555	50555	Her	61	" No , give me your hand again . You can touch me even though I am well . ”
50597	50602	50603	50603	she	61	“ That is good , ”
50606	50630	50603	50603	she	61	“ I healed myself just in time . Now lie down here and show me why all those women were looking at you . ”
50649	50655	50656	50656	he	60	“ We must talk tonight , ”
50669	50680	50681	50681	she	61	“ Do you still have strength for talking , husband ? ”
50685	50699	50681	50681	she	61	“ I thought you would go to sleep and not awaken until sunrise . ”
50700	50703	50709	50709	his	60	" No . "
50756	50767	50747	50747	she	61	“ You 've come to your new home , Anyanwu . ”
50768	50773	50782	50782	his	60	" I know that . ”
50811	50827	50789	50789	he	60	" You are home , but I will be leaving again in a few weeks . "
50828	50830	50789	50789	he	60	“ But ”
50831	50899	50900	50900	She	1475	“ I will be leaving . I have other people who need me to rid them of enemies or who need to see me to know they still belong to me . I have a fragmented people to hunt and reassemble . I have women in three different towns who could bear powerful children if I give them the right mates . And more . Much more . ”
50926	50932	50933	50933	she	1475	“ When you come back , ”
50937	50947	50933	50933	she	1475	“ there will be a son for you here . "
50948	50954	50978	50978	his	1476	“ Are you pregnant now ? ”
50955	50968	50978	50978	his	1476	" I can be now . Your seed still lives inside me . ”
50969	50972	50973	50973	She	1475	“ No ! ”
50981	50996	50997	50997	he	1476	“ This is not the body I want to beget your first children here , "
51011	51028	51003	51003	She	1475	“ All right . I 'll wait until you have . . . become another man . "
51029	51041	51003	51003	She	1475	“ You need not . I have another plan for you . "
51056	51060	51069	51069	he	1476	“ What plan ? ”
51061	51068	51069	51069	he	1476	" I want you to marry , ”
51072	51091	51069	51069	he	1476	“ You 'll do it in the way of the people here with a license and a wedding . ”
51092	51104	51069	51069	he	1476	" It makes no difference . I will follow your custom . "
51105	51113	51114	51114	She	1475	“ Yes . But not with me . ”
51139	51145	51146	51146	he	1476	“ You 'll marry Isaac , ”
51149	51204	51146	51146	he	1476	“ I want children from the two of you . And I want you to have a husband who does more than visit you now and then . Living here , you could go for a year , two years , without seeing me . I do n't want you to be that alone . ”
51205	51208	51209	51209	she	1475	" Isaac ? ”
51212	51216	51209	51209	she	1475	“ Your son ? ”
51217	51238	51146	51146	he	1476	“ My son . He 's a good man . He wants you , and I want you with him . ”
51239	51248	51146	51146	he	1476	" He 's a boy ! He 's ... "
51249	51271	51209	51209	she	1475	“ What man is not a boy to you , except me ? Isaac is more a man than you think . ”
51272	51302	51146	51146	he	1476	“ But . . . he 's your son ! How can I have the son when his father , my husband , still lives ? That is abomination ! ”
51303	51310	51146	51146	he	1476	“ Not if I command it . ”
51311	51320	51209	51209	she	1475	" You can not ! It is abomination ! "
51321	51361	51146	51146	he	1476	“ You have left your village , Anyanwu , and your town and your land and your people . You are here where I rule . Here , there is only one abomination : disobedience . You will obey . "
51362	51449	51450	51450	He	1478	“ I will not ! Wrong is wrong ! Some things change from place to place , but not this . If your people wish to debase themselves by drinking the milk of animals , I will turn my head . Their shame is their own . But now you want me to shame myself , make myself even worse than they . How can you ask it of me , Doro ? The land itself will be offended ! Your crops will wither and die ! ”
51457	51476	51450	51450	He	1478	“ That 's foolishness ! I thought I had found a woman too wise to believe such nonsense . ”
51477	51510	51450	51450	He	1478	“ You have found a woman who will not soil herself ! How is it here ? Do sons lie with their mothers also ? Do sisters and brothers lie down together ? ”
51511	51525	51450	51450	He	1478	“ Woman , if I command it , they lie down together gladly . "
51596	51606	51607	51607	Doro	60	" I want children of your body and his , ”
51625	51697	51610	51610	He	60	“ Sun woman , would I tell you to do something that would hurt my people ? The land is different here . It is my land ! Most of the people here exist because I caused their ancestors to marry in ways your people would not accept . Yet everyone lives well here . No angry god punishes them . Their crops grow and their harvests are rich every year . ”
51698	51726	51787	51787	she	1483	" And some of them hear so much of the thoughts of others that they can not think their own thoughts . Some of them hang themselves . ”
51727	51736	51787	51787	she	1483	“ Some of your own people hang themselves . ”
51737	51744	51610	51610	He	60	“ Not for such terrible reasons . "
51745	51777	51778	51778	She	1483	" Nevertheless , they die . Anyanwu , obey me . Life can be very good for you here . And you will not find a better husband than my son . ”
51895	51908	51909	51909	she	1483	“ You have been telling me lies from the day we met , ”
51921	51929	51913	51913	He	1484	" I have not lied to you . "
51930	51944	51913	51913	He	1484	“ ' Let me give you children who will live , you said . “
51985	51986	51978	51978	You	1484	” “
51998	52014	51987	51987	You	1484	” She cried out as though with pain , and climbed out of his bed . “
52020	52024	51987	51987	You	1484	” she hissed . “
52053	52066	52045	52045	I	0	” He lay still , as though he had not heard her . "
52072	52092	52045	52045	I	0	” he said after a while . She stared at him , her body shaking with fear and anger . “
52125	52180	52117	52117	I	0	" He said nothing . She stepped nearer to the bed , looked down into his expressionless face , pleading herself now . She did not think it was possible to move him by pleading once he had made up his mind , but so much was at stake . She had to try . "
52191	52195	52181	52181	I	0	” she said . “
52273	52397	52398	52398	Husband	2838	” She sighed and looked around the room , feeling as though she were hunting for the words that would reach him . There was only the alien furniture : the desk , the bed , the great wooden cabinet beside the door — a kas , it was called , a Dutch thing for storing clothing . There were two chairs and several mats — rugs of heavy , colorful cloth . It was all as alien as Doro himself . It gave her a feeling of hopelessness — as though she had come to this strange place only to die . She stared into the fire in the fireplace — the only familiar thing in the room — and spoke softly : “
52462	52478	52455	52455	I	0	” She turned her eyes back to him , saw that he was watching her . “
52496	52508	52509	52509	You	0	” He sat up , put his feet on the floor . “
52514	52531	52509	52509	You	0	" he said softly . He pulled her down to sit beside him on the bed . “
52585	52586	52580	52580	Isaac	84	" “
52593	52597	52591	52591	Lale	73	" 110 Wild Seed “
52633	52634	52617	52617	I	0	” “
52649	52650	52636	52636	you	0	" "
52653	52654	52655	52655	Isaac	84	” “
52681	52693	52670	52670	You	0	” He drew a deep breath , looked at her sadly . “
52725	52736	52723	52723	me	0	” She closed her mouth , swallowed a new protest . "
52744	52748	52737	52737	I	0	” he continued . "
52775	52836	52761	52761	I	0	” She looked away . No , of course she did not believe that . She had only hoped to reach him , make him stop his impossible demands . No , he was not casting her aside for any reason at all . He was merely breeding her as one bred cattle and goats . He had said it : “
52846	52869	52761	52761	I	0	” What she wanted meant nothing . Did one ask a cow or a nanny goat whether it wished to be bred ? "
52881	52886	52870	52870	I	0	” he told her . "
52912	52919	52906	52906	I	0	” She shook her head slowly . "
52929	52974	52922	52922	you	0	" She gazed at him — at his very ordinary eyes , at his long , handsome face . Until now , she had managed to avoid a confrontation like this by giving in a little , obeying . Now she could not obey . “
52980	52985	52975	52975	You	0	” she said quietly , “
53038	53039	53028	53028	you	0	” “
53045	53061	53028	53028	you	0	” His quiet calm matched her own , but in him it was clearly resignation . “
53085	53086	53087	53087	You	0	” "
53091	53121	53087	53087	You	0	” Within herself , she altered her reproductive organs further , made herself literally no longer a woman , but not quite a man — just to be certain . “
53134	53138	53141	53141	you	0	” she said . “
53212	53228	53229	53229	You	0	" She could not have missed the anger in his voice when he spoke again . “
53243	53296	53231	53231	I	0	" She turned her back on him , not wanting him to see her fear and pain , not wanting her own eyes to see him . He was a loathsome thing . He came to stand behind her , put his hands on her shoulders . She struck them away violently . “
53300	53304	53231	53231	I	0	” she hissed . “
53317	53318	53231	53231	I	0	" “
53323	53328	53231	53231	I	0	” he said unmoved . “
53340	53344	53329	53332	No child of mine	1528	” she whispered . “
53350	53354	53355	53355	You	0	” he said . “
53387	53463	53464	53464	You	0	” She said nothing . He was right , of course . Even her own strength was mere bravado , a façade covering utter terror . It was only her anger that kept her neck straight . And what good was anger or defiance ? He would consume her very spirit ; there would be no next life for her . Then he would use and pervert her children . She felt near to weeping . “
53471	53475	53464	53464	You	0	” he said . “
53500	53501	53502	53502	I	0	" "
53530	53546	53523	53523	I	0	” He sighed , tied his cloth around him , and started for the door . “
53550	53555	53523	53523	I	0	” he told her . “
53562	53563	53523	53523	I	0	” "
53567	53572	53523	53523	I	0	” she demanded bitterly . “
53576	53690	53574	53574	Isaac	84	” he answered . And when she turned to face him , mouth open to curse both him and his son , he stepped close to her and struck her across the face with all his strength . There was an instant before the blow landed when she could have caught his arm and broken the bones within it like dry sticks . There was an instant before the blow landed when she could have torn out his throat . 112 Wild Seed But she absorbed the blow , moved with it , made no sound . It had been a long time since she had wanted so powerfully to kill a man . “
53700	53704	53693	53693	you	1535	” he said . “
53739	53740	53743	53743	he	3223	” “
53753	53971	53743	53743	he	3223	” she demanded harshly . Doro paused at the door to give her a look of contempt . His blow had had less power to hurt her than that look . When the door closed behind him , she went to the bed and sat down to stare , unseeing , into the fire . By the time Isaac knocked on the door , her face was wet with tears she did not remember shedding . She made him wait until she had wrapped a cloth around herself and dried her face . Then with leaden , hopeless weariness , she opened the door and let the boy in . He looked as depleted as she felt . The yellow hair hung limp into his eyes and the eyes themselves were red . His sun - browned skin looked as pale as Anyanwu had ever seen it . He seemed not only tired , but sick . He stood gazing at her , saying nothing , making her want to go to him as though to Okoye , and try to give him comfort . Instead , she sat down in one of the room 's chairs so that he could not sit close to her ... Obligingly , he sat opposite her in the other chair . “
53977	53982	53973	53973	he	1537	” he asked softly . “
53995	53996	53989	53989	he	1537	" "
54007	54008	53989	53989	he	1537	” “

54026	54027	54028	54028	I	0	” “
54037	54051	54028	54028	I	0	” There was a long , uncomfortable silence . Finally , Isaac whispered , "
54068	54069	54071	54071	you	1537	” “
54078	54082	54071	54071	you	1537	” she said . “

54163	54167	54168	54168	You	61	” he cried . “
54174	54205	54168	54168	You	61	" She turned her face away from him . If only he would go away . She did not want to say things to hurt him . He spoke softly : “
54287	54288	54277	54277	You	61	” “
54303	54304	54277	54277	You	61	” "

54325	54331	54322	54322	I	0	” She glanced at him . “
54337	54338	54322	54322	I	0	" "
54347	54351	54345	54345	It	1546	" He shrugged . “
54440	54461	54462	54462	Doro	60	” He got up , went to stand beside the fireplace . The low flame seemed to comfort him too . “
54471	54475	54462	54462	Doro	60	" he said . “
54496	54539	54540	54542	My first woman	1555	" He hesitated , glanced at her as though to see how she was receiving such talk , whether she was offended . She was almost indifferent . She had made up her mind . Nothing the boy said would change it . “
54544	54548	54540	54542	My first woman	1555	” he continued , “
54582	54583	54575	54575	they	1557	” “
54589	54594	54575	54575	they	1557	” Anyanwu said quietly . “
54598	54605	54595	54595	I	0	” he said matching her tone . “
54627	54637	54613	54613	I	0	” She wanted to run out of the room . “
54644	54651	54642	54642	Isaac	84	” He shook his head slowly . “
54673	54678	54667	54667	me	0	” She said nothing . “
54691	54697	54681	54681	I	0	” He frowned at her . “

54790	54794	54795	54795	Lale	73	" Isaac said . “

54859	54863	54853	54853	I	0	” she said . “
54896	54915	54886	54886	I	0	” He turned from the fire , went back to his chair and pulled it close to her . “
54947	54948	54937	54937	you	0	” “
54955	54961	54951	54951	I	0	” she said in disgust . “

54993	55008	55009	55009	He	0	" She could not help hearing the anger in his voice . She sighed . “
55014	55015	55009	55009	He	0	” “
55019	55023	55009	55009	He	0	" muttered Isaac . "

55159	55164	55165	55165	You	61	” she said wearily . "
55166	55174	55184	55184	I	0	mean”—she hunted through her memory for the right word—“you

55563	55601	55602	55602	I	0	" There was a long period of silence . Only the log in the fireplace slipped , then spat and crackled as new wood began to burn . Anyanwu covered her face , shook her head slowly . “
55612	55616	55606	55606	you	0	” she whispered . “
55632	55637	55626	55626	you	0	” He said nothing . “

55663	55667	55690	55690	Doro	60	” Isaac said . “

55702	55706	55690	55690	Doro	60	” Isaac frowned . “

55779	55780	55754	55754	He	60	” “
55783	55790	55754	55754	He	60	” Anyanwu took a deep breath . "
55811	55815	55802	55802	he	497	” 116 Wild Seed "
55837	55878	55826	55826	you	1603	” Submit to him . The words brought a vile taste to her mouth , but she looked at Isaac 's haggard face , and his obvious misery and his fear for her calmed her somehow . She spoke softly . “
55898	55899	55889	55889	you	1603	” “
55905	55906	55889	55889	you	1603	” “

55971	55978	55960	55960	he	497	” Isaac repeated with gentle irony . “
55991	56028	55960	55960	he	497	” She turned away . Another time she might have been amused to hear Isaac counseling patience . He was not a patient young man . But now , for her sake , he was desperate . “
56036	56040	56034	56034	Anyanwu	61	” he said , “
56120	56126	56131	56131	Anyanwu	61	” Isaac paused for breath . “
56160	56319	56320	56320	I	0	" She shook her head . She knew now how the slaves had felt as they lay chained on the bench , the slaver 's hot iron burning into their flesh . In her pride , she had denied that she was a slave . She could no longer deny it . Doro 's mark had been on her from the day they met . She could break free of him only by dying and sacrificing her children and leaving him loose upon the world to become even more of an animal . So much of what Isaac said seemed to be right . Or was it her cowardice , her fear of Doro 's terrible way of killing that made his words seem so reasonable ? How could she know ? Whatever she did would result in evil . Isaac got up , came to her , took her hands , and drew her to her feet . “
56338	56342	56328	56328	I	0	" he said . “
56353	56392	56403	56403	he	60	" Wearily , hopelessly , she allowed him to draw her closer . Had she been an ordinary woman , he would have crushed the breath from Wild Seed 117 her . After a moment , she said , "

56440	56444	56435	56435	I	0	” he whispered . “
56459	56460	56449	56449	you	0	" "
56475	56483	56470	56470	I	0	” He stared at her in alarm . “
56490	56495	56496	56496	I	0	" she said reassuringly . "
56527	56528	56529	56529	You	0	” "
56541	56545	56529	56529	You	0	” he said . “
56563	56564	56546	56549	The rest of you	1622	" "
56567	56568	56546	56549	The rest of you	1622	" "
56571	56579	56580	56580	I	0	" She rested her head against him . “
56597	56610	56584	56584	I	0	” She looked up at his young face , his boy face . “
56649	57055	57056	57056	Pelham	118	” He lifted her with the strength of his arms alone and carried her to the great soft bed , there to make the children who would prolong her slavery . Book II Lot 's Children 1741 CHAPTER 7 Doro had come to Wheatley to see to the welfare of one of his daughters . He had a feeling something was wrong with her , and as usual , he allowed such feelings to guide him . As he rode into town from the landing , he could hear a loud dispute in progress - something about one man 's cow ruining another 's garden . Doro approached the disputants slowly , watching them . They stood before Isaac , who sat on a bench in front of the house he and Anyanwu had built over fifty years before . Isaac , slender and youthful - looking in spite of his age and his thick gray hair , had no official authority to settle disputes . He had been a farmer , then a merchantnever a magistrate . But even when he was younger , people brought their disagreements to him . He was one of Doro 's favorite sons . That made him powerful and influential . Also , he was known for his honesty and fairness . People liked him as they could not quite like Doro . They could worship Doro as a god , they could give him their love , their fear , their respect , but most found him too intimidating to like . One of the reasons Doro came back to a son like Isaac , old and past most of his usefulness , was that Isaac was a friend as well as a son . Isaac was one of the few people who could enjoy Doro 's company without fear or falseness . And Isaac was an old man , soon to die . They all died so quickly . ... Doro reached the house and sat slouched for a moment on his black mare - a handsome animal who had come with his latest lessthan - handsome body . The two men arguing over the cow had calmed down by now . Isaac had a way of calming unreasonable people . Another man could say and do exactly what Isaac said and did and be knocked down for his trouble . But people listened to Isaac . “
57058	57088	57089	57089	Pelham	118	” Isaac was saying to the older of the two men — a gaunt , large - boned farmer whom Doro remembered as poor breeding stock . 122 Wild Seed “
57108	57109	57099	57099	I	0	” “
57116	57120	57099	57099	I	0	” Pelham answered . “
57131	57227	57099	57099	I	0	” Pelham 's son , Doro recalled , had just about enough sense not to wet himself . He was a huge , powerful man with the mind of a child -a timid , gentle child , fortunately . Doro was glad to hear that he could handle something . Isaac looked up , noticed for the first time the small sharp - featured stranger Doro was just then , and did what he had always done . With none of the talents of his brother Lale to warn him , Isaac inevitably recognized Doro . “
57230	57234	57099	57099	I	0	" he said , “
57245	57255	57239	57239	you	1630	” Then he turned toward the house and called , "
57262	57291	57256	57256	Peter	119	" He stood up spryly and took the reins of Doro 's horse , handing them to his son Peter as the boy came out of the house . "
57309	57313	57294	57294	I	0	” Doro said . “
57322	57326	57294	57294	I	0	” Isaac laughed . "
57345	57375	57339	57339	you	0	” Now that Doro had spoken , Pelham and the other man recognized him and spoke together in a confused babble of welcome . Doro held up his hand . “
57384	57546	57376	57376	I	0	” he said . The welcomes subsided . The two men shook his hand , wished him a good evening , and hurried off to spread the news of his return . In his few words , he had told him that his visit was unofficial . He had not come to take a new body , and thus would not hold court to settle serious grievances or offer needed financial or other aid in the way that had become customary in Wheatley and some of his other settlements . This visit , he was only a man come to see his children , of whom there were forty - two here , ranging from infants to Isaac . It was rare for him to come to town for no other purpose than to see them , but when he did , other people left him alone . If anyone was in desperate need , they approached one of his children . “
57551	57555	57376	57376	I	0	” Isaac said . "
57563	57604	57376	57376	I	0	” He did not have an old man 's voice , high and cracking . His voice had become deeper and fuller - it contributed to his authority . But all Doro could hear in it now was honest pleasure . "
57609	57613	57376	57376	I	0	” Doro said . “
57618	57619	57616	57616	Anyanwu	61	” “
57650	57658	57644	57644	Anyanwu	61	” Isaac poured two tankards of beer . "
57667	57668	57669	57669	Anyanwu	61	” “
57707	57711	57682	57682	they	1636	" Isaac paused . “
57739	58017	58018	58018	Isaac	84	” Doro frowned , took a swallow of beer . The Sloanes were his newest wild seed — a couple who had found each other before Doro found them . They were dangerous , unstable , painfully sensitive people who heard the thoughts of others in intermittent bursts . When one received a burst of pain , anger , fear , any intense emotion , it was immediately transmitted to the other , and both suffered . None of this was deliberate or controlled . It simply happened . Helplessly , the Sloanes did a great deal of fighting and drinking and crying and praying for it to stop happening , but it would not . Not ever . That was why Doro had brought them to Wheatley . They were amazingly good breeding stock to be wild seed . He suspected that in one way or another , they were each descended from his people . Certainly , they were enough like his people to make excellent prey . And as soon as they had produced a few more children , Doro intended to take them both . It would be almost a kindness . But for now , they would go on being abysmal parents , neglecting and abusing their children not out of cruelty , but because they hurt too badly themselves to notice their children 's pain . In fact , they were likely to notice that pain only as a new addition to their own . Thus , sometimes their kind murdered children . Doro had not believed the Sloanes were dangerous in that way . Now , he was less certain . “
58021	58032	58018	58018	Isaac	84	" Isaac looked at him , understood the unspoken question . “
58046	58047	58035	58035	you	84	" “
58050	58051	58035	58035	you	84	" “
58080	58081	58071	58071	Anyanwu	61	" “
58097	58101	58071	58071	Anyanwu	61	” 124 Wild Seed “
58127	58128	58114	58114	I	0	” “
58133	58134	58135	58135	They	1640	” “
58168	58169	58148	58148	they	1640	" “
58172	58177	58178	58178	They	1640	" Isaac looked away . “
58203	58281	58192	58192	I	0	” Doro smiled thinly . Isaac refused to lie to the people he thought Doro had selected as prey . Most often , he refused to tell them anything at all . Sometimes such people guessed what was being kept from them , and they ran . Doro took pleasure in hunting them down . Lann Sloane , Doro thought , would be especially good game . The man had a kind of animal wariness about him . “
58293	58465	58288	58288	your	84	” Isaac commented . Doro shrugged . He knew what Anyanwu would say , and that she meant it when she compared him to one kind of animal or another . Once she had said such things out of fear or anger . Now she said them out of grim hatred . She had made herself the nearest thing he had to an enemy . She obeyed . She was civil . But she could hold a grudge as no one Doro had ever known . She was alive because of Isaac . Doro had no doubt that if he had tried to give her to any of his other sons , she would have refused and died . He had asked her what Isaac said to change her mind , and when she refused to tell him , he had asked Isaac . To his surprise , Isaac refused to tell him , too . His son refused him very little , angered him very rarely . But this time ... “
58473	58478	58466	58466	You	1647	” Isaac had said . "
58491	58939	58480	58480	she	1648	” His face and his voice told Doro he would not say any more . Doro had left Wheatley the next day , confident that Isaac would take care of the details — marry the woman , build himself a house , help her learn to live in the settlement , decide on work for himself , start the children coming . Even at twenty - five , Isaac had been very capable . And Doro had not trusted himself to stay near either Isaac or Anyanwu . The depth of his own anger amazed him . Normally , people had only to annoy him to die for their error . He had to think to remember how long it had been since he had felt real anger and left those who caused it alive . But his son Wild Seed 125 and this tiresome little forest peasant who was , fortunately for her , the best wild seed he had ever found , had lived . There was no forgiveness in Anyanwu , though . If she had learned to love her husband , she had not learned to forgive her husband 's father . Now and then , Doro tried to penetrate her polite , aloof hostility , tried to break her , bring her back to what she was when he took her from her people . He was not accustomed to people resisting him , not accustomed to their hating him . The woman was a puzzle he had not yet solved — which was why now , after she had given him eight children , given Isaac five children , she was still alive . She would come to him again , without the coldness . She would make herself young without being told to do so , and she would come to him . Then , satisfied , he would kill her . He licked his lips thinking about it , and Isaac coughed . Doro looked at his son with the old fondness and amended his thought . Anyanwu would live until Isaac died . She was keeping Isaac healthy , perhaps keeping him alive . She was doing it for herself , of course . Isaac had captured her long ago as he captured everyone , and she did not want to lose him any sooner than she had to . But her reasons did not matter . Inadvertently , she was doing Doro a service . He did not want to lose Isaac any sooner than he had to either . He shook his head , spoke to divert himself from the thought of his son 's dying . "
58949	58953	58940	58940	I	0	” he said . “
58975	59025	58973	58973	Nweke	123	” This was Anyanwu 's youngest daughter . Doro claimed her as his daughter too , though Anyanwu disputed this . Doro had worn the body that fathered the girl , but he had not worn it at the time of the fathering . He had taken it afterward . “
59031	59035	59026	59026	Nweke	123	” Isaac said . “
59069	59070	59060	59060	Anyanwu	61	” "
59086	59093	59071	59071	You	0	” Isaac thought for a moment . “
59132	59136	59124	59127	the Van Ness girl	1652	” Doro nodded . “
59212	59213	59215	59215	I	0	” “
59225	59226	59220	59220	you	0	” “
59234	59261	59227	59227	You	0	” Isaac said , smiling . He looked away , remembered pleasure flickering across his face , causing him to look years younger than he was . “
59292	59293	59294	59294	I	0	” "
59323	59324	59312	59312	Firearms	124	” "
59331	59336	59328	59328	I	0	" Isaac said quietly . “
59350	59354	59337	59337	You	0	" Doro sighed . “
59360	59361	59337	59337	You	0	” “
59378	59489	59372	59372	she	61	” Anyanwu the protector , Doro thought with bitterness that surprised him . Anyanwu the defender of anyone who needed her . Doro wondered what she would do if he told her he needed her . Laugh ? Very likely . She would be right , of course . Over the years it had become almost as difficult for him to get a lie past her as it was for her to lie successfully to him . The only reason she did not know of his colony of her African descendants in South Carolina was that he had never given her reason to ask . Even Isaac did not know . “
59495	59500	59502	59502	her	1657	” he asked Isaac . “
59508	59509	59502	59502	her	1657	” "
59516	59520	59521	59521	I	0	” Isaac said . “
59602	59603	59596	59596	she	1657	" “
59609	59613	59605	59605	she	1657	” Isaac hesitated . “
59626	59631	59623	59623	I	0	" he said finally . "
59671	59839	59666	59666	she	1657	” Doro looked up at the portrait of Anyanwu on the wall opposite the high , shallow fireplace . The style of the house was English here , Dutch there , Igbo somewhere else . Anyanwu had made earthen pots , Wild Seed 127 variations of those she had once sold in the marketplaces of her homeland , and stout handsome baskets . People bought them from her and placed them around their houses as she had . Her work was both decorative and utilitarian , and here in her house with its Dutch fireplace and kas , its English settle and thronelike wainscot chairs , it evoked memories of a land she would not see again . Anyanwu had never sanded the floor as Dutch women did . Dirt was for sweeping out , she said contemptuously , not for scattering on the floor . She was more house proud than most English women Doro knew , but Dutch women shook their heads and gossiped about her “
59841	60110	60111	60112	black savages	1658	” housekeeping and pretended to pity Isaac . In fact , in the easy atmosphere of Wheatley , nearly every woman pitied Isaac so much that had he wished , he could have spread his valuable seed everywhere . Only Doro drew female attention more strongly — and only Doro took advantage of it . But then , Doro did not have to worry about outraged husbands — or an outraged wife . The portrait of Anyanwu was extraordinary . Clearly , the Dutch artist had been captured by her beauty . He had draped her in a brilliant blue that set off her dark skin beautifully as blue always had . Even her hair had been hidden in blue cloth . She was holding a child — her first son by Isaac . The child too , only a few months old , was partly covered by the blue . He looked out of the painting , largeeyed and handsomer than any infant should have been . Did Anyanwu deliberately conceive only handsome children ? Every one of them was beautiful , even though Doro had fathered some with hideous bodies . The portrait was a black madonna and child right down to Anyanwu 's too - clear , innocent - seeming eyes . Strangers were moved to comment on the likeness . Some were appreciative , looking at the still handsome Anyanwu — she kept herself looking well for Isaac even as she aged herself along with him . Others were deeply offended , believing that someone actually had tried to portray the Virgin and Child as “
60114	60305	60111	60112	black savages	1658	” Race prejudice was growing in the colonies — even in this formerly Dutch colony where things had once been so casual . Earlier in the year , there had been mass executions at New York City . Someone had been setting fires and the whites decided it must be the blacks . On little or no evidence , thirtyone blacks were killed - thirteen of them burned at the stake . Doro was beginning to worry about this upriver town . Of all his English colonial settlements , only in this one did his blacks not have the 128 Wild Seed protection of powerful white owners . How soon before whites from elsewhere began to see them as fair game . Doro shook his head . The woman in the portrait seemed to look down at him as he looked up . He should have had too much on his mind to think about her or about her daughter Ruth , called Nweke . He should not have allowed himself to be drawn back to Wheatley . It was good to see Isaac . . . but that woman ! “
60316	60321	60306	60306	She	1659	” Isaac was saying . “
60351	60352	60346	60346	her	1659	" "
60359	60364	60353	60353	I	0	” Doro said abruptly . “
60387	60388	60372	60372	I	0	" “
60400	60407	60394	60394	you	0	” Doro did not like the word “
60410	60421	60422	60422	Nweke	123	” but he nodded without comment . Isaac stood up . “
60435	60469	60470	60470	I	0	” He went out of the house without waiting for Doro to answer . He loved Doro and he loved Anyanwu and it bothered him that the two got along so badly together . “
60484	60495	60475	60475	you	0	” he told Doro once - to Doro 's surprise . “
60535	60536	60529	60529	you	0	” "
60543	60549	60537	60537	I	0	” Doro had told him . “
60579	60677	60557	60557	You	0	” He had not touched her children because from the first , she promised him that if any one of them was harmed , she would bear no more . No matter what he did to her , she would bear no more . Her sincerity was unmistakable ; thus he refrained from preying on her least successful children , refrained from breeding her daughters to her sons or bedding those daughters himself . She did not know what care he had taken to keep her content . She did not know , but Isaac should have . “
60695	60700	60678	60678	You	1670	” Isaac had said . “
60707	60708	60702	60702	you	1670	” “
60729	60747	60725	60725	her	1671	” Isaac had looked at him steadily , almost angrily , for several secWild Seed 129 onds . “
60755	61004	60748	60748	I	0	" he had said . He had said it without fear . Over the years , he had come to learn that he was one of the few people who did not have to be afraid . Doro had gone away from him feeling ashamed . He had not thought it was still possible for him to feel shame , but Anyanwu 's presence seemed to be slowly awakening several long dormant emotions in him . How many women had he sent Isaac to without feeling a thing . Isaac had done as he was told and come home . Home from Pennsylvania , home from Maryland , home from Georgia , home from Spanish Florida . . . Isaac did n't mind either . He did n't like being away from Anyanwu and the children for long periods , but he did n't mind the women . And they certainly did n't mind him . He did n't mind that Doro had begotten eight of Anyanwu 's children . Or seven . Only Anyanwu minded that . Only she felt humiliated . But Nweke 's father was , perhaps , another matter . The girl , eighteen years old , small and dark like her mother , came through the door , Isaac 's arm around her shoulders . She was redėyed as though she had been crying or as though she had n't been sleeping . Probably both . This was a bad time for her . "
61009	61020	61007	61007	you	1673	” she whispered , seeing the sharp - featured stranger . “
61024	61069	61007	61007	you	1673	” Doro said , smiling . His voice , the knowledge that he was indeed Doro , triggered tears . She went to him crying softly , looking for comfort in his arms . He held her and looked over her shoulder at Isaac . “
61083	61087	61071	61071	you	1673	” Isaac said . “
61107	61304	61102	61102	I	0	” Doro said nothing , motioned Isaac back out the door . Isaac obeyed silently , probably feeling more guilt than he should have . This was no ordinary girl . None of her brothers or sisters had reached Doro miles away with their desperation as their transitions neared . What had he felt about her ? Anxiety , worry , more . Some indefinable feeling not only that she was near transition , but that she was on the verge of becoming something he had not known before . Something new . It was as though from New York City he had sensed another Anyanwu - new , different , attracting him , pulling him . He had never followed a feeling more willingly . The girl moved in his arms and he took her to the high - backed settle near the fireplace . The narrow bench was nearly as uncomIs it youmably both . Theen cryin 130 Wild Seed fortable as the wainscot chairs . Not for the first time , Doro wondered why Isaac and Anyanwu did not buy or have made some comfortable modern furniture . Surely they could afford it . “
61312	61337	61307	61307	I	0	” the girl whispered . She had put her head against his shoulder , but even that close , Doro could hardly hear her . “
61343	61344	61307	61307	I	0	” “
61348	61353	61307	61307	I	0	” he said simply . "
61358	61359	61307	61307	I	0	” "
61362	61377	61307	61307	I	0	” From a whisper to almost a scream . Then back to the whisper . “
61380	61381	61307	61307	I	0	” “
61384	61420	61307	61307	I	0	” He held her away from him a little so that he could see the small face , swollen and weary . The girl 's coloring was gray rather than its usual rich dark brown . “
61427	61428	61421	61421	You	0	” "
61448	61449	61450	61450	You	0	” “
61456	61466	61450	61450	You	0	" She shrank against the back of the bench . “
61476	61541	61469	61470	David Whitten	126	” Doro nodded . The Whitten boy was twenty . Fairly good breeding stock . His family would be worth more in generations to come . They had a sensitivity that puzzled Doro . He did not know quite what they were becoming , but the feeling he got from them was good . They were a pleasant mystery that careful inbreeding would solve . “
61546	61550	61551	61551	David	126	” Nweke said , “
61561	61568	61570	61570	he	126	” Startled , Doro laughed aloud . “
61572	61573	61570	61570	he	126	" "
61597	61598	61594	61594	They	1677	" “
61605	61612	61594	61594	They	1677	” She looked at him closely . “
61619	61620	61614	61614	you	1680	” "
61623	61629	61614	61614	you	1680	" Doro was still smiling . "
61639	61640	61633	61634	the girl	3260	” “
61643	61647	61648	61648	She	3260	” Nweke hesitated . “
61652	61653	61648	61648	She	3260	” “
61658	61680	61656	61656	you	1680	” Doro observed . Nweke twisted away , embarrassed . There was no coyness to her ; her embarrassment was real . “
61697	61698	61700	61700	you	1680	” “
61711	61719	61709	61709	Me	0	” She blinked , licked her lips . “

61784	61788	61778	61778	They	1683	” Nweke said . “
61874	61890	61891	61891	They	1684	” Her hands were clinched tight around each other , her eyes wide with remembering . "
61921	61927	61929	61929	God	76	" She stopped , choked . “
61931	61932	61929	61929	God	76	” “
61941	61945	61933	61933	You	0	” Doro asked . “
61954	61982	61933	61933	You	0	” She was crying silently , not sobbing , only staring straight ahead as tears ran down her face and her nails dug themselves into her palms . “
61996	62000	61983	61983	I	0	” she whispered . “
62008	62012	61983	61983	I	0	” Doro said . “
62025	62062	61983	61983	I	0	” Doro took her hands and unclinched the long , slender fingers . There were bloody marks on her palms where the nails had punctured . Doro ran a finger across the hard neatly cut nails . “
62066	62070	61983	61983	I	0	" he said , “
62084	62085	62086	62086	You	0	” “
62091	62092	62086	62086	You	0	” “
62131	62132	62125	62125	I	0	” “
62166	62172	62158	62159	Oh God	76	" She began sobbing now . “
62201	62202	62174	62174	someone	185	” “
62212	62216	62174	62174	someone	185	” Doro said , “
62222	62223	62217	62217	you	0	” “
62235	62239	62232	62232	You	0	” He grinned . “
62243	62248	62232	62232	You	0	” Then he sobered . “
62283	62290	62291	62291	I	0	” She looked at him timidly . "
62299	62322	62291	62291	I	0	" 132 Wild Seed Only the youngest of his children said such things . He pushed her head back to his shoulder . “
62325	62329	62291	62291	I	0	” he said , “
62358	62386	62353	62353	you	0	” She understood and said nothing . Like most of his people , she did not try to move away from him when he warned or threatened . “
62392	62396	62397	62397	I	0	" she asked . "
62474	62475	62476	62476	You	3235	” “
62481	62487	62476	62476	You	3235	” she said against him . “
62498	62499	62488	62488	I	0	” "
62503	62508	62488	62488	I	0	” he said harshly . "
62543	62713	62539	62539	herself	104	" Anneke Strycker Croon . She was the one who should have been having this talk with Nweke . She had been his best mind reader in a half - dozen generations - beautifully controlled . Once her transition was ended , she never entered another person 's mind unless she wanted to . Her only flaw was that she was barren . Anyanwu tried to help her . Doro brought her one male body after another , all in vain . Thus , finally , Anneke had half adopted Nweke . The young girl and the old woman had found a similarity in each other that pleased Doro . It was rare for someone with Anneke 's ability to take any pleasure at all in children . Doro saw the friendship as a good omen for Nweke 's immature talents . But now , Anneke was three years dead , and Nweke was alone . No doubt her next words came at least partially out of her loneliness . “
62719	62723	62715	62715	you	1708	” she asked . “
62728	62745	62715	62715	you	1708	” Doro asked , knowing very well that she did not mean everyone all his people . “
62753	62761	62762	62764	The different ones	1710	” she said not looking at him . “
62766	62767	62762	62764	The different ones	1710	” “
62781	62792	62793	62793	You	1708	” She seemed to force herself to meet his eyes . “
62816	62820	62812	62812	you	1708	” Wild Seed 133 "
62828	62839	62812	62812	you	1708	” He took a deep breath and stilled his amusement . “
62845	62846	62812	62812	you	1708	” “
62853	62854	62847	62847	You	1708	” “
62857	62865	62869	62869	you	1708	” He felt her start against him . “
62871	62872	62873	62873	Me	0	" “
62875	62882	62884	62884	you	1708	” she whispered timidly , finally . “
62888	63323	62884	62884	you	1708	” The favorite question of his daughters - only his daughters . His sons hoped he loved them , but they did not ask . Perhaps they did not dare to . Ah , but this girl ... When she was healthy , her eyes were like her mother 's clear whites and browns , baby 's eyes . She had finer bones than Anyanwu — slenderer wrists and ankles , more prominent cheekbones . She was the daughter of one of Isaac 's older sons — a son he had had by a wild - seed Indian woman who read thoughts and saw into distant closed places . The Indians were rich in untapped wild seed that they tended to tolerate or even revere rather than destroy . Eventually , they would learn to be civilized and to understand as the whites understood that the hearing of voices , the seeing of visions , the moving of inanimate objects when no hand touched them , all the strange feelings , sensitivities , and abilities were evil or dangerous , or at the very least , imaginary . Then they too would weed out or grind down their different ones , thus freezing themselves in time , depriving their kind of any senses but those already familiar , depriving their children and their children 's children of any weapons with which to confront Doro 's people . And surely , in some future time , the day of confrontation would come . This girl , as rare and valuable for her father 's blood as for her mother 's , might well live to see that day . If ever he was to breed a long - lived descendant from Anyanwu , it would be this girl . He felt utterly certain of her . Over the years , he had taught himself not to assume that any new breed would be successful until transition ended and he saw the success before him . But the feelings that came to him from this girl were too powerful to doubt . He had no more certain urge than the urge that directed him toward the very best prey . Now it spoke to him as it had never spoken before , even for Isaac or Anyanwu . The girl 's talent teased and enticed him . He would not kill her , of course . He did not kill the best of his children . But he would have what he could of her now . And she would have what she wanted of him . "
63331	63337	63324	63324	I	0	” he said , smiling . “
63371	63403	63359	63359	I	0	” 134 Wild Seed That was apparently enough for her . She caught him in a joyful stranglehold and kissed him not at all as a daughter should kiss her father . “
63409	63414	63404	63404	I	0	” she said shyly . “
63454	63464	63439	63439	I	0	” And she echoed her stepfather — her grandfather . “
63474	63493	63439	63439	I	0	” Her voice had taken on a fierceness , as though Doro owed her what she was demanding . “
63498	63506	63439	63439	I	0	” he said , playing with her . "
63524	63541	63542	63542	You	0	” She clutched at his arms , her hard little nails now digging into his flesh . “
63547	63551	63542	63542	You	0	” she hissed . “
63562	63750	63751	63751	Doro	60	” To his disgust , Doro found himself thinking about Anyanwu . He had always resisted the advances of her daughters before . It had become a habit . Nweke was the last child Doro had coerced Anyanwu into bearing , but Doro had gone on respecting Anyanwu 's superstitions — not that Anyanwu appreciated the kindness . Well , Anyanwu was about to lose her place with him to this young daughter . Whatever he had been reaching for , trying to bribe from the mother , the daughter would supply . The daughter was not wild seed with years of freedom to make her stubborn . The daughter had been his from the moment of her conception — his property as surely as though his brand were burned into her flesh . She even thought of herself as his property . His children , young and old , male and female , most often made the matter of ownership very simple for him . They accepted his authority and seemed to need his assurance that strange as they were , they still belonged to someone . “
63753	64186	63751	63751	Doro	60	” the girl said softly . She had a red kerchief tied over her hair . He pushed it back to reveal her thick dark hair , straighter than her mother 's but not as straight as her father 's . She had combed it back and pinned it in a large knot . Only a single heavy curl hung free to her smooth brown shoulder . He resisted the impulse to remove the pins , let the other curls free . He and the girl would not have much time together . He did not want her wasting what they had pinning up her hair . Nor did he want her appearance to announce at once to Anyanwu what had happened . Anyanwu would find out - probably very quickly — but she would not find out through any apparent brazenness on the part Wild Seed 135 of her daughter . She would find out in such a way as to cause her to blame Doro . Her daughter still needed her too badly to alienate her . No one in any of Doro 's settlements was as good at helping people through transition as Anyanwu . Her body could absorb the physical punishment of restraining a violent , usually very strong young person . She did not hurt her charges or allow them to hurt themselves . They did not frighten or disgust her . She was their companion , their sister , their mother , their lover through their agony . If they could survive their own mental upheaval , they would come through to find that she had taken good care of their physical bodies . Nweke would need that looking after — whatever she needed right now . He lifted the girl , carried her to an alcove bed in one of the children 's bedrooms . He did not know whether it was her bed , did not care . He undressed her , brushing away her hands when she tried to help , laughing softly when she commented that he seemed to know pretty well how to get a woman out of her clothes . She did not know much about undressing a man , but she fumbled and tried to help him . And she was as lovely as he had expected . A virgin of course . Even in Wheatley , young girls usually saved themselves for husbands , or for Doro . She was ready for him . She had some pain , but it did n't seem to matter to her . “
64194	64257	63751	63751	Doro	60	” she whispered once , and held onto him as though fearing he might leave her . ressed and he bed had and drinking Nweke and Doro were in the kitchen popping corn and drinking beer when Isaac and Anyanwu came in . The bed had been remade and Nweke had been properly dressed and cautioned against even the appearance of brazenness . “
64265	64270	64259	64259	her	1717	” Doro had said , “
64278	64279	64280	64280	I	0	" “
64291	64295	64280	64280	I	0	” Nweke said . “
64322	64323	64325	64325	she	1717	” “
64327	64328	64325	64325	she	1717	” “
64332	64339	64342	64342	she	1717	” She glanced at him uncertainly . "
64356	64360	64342	64342	she	1717	” Nweke shuddered . “
64369	64406	64363	64363	she	1717	” Doro did not know , and he did not intend to leave until he found out . Until he could see that any anger Anyanwu felt would do her daughter no harm . 136 Wild Seed “
64414	64543	64408	64408	she	1717	” the girl said hopefully . That was when Doro took her into the kitchen to investigate the stew Anyanwu had left simmering and the bread untended in its bake kettle , hot and tender , unburned in the coals . They set the table , then Nweke suggested beer and popcorn . Doro agreed , humoring her , hoping she would relax and not worry about facing her mother . She seemed peaceful and content when Isaac and Anyanwu came in , yet she avoided her mother 's eyes . She stared down into her beer . Doro saw Anyanwu frown , saw her go to Nweke and take the small chin in her fingers and raise it so that she could see Nweke 's frightened eyes . "
64548	64733	64734	64734	Nweke	123	" she asked Nweke softly in her own language . She spoke perfect English now , along with Dutch and a few words of some Indian and foreign African dialects , but at home with her children , she often spoke as though she had never left home . She would not adopt a European name or call her children by their European names — though she had condescended to give them European names at Doro 's insistence . Her children could speak and understand as well as she could . Even Isaac , after all the years , could understand and speak fairly well . No doubt , he heard as clearly as Doro and Nweke the wariness and tension in Anyanwu 's soft question . Nweke did not answer . Frightened , she glanced at Doro . Anyanwu followed the glance and her infant - clear , bright eyes took on a look of incongruous ferocity . She said nothing . She only stared with growing comprehension . Doro met her gaze levelly until she turned back to look at her daughter . "
64743	64787	64734	64734	Nweke	123	” she whispered urgently . Something happened within Nweke . She took Anyanwu 's hands between her own , held them for a moment , smiling . Finally she laughed aloud - delighted child 's laughter with no hint of falseness or gloating . “
64792	64796	64788	64788	I	0	” she said . “
64826	64870	64871	64871	She	1721	” Relief made her forget her fear . She met Anyanwu 's eyes , her own eyes full of the wonder of her newfound peace . Anyanwu closed her eyes for a moment , drew a long , shuddering breath . Wild Seed 137 “
64876	64887	64871	64871	She	1721	” Isaac said from where he sat at the table . “
64892	64915	64871	64871	She	1721	" Anyanwu looked at him . Doro could not read what passed between them , but after a moment , Isaac repeated , “
64920	65253	64871	64871	She	1721	” And it seemed to be . At that moment , the twenty - two - year - old son Peter , incongruously called Chukwuka — God is Supreme - arrived , and dinner was served . Doro ate slowly , recalling how he had laughed at the boy 's Igbo name . He had asked Anyanwu where she had found her sudden devotion to God — any god . Chukwuka was a common enough name in her homeland , but it was not a name he would have expected from a woman who claimed she helped herself . Predictably , Anyanwu had been silent and unamused at his question . It took him a surprisingly long time to begin to wonder whether the name was supposed to be a charm - her pathetic attempt to protect the boy from him . Where had Anyanwu found her sudden devotion to God ? Where else but in her fear of Doro ? Doro smiled to himself . Then he stopped smiling as Nweke ’s brief peace ended . The girl screamed — a long , ragged , terrible sound that reminded Doro of cloth tearing . Then she dropped the dish of corn she had been bringing to the table and collapsed to the floor unconscious . CHAPTER 8 Nweke lay twitching , still unconscious in the middle of Isaac and Anyanwu 's bed . Anyanwu said it was easier to care for her here in a bed merely enclosed within curtains than in one of the alcove beds . Oblivious to Doro 's presence , Anyanwu had stripped Nweke to her shift and removed the pins from her hair . The girl looked even smaller than she was now , looked lost in the deep , soft feather mattress . She looked like a child . Doro felt a moment of unease , even fear for her . He remembered her laughter minutes earlier and wondered whether he would hear it again . “
65258	65307	65309	65309	you	1722	" Anyanwu said to him , neutral - voiced . He glanced at her . She stood beside the bed looking weary and concerned . Her earlier hostility had been set aside and only set aside . Doro knew her too well to think it had been forgotten . “
65312	65316	65309	65309	you	1722	” he asked . “
65327	65328	65325	65325	she	1723	” “
65341	65384	65337	65337	I	0	” He thought she was probably right . He sensed the girl very strongly now . If his body had been a lesser one or one he had given long use , he would not have dared to stay so near her . “
65389	65399	65386	65386	you	1722	" Anyanwu asked , as though hearing his thoughts . “
65404	65405	65386	65386	you	1722	” “
65418	65419	65408	65408	You	1722	” “
65425	65426	65408	65408	You	1722	” “
65432	65442	65408	65408	You	1722	” She gave him another of her venomous looks . “
65447	65455	65445	65445	Doro	60	” He did not pretend to misunderstand . “
65473	65474	65475	65475	She	1725	" “
65487	65488	65475	65475	She	1725	” “
65506	65507	65492	65492	She	1725	" “
65520	65521	65509	65509	you	1722	” “
65533	65575	65576	65576	You	60	” Wild Seed 139 Nweke made a small sound as though she were having a bad dream . No doubt she was . The worst of dreams . And she would not be permitted to wake fully until it was over . “
65584	65588	65576	65576	You	60	” she said . "
65596	65597	65592	65592	you	60	” "
65602	65609	65611	65611	you	60	” She turned to face him . “
65620	65621	65611	65611	you	60	” "
65625	65640	65611	65611	you	60	” His eyes looked past her for a moment though he did not move . “
65651	65845	65641	65641	I	0	” She turned a little too quickly and sat down beside the bed . She sat on a chair Isaac had made for her — a taller - than - normal chair so that in spite of her small size and the height of the bed , she could see and reach Nweke easily . Eventually she would move onto the bed with the girl . People in transition needed close physical contact to give them some hold on reality . But for now , Anyanwu 's move to the chair was to conceal emotion . Fear , Doro wondered , or shame or anger or hatred . . . . His last serious attempt to punish her had involved Nweke 's father . That attempt had stood between them all Nweke ’s life . Of all the things she considered that he had done to her , that was the worst . Yet it was a struggle she had come very near winning . Perhaps she had won . Perhaps that was why the incident could still make him uneasy . Doro shook his head , turned his attention to the girl . “
65856	65860	65847	65847	you	1730	” he asked . “
65873	65882	65847	65847	you	1730	" He ignored the sarcasm in her voice . “
65913	65914	65915	65915	I	0	” "
65938	65955	65936	65936	her	1730	” He had opened his mouth , but she held up a hand to stop him . “
65992	65993	65977	65977	you	1730	" “
65996	66077	65977	65977	you	1730	” he said , and shrugged . He took a chair from beside the fireplace and brought it to the foot of the bed . There , he waited . When Nweke came to , shaking and crying wildly , he spoke to her , but she did not seem to hear him . Anyanwu went onto the bed silent , grim - faced , and held the girl until her tears had slowed , until she had stopped shaking . “
66083	66089	66078	66078	You	1730	” Doro heard Anyanwu whisper . "
66108	66330	66105	66106	a goddess	1733	" That was all she had time to say . Nweke 's body stiffened . She made retching sounds and Anyanwu drew back from her slightly . But instead of vomiting , she went limp again , her consciousness gone to join someone else 's . Eventually , she seemed to come to again , but her open eyes were glazed and she made the kind of gibbering sounds Doro had heard in madhouses — especially in the madhouses to which his people had been consigned when their transitions caught them outside their settlements . Nweke 's face was like something out of a madhouse , too twisted and unrecognizable , covered with sweat , eyes , nose , and mouth streaming . Wearily , sadly , Doro got up to leave . There had been a time when he had to watch transitions — when no one else could be trusted not to run away or murder his writhing charge or perform some dangerous , stupid ritual of exorcism . But that was long ago . He was not only building a people now ; they were building themselves . It was no longer necessary for him to do everything , see everything . He looked back once as he reached the door and saw that Anyanwu was watching him . "
66352	66356	66357	66357	I	0	” she said . "
66365	66370	66357	66357	I	0	” he said angrily . “
66386	66816	66372	66372	I	0	" He turned and left her . When Doro had gone , Anyanwu clambered off the featherbed and went to the washstand . There she poured water from the pitcher to the basin and wet a towel . Nweke was having a difficult time already , poor girl . That meant a long , terrible night . There was no duty Anyanwu hated more than this — especially with her own children . But no one else could handle it as well as she could . She bathed the girl 's face , thinking , praying : Oh , Nweke , little one , stay until tomorrow . The pain will go away tomorrow . Nweke quieted as though she could hear the desperate thoughts . Perhaps she could . Her face was gray and still now . Anyanwu caressed it , seeing traces of the girl 's father in it as she always did . There was a man damned from the day of his birth — all because of Doro . He was fine breeding stock , oh yes . He was a forest animal Wild Seed 141 unable to endure the company of other people , unable to get any peace from their thoughts . He had not been as Nweke was now , receiving only large emotions , great stress . He received everything . And also , he saw visions of things far from him , beyond the range of even her eyes , of things closed away from any eyes . In a city , even in a small town , he would have gone mad . And his vulnerability was not a passing thing , not a transition from powerlessness to godlike power . It was a condition he had had to endure to the day of his death . He had loved Doro pathetically because Doro was the one person whose thoughts could not entangle him . His mind would not reach into Doro 's . Doro said this was a matter of self - preservation ; the mind that reached into his became his . It was consumed , extinguished , and Doro took over the body it had animated . Doro said even people like this man - Thomas , his name was even people whose mind - reading ability seemed completely out of control somehow never reached into Doro 's thoughts . People with control could force themselves to try — as they could force their hands into firebut they could not make the attempt without first feeling the “
66818	66834	66372	66372	I	0	” . and knowing they were doing a dangerous thing . Thomas could not force his “
66836	67730	66372	66372	I	0	” into anything at all . He lived alone in a filthy cabin well hidden within a dark , awesome Virginia woods . When Doro brought her to him , he cursed her . He told her she should not mind the way he lived , since she was from Africa where people swung through the trees and went naked like animals . He asked Doro what wrong he had done to be given a nigger woman . But it was not his wrong that had won him Anyanwu . It was hers . Now and then , Doro courted her in his own way . He arrived with a new body - sometimes an appealing one . He paid attention to her , treated her as something more than only a breeding animal . Then , courting done , he took her from Isaac 's bed to his own and kept her there until he was certain she was pregnant . Still , Isaac urged her to use these times to tie Doro to her and strengthen whatever influence she had with him . But Anyanwu never learned to forgive Doro 's unnecessary killings , his casual abuse when he was not courting her , his open contempt for any belief of hers that did not concur with his , the blows for which she could not retaliate and from which she could not flee , the acts she must perform for him no matter what her beliefs . She had lain with him as a man while he wore the body of a 142 Wild Seed woman . She had not been able to become erect naturally . He was a beautiful woman , but he repelled her . Nothing he did gave her pleasure . Nothing . No ... She sighed and stared down at her daughter 's still face . No , her children gave her pleasure . She loved them , but she also feared for them . Who knew what Doro might decide to do to them ? What would he do to this one ? She lay down close to Nweke , so that the girl would not awake alone . Perhaps even now , some part of Nweke 's spirit knew that Anyanwu was nearby . Anyanwu had seen that people in transition thrashed around less if she lay close to them and sometimes held them . If her nearness , her touch , gave them any peace , she was willing to stay close . Her thoughts returned to Thomas . Doro had been angry with her . He never seemed to get truly angry with anyone else — but then , his other people loved him . He could not tell her that he was angry because she did not love him . Even he could not utter such foolishness . Certainly , he did not love her . He did not love anyone except perhaps Isaac and a very few of his other children . Yet he wanted Anyanwu to be like his many other women and treat him like a god in human form , competing for his attention no matter how repugnant his latest body nor even whether he might be looking for a new body . They knew he took women almost as readily as he took men . Especially , he took women who had already given him what he wanted of them — usually several children . They served him and never thought they might be his next victims . Someone else . Not them . More than once , Anyanwu wondered how much time she might have left . Had Doro merely been waiting for her to help this last daughter through transition ? If so , he might be in for a surprise . Once Nweke had power and could care for herself , Anyanwu did not plan to stay in Wheatley . She had had enough of Doro and everything to do with him ; and no person was better fitted to escape him than she was . If only Thomas had been able to escape ... But Thomas had not had power - only potential , unrealized , unrealizable . He had had a long sparse beard when Doro took her to him , and long black hair clotted together with the grease and dirt of years of neglect . His clothing might have stood alone , starched as it was with layers of dirt and sweat , but it was too ragged to stand . In some places , it seemed to be held together by the dirt . There were Wild Seed 143 sores on his body , ignored and filthy — as though he were rotting away while still alive . He was a young man , but his teeth were almost gone . His breath , his entire body , stank unbelievably . And he did not care . He did not care about anything — beyond his next drink . He looked , except for the sparse beard , like an Indian , but he thought of himself as a white man . And he thought of Anyanwu as a nigger . Doro had known what he was doing when in exasperation , he had said to her , “
67758	67834	67835	67835	Doro	60	" And he gave her to Thomas . And he stayed to see that she did not run away or kill the grotesque ruin of a man instead of sharing his vermin - infested bed . But Anyanwu had never killed anyone except in self - defense . It was not her business to kill . She was a healer . At first , Thomas cursed her and reviled her blackness . She ignored this . “
67841	67847	67835	67835	Doro	60	” she told him calmly . "
67859	67860	67862	67862	your	0	” "
67865	67869	67862	67862	your	0	” he said . “
67893	68047	67890	67890	your	0	” She had not struck back . After the first moments , she had not even been angry . Nor had she been pitying or repelled . She knew Doro expected her to be repelled , but that proved nothing more than that he could know her for decades without really knowing her at all . This was a man sick in a dozen ways — the remnants of a man . Healer that she was , creator of medicines and poisons , binder of broken bones , comforter — could she take the remnants here and build them into a man again ? Doro looked at people , healthy or ill , and wondered what kind of young they could produce . Anyanwu looked at the sick — especially those with problems she had not seen before and wondered whether she could defeat their disease . Helplessly , Thomas caught her thoughts . “
68053	68058	68059	68059	You	1741	” he muttered alarmed . “
68070	68092	68064	68064	your	1741	” Heathen , yes . He was a god - fearing man himself . Anyanwu went to his god and said , “
68127	68168	68123	68123	he	645	" 144 Wild Seed Doro stared at her as though he could not think of anything to say . He was wearing a big burly body and had been using it to chop wood while Anyanwu and Thomas got acquainted . “
68175	68180	68123	68123	he	645	” he protested finally . “
68204	68205	68198	68198	He	131	” “
68217	68218	68198	68198	He	131	” “
68234	68417	68227	68227	he	131	" In anger that night , Anyanwu took her leopard form for the first time in years . She hunted deer , stalking them as she had at home so long ago , moving with the old stealth , using her eyes and her ears even more efficiently than a true leopard might . The result was as it had been at home . Deer were deer . She brought down a sleek doe , then took her human form again , threw her prize across her shoulders , and carried it to Thomas ' cabin . By morning , when the two men awoke , the doe had been skinned , cleaned , and butchered . The cabin was filled with the smell of roasting venison . Doro ate heartily and went out . He did n't ask where the fresh meat had come from or thank Anyanwu for it . He simply accepted it . Thomas was less trusting . He drank a little rum , sniffed at the meat Anyanwu gave him , nibbled at a little of it . “
68424	68428	68227	68227	he	131	” he demanded . “
68434	68438	68429	68429	I	0	” Anyanwu said . “
68444	68445	68439	68439	You	0	" "
68458	68459	68460	68460	I	0	" "
68475	68498	68472	68472	you	0	” She gestured toward where the gun , the cleanest thing in the cabin , hung from a peg by the door . “
68506	68540	68499	68499	I	0	” she added . He got up and checked the musket anyway . When he was satisfied , he came to stand over her , reeking and forcing her to breathe very shallowly . “
68549	68574	68543	68543	you	0	” he demanded . He was n't a big man , but sometimes , like now , he spoke in a deep rumbling voice . “
68580	68584	68577	68577	you	0	” he repeated . “
68590	68591	68577	68577	you	0	” “
68594	68612	68577	68577	you	0	” Anyanwu said softly . He stared at her for a moment , his eyes suddenly wide . “
68616	68620	68622	68622	woman	2747	” he whispered . “
68633	68695	68696	68696	I	0	” Doro had explained that since this man had never completed transition , he had no control over his ability . He could not deliberately look into Anyanwu 's thoughts , but he could not refrain Wild Seed 145 from looking into them either . Anyanwu was near him and her thoughts , unlike Doro 's , were open and unprotected . "
68701	68706	68696	68696	I	0	” she said simply . “
68717	68718	68713	68713	I	0	” “
68721	68722	68713	68713	I	0	” “
68730	68735	68736	68736	You	1752	” she reassured him . "
68761	68802	68736	68736	You	1752	” She would wash him , she decided . This day , she would wash him and start on the sores . The stink was unendurable . He snatched up his portion of food and threw it into the fire . "
68806	68865	68736	68736	You	1752	” he muttered , and turned his jug up to his mouth . Anyanwu stifled an impulse to throw the rum into the fire . Instead , she stood up and took it from his hands as he lowered it . He did not try to keep it from her . She set it aside and faced him . “
68871	68875	68868	68869	all witches	1754	” she said . “
68891	68895	68883	68883	he	60	” She shrugged . “
68909	68924	68925	68925	I	0	” He said nothing . Only stared at her with unmistakable suspicion and dislike . “
68933	68937	68938	68938	You	60	” she continued . “
68960	68961	68951	68951	I	0	" "
68967	68968	68951	68951	I	0	" “
69002	69345	69346	69347	My God	1350	" She was undressing as she spoke . It was not necessary . She could shrug out of the clothing as she changed , shed it as a snake sheds its skin , but she wanted to move very slowly for this man . She did not expect her nudity to excite him . He had seen her unclothed the night before and he had turned away and gone to sleep - leaving her to go hunting . She suspected that he was impotent . She had made her body slender and young for him , hoping to get his seed in her and escape quickly , but last night had convinced her that she had more work to do here than she had thought . And if the man was impotent , all that she did might not be enough . What would Doro do then ? She changed very slowly , took the leopard form , all the while keeping her body between Thomas and the door . Between Thomas and the gun . That was wise because when she had finished , when she stretched her small powerful cat - body and spread her claws leaving marks in the packed earth floor , he dived for his gun . 146 Wild Seed Claws sheathed , Anyanwu batted him aside . He screamed and shrank back from her . By his manner , arm thrown up to protect his throat , eyes wide , he seemed to expect her to leap upon him . He was waiting to die . Instead , she approached him slowly , her body relaxed . Purring , she rubbed her head against his knee . She looked up at him , saw that the protective arm had come down from the throat . She rubbed her fur against his leg and went on purring . Finally , almost unwillingly , his hand touched her head , caressed tentatively . When she had him scratching her neck — which did not itchand muttering to himself , "
69349	69370	69346	69347	My God	1350	” She broke away , went over and picked up a piece of venison and brought it back to him . “
69377	69563	69371	69371	I	0	” he said . She began to growl low in her throat . He took a step back but that put him against the rough log wall . When Anyanwu followed , there was nowhere for him to go . She tried to put the meat into his hand , but he snatched the hand away . Finally , around the meat , she gave a loud , coughing roar . Thomas sank to the floor terrified , staring at her . She dropped the meat into his lap and roared again . He picked it up and ate — for the first time in how long , she wondered . If he wanted to kill himself , why was he doing it in this slow terrible way , letting himself rot alive ? Oh , this day she would wash him and begin his healing . If he truly wanted to die , let him hang himself and be done with it . When he had finished the venison , she became a woman again and calmly put on her clothing as he watched . "
69569	69577	69564	69564	I	0	” he whispered after a long silence . “
69589	69599	69578	69578	I	0	" He shook his head uncomprehending , then asked : “
69605	69672	69601	69601	you	1758	” The question startled her . Was he really so concerned about her color ? Usually Doro 's people were not . Most of them had backgrounds too thoroughly mixed for them to sneer at anyone . Anyanwu did not know this man 's ancestry but she was certain he was not as white as he seemed to think . The Indian appearance was too strong . “
69680	69684	69673	69673	I	0	” she said . “
69703	69704	69705	69705	I	0	” "
69711	69715	69705	69705	I	0	” he said . “
69725	69726	69722	69722	you	0	” “
69729	69739	69740	69740	I	0	” Wild Seed 147 He stared at her hostilely . “
69744	69749	69740	69740	I	0	” she said finally . "
69814	69820	69821	69822	A dolphin	3379	” She smiled a little . “
69826	69827	69821	69822	A dolphin	3379	” “
69835	69871	69829	69829	you	0	” he asked . His hostility had died as she spoke . He seemed to believe her . Perhaps he was hearing her thoughts . If so , he was not hearing them clearly enough . "
69886	69895	69882	69882	I	0	" she said with hostility of her own . “
69913	69917	69903	69904	No one	2668	” He sighed . “
69934	69942	69947	69947	I	0	" He stopped , wet his lips . “
69964	69965	69966	69966	You	0	” “
69971	70016	69966	69966	You	0	" He rubbed at a scabbed over sore on his arm . Anyanwu could see it through a hole in his sleeve and it did not look as though it was healing properly . The flesh around the scab was very red and swollen . "
70022	70026	70019	70020	a wife	926	” he said . “
70098	70099	70091	70091	I	0	" “
70109	70118	70101	70101	she	926	” He gave her a look of contempt . “
70131	70132	70129	70129	anyone	2749	” “
70148	70149	70129	70129	anyone	2749	" “
70160	70244	70150	70150	You	0	” he said bitterly . His tone made her think , made her remember that some of the most terrible of Doro 's people were like Thomas . They were n't as sensitive , perhaps . Living in towns did n't seem to bother them . But they drank too much and fought and abused or neglected their children and occasionally murdered each other before Doro could get around to taking them . Thomas was probably right to marry a more ordinary woman . “
70251	70255	70258	70258	you	1778	” she asked . “
70321	70322	70315	70315	she	1779	" “
70328	70329	70324	70324	she	1779	” “
70382	70383	70378	70378	Doro	60	” “
70395	70396	70397	70397	You	0	” “
70407	70408	70397	70397	You	0	” “
70424	70432	70411	70411	you	0	” He blinked , looked at himself . “
70442	70443	70434	70434	I	0	” “
70470	70471	70459	70459	You	0	” “
70477	70478	70481	70481	She	1779	” "
70490	70491	70481	70481	She	1779	” “
70499	70500	70503	70503	She	1779	” "
70532	70533	70525	70525	I	0	” "
70542	70547	70534	70534	You	0	” he muttered sullenly . "
70569	70570	70566	70566	you	0	” "
70655	70701	70643	70643	You	0	” He stared at her , frowned intently as though reaching for a thought that eluded him . It occurred to her that he was trying to hear her thoughts . Finally , though , he seemed to give up . He shrugged and sighed . “
70710	70711	70703	70703	you	0	” "
70738	70739	70740	70740	You	0	" "
70754	70755	70752	70752	you	0	” “
70764	70765	70752	70752	you	0	” “
70784	70794	70776	70776	I	0	” Wild Seed 149 She shook her head sadly . "
70843	70844	70835	70835	I	0	" “
70858	70913	70914	70914	I	0	" Anyanwu understood the reference . She had read the sacred book of her new land , the Bible , in the hope of improving her understanding of the people around her . In Wheatley , Isaac told people she was becoming a Christian . Some of them did not realize he was joking . "
70921	70926	70914	70914	I	0	” she told Thomas . “
70946	70958	70941	70941	I	0	” He glanced at her , then down at the floor . “
70969	70975	70960	70960	I	0	” He spoke very softly . “
70981	70982	70976	70976	I	0	” “
71008	71039	70995	70995	he	60	” It was as though she had said something startling . He jumped , peered at her in a way that made her draw back in alarm , then demanded : “
71079	71080	71081	71081	You	0	” “
71092	71104	71081	71081	You	0	" Even through the dirt , she could see him redden . “
71109	71116	71105	71105	I	0	” he said after several seconds . “
71133	71134	71119	71119	I	0	" “
71141	71142	71135	71135	I	0	" "
71160	71161	71156	71156	I	0	” “
71168	71169	71162	71162	People	2648	” “
71209	71213	71198	71198	He	60	” She smiled . “
71230	71268	71215	71215	he	60	” Thomas said nothing for so long that she reached out and touched his hand , concerned . He looked at her , smiled without showing his bad teeth . She had not seen him smile before . “
71272	71276	71215	71215	he	60	” he said . “
71288	71289	71290	71290	He	60	" "
71296	71297	71290	71290	He	60	" “
71310	71311	71312	71312	I	0	” “
71316	71327	71312	71312	I	0	" she agreed bitterly . 150 Wild Seed He sighed . “
71364	71378	71358	71362	anyone who did be fore	1802	” He hesitated again , raised his night - black eyes to hers . “
71383	71412	71358	71362	anyone who did be fore	1802	” She nodded , thinking that he reminded her of Isaac . Isaac too was always cautioning her . Then Thomas got up and went to the door . “
71418	71422	71415	71415	you	0	” she asked . "
71431	71438	71415	71415	you	0	” The smile again , tentatively . “
71462	71463	71451	71451	I	0	” "
71491	71492	71493	71493	I	0	” “
71511	71656	71498	71498	you	0	” he muttered , and closed the door behind him . Anyanwu went out and fashioned a crude broom of twigs . She swept the mounds of litter out of the cabin , then washed what could be washed . She did not know what to do about the vermin . The fleas alone were terrible . Left to herself , she would have burned the cabin and built another . But Thomas would not be likely to go along with that . She cleaned and cleaned and cleaned and the terrible little cabin still did not suit her . There were no clean blankets , there was no clean clothing for Thomas . Eventually , he came in wearing the same filthy rags over skin scrubbed pale and nearly raw . He seemed acutely embarrassed when Anyanwu began stripping the rags from him . "
71662	71667	71498	71498	you	0	” she told him . “
71688	71712	71498	71498	you	0	" He became erect . Scrawny and sick as his body was , he was , as he had said , not impotent . “
71716	71723	71498	71498	you	0	” murmured Anyanwu with gentle amusement . “
71733	71749	71498	71498	you	0	" His clumsy fingers had begun fumbling with her clothing , but they stopped suddenly . “
71752	71766	71498	71498	you	0	” he said as though the pain had to come first after all . "
71769	71777	71498	71498	you	0	" He turned his back to her . “
71782	71791	71792	71792	You	1806	” Anyanwu laid a hand on his shoulder . “
71808	71822	71805	71805	I	0	” He spoke through his teeth as though every word was hurting him . “
71842	71846	71805	71805	I	0	” Wild Seed 151 “
71849	71866	71805	71805	I	0	” She rubbed the shoulder , feeling the bones sharply through their thin covering of flesh . “
71880	71924	71867	71868	The women	963	” He said nothing . She stepped closer to him . He was smaller than Isaac , smaller than most of the male bodies Doro brought her . It was strange to be able to meet a man 's eyes without looking up . “
71934	71938	71867	71868	The women	963	” she said . “
71984	72157	71977	71977	I	0	” He stared at her for a moment , the black eyes intent as though again he was trying to control his ability , hear her thoughts now when he wanted to hear them . She found herself hoping her child his child — would have those eyes . They were the only things about him that had never needed cleaning or healing to show their beauty . That was surprising considering how much he drank . He seized her suddenly , as though it had just occurred to him that he could , and held her tightly for long moments before leading her to his splintery shelf bed . Doro came in hours later , bringing flour , sugar , coffee , corn meal , salt , eggs , butter , dry peas , fresh fruit and vegetables , blankets , cloth that could be sewn into clothing , and , incidentally a new body . He had bought or stolen someone 's small crudely made wagon to carry his things . “
72161	72289	72159	72159	you	1810	” Anyanwu told him gravely , wanting him to see that her gratitude was real . It was rare these days for him to do what she asked . She wondered why he had bothered this time . Certainly he had not planned to the day before . Then she saw him looking at Thomas . The bath had made the most visible difference in Thomas ' appearance , and Anyanwu had shaved him , cut off much of his hair , and combed the rest . But there were other more subtle changes . Thomas was smiling , was helping to carry the supplies into the cabin instead of standing aside apathetically , instead of muttering at Anyanwu when she passed him , her arms full . “
72292	72305	72159	72159	you	1810	” he said , happily oblivious to Doro 's eyes on him . “
72319	72363	72316	72317	Sun Woman	62	” That stupid name , she thought desperately . Why had he called her 152 Wild Seed that ? He must have read it in her thoughts . She had not told him it was Doro 's name for her . Doro smiled . “
72374	72380	72367	72367	you	1812	” he said to her . “
72391	72392	72381	72381	I	0	” "
72398	72423	72395	72396	a healer	1701	” she said . His smile terrified her for Thomas ' sake . It was a smile full of teeth and utterly without humor . “
72428	72526	72424	72424	I	0	" she said , though she had not meant to tell him that for days --perhaps weeks . Suddenly , though , she wanted him away from Thomas . She knew Doro . Over the years , she had come to know him very well . He had given her to a man he hoped would repel her , make her know how well off she had been . Instead , she had immediately begun helping the man , healing him so that eventually he would not repel anyone . Clearly , she had not been punished . “
72529	72536	72395	72396	a healer	1701	” Doro said in mock surprise . “
72542	72543	72395	72396	a healer	1701	” “
72546	72584	72395	72396	a healer	1701	” He glanced toward the cabin where Thomas was . Anyanwu came around the wagon and caught Doro 's arms . He was wearing the body of a round - faced very young - looking white man . “
72592	72596	72587	72587	you	1815	” she demanded . “
72601	72606	72597	72597	You	1815	” he said reasonably . “
72615	72616	72597	72597	You	1815	” “
72630	72643	72619	72619	you	1815	” Thomas came out of the cabin and saw them standing together . “
72648	72678	72619	72619	you	1815	” he asked . Anyanwu realized later that it was probably her expression or her thoughts that alerted him . If only he could have read Doro 's thoughts . “
72685	72699	72700	72700	Anyanwu	61	” said Doro blandly . Thomas stared at her with disbelief and pain . “
72705	72746	72700	72700	Anyanwu	61	” She did not know what to do what would make Doro feel that he had extracted enough pain , punished her enough . What would stop him now that he had decided to kill ? She looked at Doro . “
72754	72758	72747	72747	I	0	” she whispered . “
72768	72769	72761	72761	I	0	” “
72774	72786	72787	72787	Doro	60	” Doro said . She shook her head , pleaded desperately : "
72804	72834	72835	72835	I	0	” Thomas had come closer to them , looking at Anyanwu , his expression caught between anger and pain . Anyanwu wanted to shout at him to stay away . “
72841	72847	72835	72835	I	0	” Doro said to her . “
72852	72857	72835	72835	I	0	“ For himnted them , "
72883	73136	73137	73137	Doro	60	” She was in the midst of a healing . She had endured abuse from Thomas . She had endured part of a night beside his filthy body . Finally , she had been able to reach him and begin to heal . It was not only the sores on his body she was reaching for . Never had Doro taken a patient from her in the midst of healing , never ! Somehow , she had not thought he would do such a thing . It was as though he had threatened one of her children . And , of course , he was threatening her children . He was threatening everything dear to her . He was not finished with her , apparently , and thus would not kill her . But since she had made it clear that she did not love him , that she obeyed him only because he had power , he felt some need to remind her of that power . If he could not do it by giving her to an evil man because that man obstinately ceased to be evil , then he would take that man from her now while her interest in him was strongest . And also , perhaps Doro had realized the thing she had told Thomasthat she would rather share Thomas ' bed than Doro 's . For a man accustomed to adoration , that realization must have been a heavy blow . But what could she do ? “
73139	73143	73137	73137	Doro	60	” she pleaded , “
73165	73248	73156	73156	I	0	” She was clinging to both his arms now , and lowering her head before the smooth young face . Inside , she screamed with rage and fear and loathing . Outside , her face was as smooth as his . But out of stubbornness or hunger or a desire to hurt her , he would not stop . He turned toward Thomas . And by now , Thomas understood . Thomas backed away , his disbelief again clear in his expression . “
73251	73255	73156	73156	I	0	” he said . “
73261	73262	73258	73258	I	0	” "
73265	73291	73292	73292	You	0	” shouted Anyanwu suddenly , and her hands on Doro 's arms locked suddenly in a grip Doro would not break in any normal way . “
73324	73333	73307	73307	he	1817	” For an instant , Thomas stood frozen . "
73336	73410	73411	73411	I	0	” screamed Anyanwu . Doro had actually begun struggling against her - no doubt a reflex of anger . He knew he could not break her grip or overcome her by physical strength alone . And he Wou . 154 Wild Seed would not use his other weapon . He was not finished with her yet . There was a potentially valuable child in her womb . Thomas ran off toward the woods . “
73416	73420	73411	73411	I	0	” shouted Doro . “
73426	73433	73434	73434	He	0	” Thomas stopped , looked back . "
73438	73461	73434	73434	He	0	” Anyanwu said almost gleefully . Man or devil , he could not get a lie past her . Not any longer . “
73471	73510	73466	73466	He	0	” Doro tried to hit her , but she tripped him , and as he fell , she changed her grip on his arms so that he would not move again except in pain . Very much pain . "
73516	73523	73524	73524	I	0	” she hissed into his ear . “
73530	73531	73524	73524	I	0	” "
73536	73540	73524	73524	I	0	” he said , “
73561	73640	73645	73645	Anyanwu	61	” There was death frighteningly close to the surface in his voice . This was the way he sounded when he truly meant to kill — his voice went flat and strange and Anyanwu felt that the thing he was , the spirit , the feral hungry demon , the twisted ogbanje was ready to leap out of his young man 's body and into hers . She had pushed him too far . Then Thomas was there . "
73647	73692	73645	73645	Anyanwu	61	” he said . She jerked her head up to stare at him . She had risked everything to give him a chance to escape — at least a chance — and he had come back . He tried to pull her off Doro . “
73722	73813	73714	73715	nobody else	1820	” Anyanwu looked around and realized that he was right . When Doro transferred , he took the person nearest to him . That was why he sometimes touched people . In a crowd , the contact assured his taking the one person he had chosen . If he decided to transfer , though , and the person nearest to him was a hundred miles away , he would take that person . Distance meant nothing . If he was willing to go through Anyanwu , he could reach Thomas . "
73819	73824	73814	73814	I	0	” Thomas was saying . “
73858	73946	73852	73852	your	3799	” With far less strength than Doro had in his current body , he pulled her to her feet , freeing Doro . Then he pushed her behind him so that he stood nearest to Doro . Wild Seed 155 Doro stood up slowly , watching them as though daring them to run — or encouraging them to panic and run hopelessly . Nothing human looked out of his eyes . Seeing him , Anyanwu thought she would die anyway . Both she and Thomas would die . "
73951	73970	73971	73971	I	0	” Thomas said to him as though to a reasonable man . Doro 's eyes focused on him . “
73976	73980	73971	73971	I	0	” Thomas repeated . “
73985	73996	73981	73981	I	0	” He shook his head slowly from side to side . "
74010	74020	74003	74003	I	0	” He held out a remarkably steady right hand . “
74031	74123	74003	74003	I	0	” he said . Without a word , Doro grasped the hand . At his touch , the smooth young body he had worn collapsed and Thomas ' body , thin and full of sores , stood a little straighter . Anyanwu stared at him wide - eyed , terrified in spite of herself . In an instant , the eyes of a friend had become demon 's eyes . Would she be killed now ? Doro had promised nothing . Had not even given his worshiper a word of kindness . “
74127	74289	74290	74290	I	0	” Doro said to her from Thomas ' mouth . He gestured toward his own former body . She began to cry . Shame and relief made her turn away from him . He was going to let her live . Thomas had bought her life . Thomas ' hand caught her by the shoulder and shoved her toward the body . She hated her tears . Why was she so weak ? Thomas had been strong . He had lived no more than thirty - five years , yet he had found the strength to face Doro and save her . She had lived many times thirty - five years and she wept and cowered . This was what Doro had made of her — and he could not understand why she hated him . He came to stand over her and somehow she kept herself from cringing away . He seemed taller in Thomas ' body than Thomas had . “
74297	74308	74290	74290	I	0	” she whispered . She had not intended to whisper . “
74313	74796	74310	74310	your	0	” he said . She found a shovel in the cabin , and an adz that she could swing to break up the earth — probably the same tool Thomas had used to dress the timbers of his cabin . As she dug the grave , Doro stood watching her . He never moved to help , never spoke , never looked away . By the time she had finished a suitable hole - rough and oblong rather than rectangular , but large and deep enough — she was 156 Wild Seed trembling . The gravedigging had tired her more than it should have . It was hard work and she had done it too quickly . A man half again her size would not have finished so soon — or perhaps he would have , with Doro watching over him . What was Doro thinking ? Did he mean to kill her after all ? Would he bury Thomas ' body with the earlier nameless one and walk away clothed in her flesh ? She went to the young man 's body , straightened it , and wrapped it in some of the linen Doro had brought . Then , somehow , she struggled it into the grave . She was tempted to ask Doro to help , but one look at his face changed her mind . He would not help . He would curse her . She shuddered . She had not seen him make a kill since their trip from her homeland . He did kill , of course , often . But he was private about it . He arrived in Wheatley wearing one body and left wearing another , but he did not make the change in public . Also , he usually left as soon as he had changed . If he meant to stay in town for a while , he stayed wearing the body of a stranger . He did not let his people forget what he was , but his reminders were discreet and surprisingly gentle . If they had not been , Anyanwu thought as she filled in the grave , if Doro flaunted his power before others as he was flaunting it now before her , even his most faithful worshipers would have fled from him . His way of killing would terrify anyone . She looked at him and saw Thomas ' thin face recently shaved by her own hand , recently taught a small , thin - lipped smile . She looked away , trembling . Somehow , she finished filling in the grave . She tried to think of a white man 's prayer to say for the nameless corpse , and for Thomas . But with Doro watching her , her mind refused to work . She stood empty and weary and frightened over the grave . “
74806	74810	74798	74798	you	1827	” Doro said . “
74821	74842	74843	74843	I	0	” Thus she would live for a while . He telling her she would live . She met his eyes . “
74854	74855	74310	74310	your	0	” “
74859	74860	74861	74861	I	0	” "

74895	74899	74861	74861	I	0	” Doro laughed . “
74905	74909	74861	74861	I	0	” he said . “
74919	74923	74910	74910	I	0	” Wild Seed 157 “
74940	75027	75028	75028	I	0	" She did not want to touch him , even in healing . She had not minded touching Thomas , had quickly come to like the man in spite of his wretchedness . Without his uncontrolled ability hurting him , he would have been a good man . In the end , he was a good man . She would willingly bury his body when Doro left it , but she did not want to touch it while Doro wore it . Perhaps Doro knew that . "
75034	75038	75028	75028	I	0	” he ordered . “
75052	76901	76902	76902	She	1828	” She took him into the cabin , stripped him , and went over the sick , scrawny body again . When she finished , he made her undress and lie with him . She did not weep because she thought that would please him . But afterward , for the first time in centuries , she was uncontrollably sick . CHAPTER 9 Nweke had begun to scream . Doro listened calmly , accepting the fact that the girl 's fate was temporarily out of his hands . There was nothing for him to do except wait and remind himself of what Anyanwu had said . She had never lost anyone to transition . She would not be likely to tarnish that record with the death of one of her own children . And Nweke was strong . All Anyanwu 's children were strong . That was important . Doro 's personal experience with transition had taught him the danger of weakness . He let his thoughts go back to the time of his own transition and away from worry over Nweke . He could remember his transition very clearly . There were long years following it that he could not remember , but his childhood and the transition that ended that childhood were still clear to him . He had been a sickly , stunted boy , the last of his mother 's twelve children and the only one to survive — just right for the name Anyanwu sometimes called him : Ogbanje . People said his brothers and sisters had been robust healthy - looking babies , and they had died . He had been scrawny and tiny and strange , and only his parents seemed to think it right that he had lived . People whispered about him . They said he was something other than a child — some spirit . They whispered that he was not the son of his mother 's husband . His mother shielded him as best she could while he was very young , and his father — if the man was his father - claimed him and was pleased to have a son . He was a poor man and had little else . His parents were all he could recall that had been good about his youth . Both had loved and valued him extravagantly after eleven dead babies . Other people avoided him when they could . His were a tall , stately people — Nubians , they came to be called much later . It soon became clear to them that Doro would never be tall or stately . Eventually , it also became clear that he was possessed . He heard voices . He fell to the ground writhing with fits . Several people , fearful that he might loose his devils on them , wanted to kill him , but Wild Seed 159 somehow , his parents protected him . Even then , he had not known how . But there was little , perhaps nothing , they would not have done to save him . He was thirteen when the full agony of transition hit him . He knew now that that was too young . He had never known one of his witches to live when transition came that early . He had not lived himself . But unlike anyone he had managed to breed so far , he had not quite died either . His body had died , and for the first time , he had transferred to the living human body nearest to him . This was the body of his mother in whose lap his head had rested . He found himself looking down at himself — at his own bodyand he did not understand . He screamed . Terrified , he tried to run away . His father stopped him , held him , demanded to know what had happened . He could not answer . He looked down , saw his woman 's breasts , his woman 's body , and he panicked . Without knowing how or what he did , he transferred again — this time to his father . In his once quiet Nile River village , he killed and killed and killed . Finally , his people 's enemies inadvertently rescued them . Raiding Egyptians captured him as they attacked the village . By then , he was wearing the body of a young girl — one of his cousins . Perhaps he killed some of the Egyptians too . He hoped so . His people had lived without the interference of Egypt for nearly two centuries while Egypt wallowed in feudal chaos . But now Egypt was back , wanting land , mineral wealth , slaves . Doro hoped he had killed many of them . He would never know . His memory stopped with the arrival of the Egyptians . There was a gap of what he later calculated to be about fifty years before he came to himself again and discovered that he had been thrown into an Egyptian prison , discovered that he now possessed the body of some middle - aged stranger , discovered that he was both more and less than a man , discovered that he could have and do absolutely anything . It had taken him years to decide even approximately how long he had been out of his mind . It took more time to learn exactly where his village had been and that it was no longer there . He never found any of his kinsmen , anyone from his village . He was utterly alone . Eventually , he began to realize that some of his kills gave him more pleasure than others . Some bodies sustained him longer . Observing his own reactions , he learned that age , race , sex , physical appearance , and except in extreme cases , health , did not affect his enjoyment of victims . He could and did take anyone . But what gave 160 Wild Seed the greatest pleasure was something he came to think of as witchcraft or a potential for witchcraft . He was seeking out his spiritual kin — people possessed or mad or just a little strange . They heard voices , saw visions , other things . He did none of those things any longer — not since his transition ended . But he fed on those who did . He learned to sense them effortlessly - like following an aroma of food . Then he learned to gather reserves of them , breed them , see that they were protected and cared for . They , in turn , learned to worship him . After a single generation , they were his . He had not understood this , but he had accepted it . A few of them seemed to sense him as clearly as he sensed them . Their witch - power warned them but never seemed to make them flee sensibly . Instead , they came to him , competed for his attention , loved him as god , parent , mate , friend . He learned to prefer their company to that of more normal people . He chose his companions from among them and restricted his killing to the others . Slowly , he created the Isaacs , the Annekes , the best of his children . These he loved as they loved him . They accepted him as ordinary people could not , enjoyed him , felt little or no fear of him . In one way , it was as though he repeated his own history with each generation . His best children loved him without qualification as his parents had . The others , like the other people of his village , viewed him through their various superstitions — though at least this time the superstitions were favorable . And this time , it was not his loved ones who fed his hunger . He plucked the others from their various settlements like ripe , sweet fruit and kept his special ones safe from all but sickness , old age , war , and sometimes , the dangerous effects of their own abilities . Occasionally , this last forced him to kill one of his special ones . One of them , drunk with his own power , displayed his abilities , drew attention to himself , and endangered his people . One of them refused to obey . One of them simply went mad . It happened . These were the kills he should have enjoyed most . Certainly , on a sensory level , they were the most pleasurable . But in Doro 's mind , these killings were too much like what he had done accidentally to his parents . He never kept these bodies long . He consciously avoided mirrors until he could change again . At these times more than any others , he felt again utterly alone , forever alone , longing to die and be finished . What was he , he wondered , that he could have anything at all but an end ? Wild Seed 161 People like Isaac and soon Nweke did not know how safe they were from him . People like Anyanwu - good , stable wild seed - did not know how safe they could be — though for Anyanwu herself , it was too late . Years too late , in spite of Isaac 's occasional pleas for her . Doro did not want the woman any longer — did not want her condemning stare , her silent , palpable hatred , her long - lived , grudge - holding presence . As soon as she was of no more use to Isaac , she would die . Isaac paced around the kitchen , restless and frightened , unable to shut out the sound of Nweke 's screams . It was difficult for him not to go to her . He knew there was nothing he could do , no help he could give . People in transition did not respond well to him . Anyanwu could hold them and pet them and become their mother whether she actually was or not . And in their pain , they clung to her . If Isaac tried to comfort them , they struggled against him . He had never understood that . They always seemed to like him well enough before and after transition . Nweke loved him . She had grown up calling him father , knowing he was not her father , and never caring . She was not Doro 's daughter either , but Isaac loved her too much to tell her that . He longed to be with her now to still the screaming and take away the pain . He sat down heavily and stared toward the bedroom . "
76908	76928	76902	76902	She	1828	” Doro said from the table , where he was eating a sweet cake Isaac had found for him . "
76936	76940	76941	76941	Her	1828	” Isaac challenged . “
76951	76952	76946	76946	She	1828	” “
76964	76965	76960	76960	I	0	” "
76970	76983	76966	76966	You	0	” Doro said reasonably . Isaac rubbed a hand across his forehead . "
77008	77009	77006	77006	Anyanwu	61	” “
77013	77030	77006	77006	Anyanwu	61	” Doro said . He looked at Isaac , smiled as though at some secret joke . “
77043	77047	77041	77041	she	1828	” Isaac asked . “
77050	77064	77041	77041	she	1828	” Doro 's expression did not change . The smile remained in place . “
77070	77074	77075	77075	She	1828	” Isaac said . “
77110	77114	77117	77117	she	1828	” 162 Wild Seed “

77125	77160	77122	77122	It	1833	” Isaac stared at the bedroom door , imagining the favored young stepdaughter turning vicious and bitter like his long - dead half - brother Lale , like his mother who had hanged herself . “
77165	77170	77122	77122	It	1833	” he repeated sadly . “
77181	77213	77214	77214	I	0	” Poor Nweke . Even transition would not mean an end to her pain . Should he wish her life or death ? And what should he wish for her mother ? "
77230	77234	77235	77235	Anneke	104	” Doro said . “
77240	77241	77235	77235	Anneke	104	" “

77277	77298	77268	77268	she	104	" Doro 's tone indicated that he did not wish to discuss Nweke 's ancestry . Isaac changed his approach . “
77308	77312	77319	77319	her	61	” he said . “
77340	77341	77343	77343	you	0	” "
77345	77373	77343	77343	you	0	” Nweke had stopped screaming . The room was suddenly still and silent except for Isaac 's two words . Doro swallowed the last of his sweet . “
77380	77381	77374	77374	You	0	” “
77397	77455	77456	77456	I	0	" Doro looked at him — a look Isaac had come to recognize , a look that gave him permission to say what Doro would not hear from others . Over the years , Isaac 's usefulness and loyalty had won him the right to say what he felt and be heard — though not necessarily heeded . “
77464	77472	77456	77456	I	0	” Doro said quietly . Isaac nodded . "
77483	77489	77477	77477	I	0	” He rubbed his chest . “

77569	77582	77583	77583	She	61	" * * Doro said nothing . He watched Isaac without expression . “
77590	77594	77583	77583	She	61	” Isaac said . “
77600	77607	77608	77608	Her	61	” Doro asked . Wild Seed 163 "
77611	77620	77608	77608	Her	61	” Isaac paused , but Doro said nothing . “

77960	77992	77993	77993	You	0	” Doro had begun to watch Isaac with greater interest , causing Isaac to wonder whether he had really been too set in his ways to see the woman 's value . “
78002	78009	77995	77995	you	0	” Doro said . Isaac nodded . “

78165	78177	78159	78159	He	497	” Isaac heard the implied threat and faced Doro with annoyance . “
78188	78193	78179	78179	you	1851	” he asked quietly . "
78263	78512	78513	78513	Nweke	123	” Deliberately , Isaac extended his hand to Doro . Doro stared at him for a moment , then gave a long sigh and clasped the large , calloused hand in his own briefly , harmlessly . For a time , they sat together in relaxed silence , Doro getting up once to put another log on the fire . Isaac let his thoughts go back to Anyanwu , and it occurred to him that what he had said of himself might also be true of her . She might be another of the very few people who could escape Doro — the way she could change her form and travel anywhere . . . Perhaps that was one of the things that bothered Doro about her . Though it should n't have . Doro should have let her go wherever she chose , do whatever she chose . He should only see her now and then when he was feeling lonely , when people died and left him , as everyone but her had to leave him . She was a healer in more ways than Doro seemed to understand . Nweke 's father had probably understood . And now , in her pain , no doubt Nweke understood . Ironically , Anyanwu herself often seemed not to understand . She thought the sick came to her only for her medicines and her knowledge . Within herself , she had something she did not know she had . “
78525	78536	78513	78513	Nweke	123	" Doro said as though responding to Isaac 's thoughts . “
78548	78549	78541	78541	her	123	” “
78557	78562	78554	78554	she	123	” Isaac said wearily . “
78596	78607	78608	78609	Oh God	76	” Nweke began screaming again — hoarse , terrible sounds . “
78611	78615	78608	78609	Oh God	76	” Isaac whispered . "
78626	78634	78616	78616	Her	123	” Doro said . Then , offhandedly , “
78644	78730	78731	78731	Doro	60	” Isaac knew him too well to be surprised . He got up to get the plate of fruit - filled Dutch olijkoecks that Anyanwu had made earlier . It was rare for another person 's pain to disturb Doro . If the girl seemed to be dying , he would be concerned that good seed was Wild Seed 165 about to be lost . But if she were merely in agony , it did not matter . Isaac forced his thoughts back to Anyanwu . “
78733	78864	78731	78731	Doro	60	” He spoke so softly that the girl 's screams almost drowned his single word . But Doro looked up . He held Isaac 's gaze , not questioningly or challengingly , not with any reassurance or compassion . He only looked back . Isaac had seen cats stare at people that way . Cats . That was apt . More and more often , nothing human looked out of Doro 's eyes . When Anyanwu was angry , she said Doro was only a man pretending to be a god . But she knew better . No man could frighten her — and Doro , whatever he had failed to accomplish with her , had taught her to fear him . He had taught Isaac to fear for him . “
78870	78874	78867	78867	you	1858	” Isaac said , “
78882	78883	78884	78884	I	0	” “
78905	78922	78898	78898	I	0	” He sounded tired — good , honest , human weariness , annoyance , and frustration . “
78939	78960	78898	78898	I	0	” Doro frowned , looked as harassed as Isaac had ever seen him . Surely that was a good sign . “
78965	78969	78898	78898	I	0	” he said . “
79013	79112	79001	79001	She	61	" He said nothing more . It was not good to try to get promises from Doro . Isaac had learned that long ago . It was best to push him almost to agreement , then leave him alone . Sometimes that worked . Sometimes Isaac did it well enough to save lives . And sometimes he failed . They sat together , Doro slowly eating olijkoecks and Isaac listening to the sounds of pain from the bedroom — until those sounds ceased , Nweke 's voice all but gone . The hours passed . Isaac made coffee . “
79117	79122	79113	79113	You	1859	” Doro told him . “
79139	79146	79113	79113	You	1859	” Isaac shook his head wearily . "
79154	79155	79149	79149	I	0	” “
79175	79209	79171	79171	You	1859	” Doro took Isaac by the shoulder and steered him into one of the bedrooms . The room was dark and cold , but Doro made a fire and lit a single candle . “
79217	79221	79211	79211	I	0	” he asked . “
79224	79308	79211	79211	I	0	” Isaac said gratefully . Doro brought a chair . The screaming began again , and for a moment it confused Isaac . 166 Wild Seed The girl 's voice had become only a hoarse whisper long ago , and except for an occasional jarring or creaking of the bed and the harsh , ragged breathing of the two women , the house had been silent . Now there was screaming . Isaac sat up suddenly and put his feet on the floor . “
79314	79347	79350	79350	you	0	” Doro asked . Isaac barely heard him . Suddenly he was up and running toward the other bedroom . Doro tried to stop him but Isaac brushed the restraining hands away . “
79353	79357	79350	79350	you	0	” he shouted . “
79367	79695	79365	79365	Anyanwu	61	” It seemed to Doro that Nweke 's transition was ending . The time was right - early morning , a few hours before dawn . The girl had survived the usual ten to twelve hours of agony . For some time now , she had been silent , not screaming , or groaning or even moving around enough to shake the bed . That was not to say , though , that she could not move . Actually , the final hours of transition were the most dangerous . They were the hours in which people lost control of their bodies , not only feeling what others felt , but moving as others moved . This was the time when someone like Anyanwu , physically strong , unafraid , and comforting was essential . Anyanwu herself was perfect because she could not be hurt - or at least , not in any permanent way . Doro 's people had told him this was the time they suffered most , too . This was the time when the madness of absorbing everyone else 's feelings seemed endless — when , in desperation , they would do anything to stop the pain . Yet this was also the time when they began to feel there was a way just beyond their reach — a way of controlling the madness , shutting themselves away from it . A way of finding peace . But instead of peace for Nweke , there was more screaming , and there was Isaac springing up like a boy , running for the door , shouting that the screams were not Nweke 's , but Anyanwu 's . And Isaac was right . What had happened ? Had Anyanwu been unable to keep the girl alive in spite of her healing ability ? Or was it something else , some other trouble with transition ? What could make the formidable Anyanwu scream that way ? "
79700	79708	79365	79365	Anyanwu	61	” Isaac cried from within the bedroom . “
79717	79851	79714	79715	My God	1350	” Doro ran into the room , stood near the door staring . Anyanwu lay Wild Seed 167 on the floor , bleeding from her nose and mouth . Her eyes were closed and she made no sound now at all . She seemed only barely alive . On the bed , Nweke sat up , her body half concealed by the feather mattress . She was staring down at Anyanwu . Isaac had stopped for a moment beside Anyanwu . He shook her as though to rouse her and her head lolled over bonelessly . He looked up and saw Nweke 's face over a bulge of feather - filled cloth . Before Doro could guess what he meant to do Isaac seized the girl , slapped her hard across the face . "
79858	79862	79854	79854	you	1863	” he shouted . “
79871	80113	79866	79866	She	1864	” Nweke put a hand to her face , her expression startled , uncomprehending . Doro realized that before Isaac 's blow , her face had held no expression at all . She had looked at Anyanwu , fallen and bleeding , with no more interest than she might have expressed in a stone . She had looked , but she had almost certainly not seen - did not see now . Perhaps she felt the pain of Isaac 's blow . Perhaps she heard him shouting — though Doro doubted that she was able to distinguish words . All that reached her was pain , noise , confusion . And she had had enough of all three . Her small , pretty , empty face contorted , and Isaac screamed . It had happened before . Doro had seen it happen . Some people 's bodies survived transition well enough , but their minds did not . They gained power and control of that power , but they lost all that would have made that power meaningful or useful . Why had Doro been so slow to understand ? What if the damage to Isaac could not be repaired ? What if both Isaac and Nweke were lost ? Doro stepped over Anyanwu and around Isaac , who was now writhing on the floor , and to the girl . He seized her , slapped her as Isaac had done . "
80118	80605	79866	79866	She	1864	” he said , not shouting at all . If his voice reached her , she would live . If it did not , she would die . Gods , let it reach her . Let her have her chance to come back to her senses — if she had any left . She drew back from Doro like a cornered animal . Whatever she had done to hurt Isaac and perhaps kill Anyanwu , she did nothing to Doro . His voice had reached her_after a fashion . She half leaped and half fell from the bed to get away from him and somehow she landed on Isaac . Anyanwu was farther away , as though she had been trying to escape when Nweke struck her down . 168 Wild Seed Also , Anyanwu was unconscious . She would probably never have known it if the girl had landed on her . But Isaac knew , and he reacted instantly to this new pain . He gripped Nweke , threw her upward away from his pain - racked body - threw her upward with all the power he had used so many times to propel great ships out of storms . He did not know what he was doing any more than she did . He never saw her hit the ceiling , never saw her body flatten into it , distorted , crushed , never saw her head slam into one of the great beams and break and send down a grisly rain of blood and bits of bone and brain . Her body fell toward Doro , rag - limp and ruined . Somehow he caught it , kept it from landing on Isaac again . The girl was lost . She would have been lost with such wounds had she been twice the healer Doro had hoped for . He put her body on the bed hastily and bent to see whether Isaac was also lost . Later , he would feel this . Later , perhaps he would leave Wheatley - leave it for several years . Isaac 's face was pale — a gray , ugly color . He was still now , very still though not quite unconscious . Doro could hear him panting , trying to catch his breath . Trouble with his heart , he had said . Could Nweke have aggravated that somehow ? Why not ? Who was more suited to causing illness than one born to cure it ? Desperately , Doro turned to Anyanwu . The moment his attention was focused on her , he knew she was still alive . He could sense it . She felt like prey , not like a useless corpse . Doro took her hand , then released it because it felt limp and dead . He touched her face , leaned down close to her ear . “
80613	80619	80607	80607	you	1866	” She gave no sign . “
80633	80655	80607	80607	you	1866	” Her eyes opened . She stared up at him for a second , perhaps reading his desperation on his face . “
80662	80688	80657	80657	I	0	" she whispered finally . He frowned wondering whether she too had gone out of her mind . But she was Isaac 's only hope . “
80691	80695	80657	80657	I	0	” he said . “
80718	80725	80657	80657	I	0	” She took a deep breath . “
80732	80747	80748	80748	She	1867	” He moved back from her and drew her toward Isaac with the rug . "
80752	80756	80748	80748	She	1867	” Anyanwu whispered . “
80762	80763	80757	80757	Her	1867	” "
80767	80774	80757	80757	Her	1867	” Doro said . Wild Seed 169 “
80837	80856	80829	80829	She	1867	” Yes . Nweke had been all Doro had hoped for and more . But she was dead . “
80862	80863	80829	80829	She	1867	” “
80869	80873	80829	80829	She	1867	” she said . “
80880	80881	80829	80829	She	1867	” “
80887	80888	80883	80883	you	61	” “
80893	81312	81313	81313	He	1868	” Trying to trust her , Doro left the room . Somehow , Anyanwu healed herself enough so that moving would not start her bleeding inside again . There was so much damage , and it had all been done so quickly , so savagely . When she changed her shape , she transformed organs that already existed and formed any necessary new organs while sustained by old ones . She was still partly human in most changes long after she had ceased to look human . But Nweke had all but destroyed organ after organ . If the girl had gone to work on her brain , Anyanwu knew she would have died before she could heal herself . Even now , there were massive repairs to be made and massive illnesses to be avoided . Even not touching her brain at all , Nweke had nearly killed her . How could she make herself fit now to help Isaac ? But she had to . She had known in the first year of their marriage that she had been wrong about him . He had been the best possible husband . With his power and hers , they had built this house . People came to watch them and watch for them so that no strangers happened by to see the witchcraft . Her strength had fascinated Isaac , but it had never disturbed him . His power she trusted absolutely . She had seen him carry great logs from the forest and strip them of bark . She had seen him kill wolves without touching them . In a fight once , she had seen him kill a man — a fool who had drunk too much and chosen to take offense at Isaac 's quiet , easy refusal to be insulted . The fool had a gun and Isaac did not . Isaac never went armed . There was no need . The man died as the wolves had died - instantly , his head broken and bloodied as though he had been bludgeoned . Afterward , Isaac himself was sickened by the killing . Anyanwu had seen these things , but none of them had made her fear her husband as she had feared Doro . Sometimes Isaac tossed her about and she screamed or laughed or swore at him- 170 Wild Seed whichever seemed right for the occasion — but she never feared him . And she never held him in contempt . “
81326	82332	81313	81313	He	1868	” she had told Doro when Isaac was young and she and Doro were on slightly better terms . In some ways , Isaac had more sense than Doro . And Isaac understood even better than she did that he would have to share her , at least with Doro . And she would have to share him with the women Doro gave to him . She was used to sharing a man , but she had had no experience in being shared . She did not like it . She grew to hate the sound of Doro 's voice identifying him , warning her that she must give him another child . Isaac accepted each of her children as though they were his own . He accepted her without bitterness or anger when she came to him from Doro 's bed . And somehow , he helped her to endure even when Doro strove to break and reshape her when her increasingly silent obedience ceased to be enough for him . Strangely , though she could not forgive Doro any longer even for small things , she felt no resentment when Isaac forgave him . The bond between Isaac and Doro was at least as firm as that between an ordinary father and a son of his body . If Isaac had not loved Doro , and if that love had not been returned strongly in Doro 's own way , Doro would have seemed totally inhuman . She did not want to think what her life would be like without Isaac - how she would endure Doro without Isaac . Not since her first husband had she allowed herself to become so dependent on anyone , husband or child . Other people were temporary . They died -except for Doro . Why , why could it not be Isaac who lived and lived , and Doro who died ? She kissed Isaac . She had given him many such kisses as he grew old . They were of more than love . Within her body , she synthesized medicine for him . She had studied him very carefully , had aged herself , her own organs to study the effects of age . It had been dangerous work . A miscalculation could have killed her before she understood it enough to counter it . She listened closely as Isaac described the pain he felt — the fearful tightening , the squeezing within his chest , the dizziness , the too - rapid beating of his heart , the way the pain spread from his chest to his left shoulder and arm . The first time he felt the pain — twenty years before he had thought he was dying . The first time she managed to induce such pain in her body , she too had feared she was dying . It was terrible , but she lived as Isaac had lived , and she came to understand how Wild Seed 171 old age and too much good , rich food could combine to steal away the youthful flexibility his blood vessels — especially , if her simulations had led her aright , the blood vessels that nourished his heart . What needed doing , then ? How could aging , fat - narrowed blood vessels be restored ? She could restore her own , of course . Since the pain had not killed her , and since she understood what she had done to produce the disorder , she could simply , carefully replace the damaged vessels , then dissolve away the useless hardened tissue , become the physiologically young woman she had been since the time of her transition . But transition had not frozen Isaac in youth . It had paid him other wages , good wages , but was useless in prolonging his life . If only she could give him some of her power ... That was pointless dreaming . If she could not heal the damage age and bad habits had caused , she could at least try to prevent further damage . He must not eat so much any longer , must not eat some foods at all . He must not smoke or work so hard — not with his muscles nor with his witch - power . Both took a physical toll . He would save no more ships from storms . Lighter tasks were all right as long as they did not bring on pain , but she told Doro very firmly that unless he wanted to kill Isaac , he would have to find a younger man for his heavy lifting and towing . That done , Anyanwu spent long painful hours trying to discover or create a medicine that would ease Isaac 's pain when it did come . In the end , she so tired and weakened herself that even Isaac begged her to stop . She did not stop . She poisoned herself several times trying plant and animal substances she had not used before , noting minutely her every reaction . She rechecked familiar substances , found that as simple a thing as garlic had some ability to help , but not enough . She worked on , gained knowledge that helped others later . For Isaac , she at last , almost accidentally created a potentially dangerous medicine that would open wide the healthy blood vessels he had left , thus relieving the pressure on his undernourished heart and easing the pain . When his pain came again , she gave him the medicine . The pain vanished and he was amazed . He took her into New York City and made her choose the finest cloth . Then he took her to a dressmaker — a black freedwoman who stared at her with open curiosity . Anyanwu began telling the woman what she wanted , but when she paused for breath , the dressmaker spoke up . “
82339	82356	82333	82333	You	1870	” she said in Anyanwu 's native language . And she smiled at Anyanwu 's surprise . “
82361	82536	82537	82537	Nweke	123	” 172 Wild Seed Anyanwu found herself greeting a countrywoman , perhaps a kinswoman . This was another gift Isaac was giving her . A new friend . He was good , Isaac . He could not die now and leave her . But this time , the medicine that had always worked seemed to be failing . Isaac gave no sign that his pain was ending . He lay ashen , sweating and gasping for breath . When she lifted her head from him , he opened his eyes . She did not know what to do . She wanted to look away from him , but could not . In her experimenting , she had found conditions of the heart that could kill very easily — and that could grow out of the problem he already had . She had almost killed herself learning about them . She had been so careful in her efforts to keep Isaac alive , and now , somehow , poor Nweke had undone all her work . “
82539	82550	82537	82537	Nweke	123	” Isaac whispered as though he had heard her thought . "
82556	82571	82551	82551	I	0	” Anyanwu said . She looked around , saw how the feather mattress billowed . “
82576	82577	82572	82572	She	123	” “
82580	82584	82585	82585	I	0	” he gasped . “
82595	82655	82592	82592	I	0	" He was dying ! Nweke had killed him . In her madness , she had killed him and he was worried that he might have hurt her ! Anyanwu shook her head , thought desperately . What could she do ? With all her vast knowledge , there must be something ... He managed to touch her hand . “
82662	82671	82656	82656	You	123	" he said . She began to cry . “
82693	82713	82678	82678	My	0	” His face twisted with pain . It was as though the pain knifed through Anyanwu 's own chest . "
82718	82722	82678	82678	My	0	” he said . “
82728	82735	82678	82678	My	0	” She obeyed still weeping silently . "
82746	82757	82741	82741	I	0	” he said . Somehow , she controlled her voice . “
82771	82772	82773	82773	You	61	” “
82777	82781	82773	82773	You	61	” he said . “
82790	82810	82788	82788	Doro	60	” The thought sickened her . She said nothing . With an effort , he spoke in her language . “
82826	83031	83032	83032	He	1875	” He said nothing more . There were only long moments of pain before he slipped into unconsciousness , then to death . CHAPTER 10 Anyanwu had gotten shakily to her feet when Doro arrived with a tray of food . She was standing beside the bed staring at the ruin of Nweke 's body . She did not seem to hear Doro when he put the tray down on a small table near her . He opened his mouth to ask her why she was not caring for Isaac , but the moment he thought of Isaac , his awareness told him Isaac was dead . His awareness had never failed him . In past years , he had prevented a number of people from being buried alive by the certainty of his ability . Yet now he knelt beside Isaac and felt at the neck for a pulse . Of course , there was none . Anyanwu turned and stared at him bleakly . She was young . In restoring her nearly destroyed body , she had returned to her true form . She looked like a girl mourning her grandfather and sister rather than a woman mourning her husband and daughter . “
83037	83041	83042	83042	He	1875	” she whispered . “
83055	83082	83050	83050	he	1875	” Doro glanced upward where Nweke 's body had left bloody smears on the ceiling . Anyanwu followed his gaze , then looked down again quickly . "
83092	83096	83083	83083	He	1875	” Doro said . “
83112	83113	83102	83102	she	1876	" "
83120	83127	83102	83102	she	1876	” She shook her head dazed . “
83132	83216	83102	83102	she	1876	" Surprisingly , she went to the food , took the tray out to the kitchen where she sat down and began to eat . He followed and watched her wonderingly . The damage Nweke had done her must have been even greater than he had thought if she could eat this way , tearing at the food like a starving woman while the bodies of those she loved most lay cooling in the next room . After a while , she said , “
83224	83432	83217	83217	Doro	60	” She was eating a sweet cake from the plate Isaac had put on the table for Doro . Doro felt hungry too , but could not bring himself to 174 Wild Seed touch food . Especially , not those cakes . He realized that it was not food he hungered for . He had only recently taken the body he was wearing . It was a good , strong body taken from his settlement in the colony of Pennsylvania . Ordinarily , it would have lasted him several months . He could have used it to sire Nweke 's first child . That would have been a fine match . There was stability and solid strength in his Pennsylvania settlers . Good stock . But stress , physical or emotional , took its toll , made him hunger when he should not have , made him long for the comfort of another change . He did not have to change . His present body would sustain him for a while longer . But he would feel hungry and uncomfortable until he changed . But he had no pressing reason to bear the discomfort . Nweke was dead ; Isaac was dead . He looked at Anyanwu . “
83440	83463	83464	83464	He	1880	” she repeated . Doro nodded . Let her have the ritual . She had been good to Isaac . Then afterward ... "
83472	83476	83464	83464	He	1880	” she said . “
83479	83480	83481	83481	Isaac	84	” "
83498	83502	83488	83488	he	1880	” Doro shrugged . “
83508	84277	83488	83488	he	1880	” She said nothing more . Arrangements were made for the funeral , the numerous married children notified . It did not matter whether they were Isaac 's children or Doro 's , they had grown up accepting Isaac as their father . And there were several foster children - those Anyanwu had taken in because their parents were unfit or dead . And there was everyone else . Everyone in town had known Isaac and liked him . Everyone would come now to show their respect . But on the day of the funeral , Anyanwu was nowhere to be found . To Doro 's tracking sense , it was as though she had ceased to exist . She flew as a large bird for a while . Then , far out at sea , she drifted down wearily to the water and took the long - remembered dolphin form . She had come down near where she saw a school of dolphins leaping through the water . They would accept her , surely , and she would become one of them . She would cause herself to grow until she was as large as most of them . She would learn to live in their world . It could be no more alien to her than the world she had just left . And perhaps when she learned their ways of comWild Seed 175 munication , she would find them too honorable or too innocent to tell lies and plot murder over the still warm corpses of their children . Briefly , she wondered how long she could endure being away from kinsmen , from friends , from any human beings . How long would she have to hide in the sea before Doro stopped hunting her or before he found her . She remembered her sudden panic when Doro took her from her people . She remembered the loneliness that Doro and Isaac and her two now - dead grandchildren had eased . How would she stand it alone among the dolphins ? How was it that she wanted to live so badly that even a life under the sea seemed precious ? Doro had reshaped her . She had submitted and submitted and submitted to keep him from killing her even though she had long ago ceased to believe what Isaac had told her — that her longevity made her the right mate for Doro . That she could somehow prevent him from becoming an animal . He was already an animal . But she had formed the habit of submission . In her love for Isaac and for her children , and in her fear of death — especially of the kind of death Doro would inflict - she had given in to him again and again . Habits were difficult to break . The habit of living , the habit of fear ... even the habit of love . Well . Her children were men and women now , able to care for themselves . She would miss them . No feeling was better than that of being surrounded by her own . Her children and grandchildren and great - grandchildren . She could never have been content moving constantly as Doro moved . It was her way to settle and make a tribe around her and stay within that tribe for as long as she could . Would it be possible , she wondered , to make a tribe of dolphins ? Would Doro give her the time she needed to try ? She had committed what was considered a great sin among his people : She had run away from him . It would not matter that she had done so to save her life that she could see he meant to kill her . After all her submission , he still meant to kill her . He believed it was his right to slaughter among his people as he chose . A great many of his people also believed this , and they did not run when he came for them . They were frightened , but he was their god . Running from him was useless . He invariably caught the runner and killed him or , very rarely , brought him home alive and chastened as proof to others that there was no escape . Also , to many , running was heretical . They believed that since he was their god , it was his right to do whatever he chose 176 Wild Seed with them . “
84279	86421	83488	83488	he	1880	” she called them in her thoughts . Like the Job of the Bible , they had made the best of their situation . They could not escape Doro , so they found virtue in submitting to him . Anyanwu found virtue in nothing that had to do with him . He had never been her god , and if she had to run for a century , never stopping long enough to build the tribes that brought her so much comfort , she would do it . He would not have her life . The people of Wheatley would see that he was not all - powerful . He would never show himself to them wearing her flesh . Perhaps others would notice his failure and see that he was no god . Perhaps they would run too -and how many could Doro chase ? Surely some would escape and be able to live their lives in peace with only ordinary human fears . The powerful ones like Isaac could escape . Perhaps even a few of her children ... She put away from her the memory that Isaac had never wanted to escape . Isaac was Isaac , set apart from other people and not to be judged . He had been the best of all her husbands , and she could not even attend his funeral rites . Thinking of him , longing for him , she wished she had kept her bird form longer , wished she had found some solitary place , some rocky island perhaps where she could mourn her husband and her daughter without fearing for her own life . Where she could think and remember and be alone . She needed time alone before she could be a fit companion for other creatures . But the dolphins had reached her . Several approached , chattering incomprehensibly , and for a moment , she thought they might attack her . But they only came to rub themselves against her and thus become acquainted . She swam with them and none of them molested her . She fed with them , snatching passing fish as hungrily as she had eaten the finest foods of Wheatley and of her homeland . She was a dolphin . If Doro had not found her an adequate mate , he would find her an adequate adversary . He would not enslave her again . And she would never be his prey . Book III Canaan 1840 CHAPTER 11 The old man had lived in Avoyelles Parish in the state of Louisiana for years , his neighbors told Doro . He had married daughters , but no sons . His wife was long dead and he lived alone on his plantation with his slaves — a number of whom were reputed to be his children . He kept to himself . He had never cared much for socializing , even when his wife was alive — nor had she . Warrick , the old man 's name was , Edward Warrick . Within the past century , he was the third human Doro had found himself drawn toward with the feeling that he was near Anyanwu . Anyanwu . He had not even said her name aloud for years . There was no one alive in the state of New York who had known her . Her children were dead . The grandchildren who had been born before she fled had also died . Wars had taken some of them . The War of Independence . The stupid 1812 War . The first had killed many of his people and sent others fleeing to Canada because they were too insular and apolitical for anyone 's taste . British soldiers considered them rebels and colonists considered them Tories . Many lost all their possessions as they fled to Canada , where Doro found them months later . Now Doro had a Canadian settlement as well as a reconstructed Wheatley in New York . Now , also , he had settlements in Brazil , in Mexico , in Kentucky , and elsewhere , scattered over the two large , empty continents . Most of his best people were now in the New World where there was room for them to grow and increase their power — where there was room for their strangeness . None of that was compensation for the near destruction of Wheatley , though , just as there could be no compensation for the loss in 1812 of several of his best people in Maryland . These Marylanders were the descendants of the people he had lost when he found Anyanwu . He had reassembled them painstakingly and got them breeding again . They had begun to show promise . Then sud- 180 Wild Seed denly the most promising ones were dead . He had had to bring in new blood to rebuild them for a third time - people as much like them as possible . That caused trouble because the people who proved to be most like them in ability were white . There was resentment and hatred on both sides and Doro had had to kill publicly a pair of the worst troublemakers to terrify the others back into their habit of obedience . More valuable breeders wasted . Trouble to settle with the surrounding whites who did not know quite what they had in their midst ... So much time wasted . There were years when he almost forgot Anyanwu . He would have killed her had he stumbled across her , of course . Occasionally , he had forgiven people who ran from him , people who were bright enough , strong enough to keep ahead of him for several days and give him a good hunt . But he forgave them only because once caught , they submitted . Not that they begged for their lives . Most did not . They simply ceased to struggle against him . They finally came to understand and acknowledge his power . They had first given him good entertainment , then , fully aware , they gave him themselves . When pardoned , they gave him a kind of loyalty , even friendship , equal to what he received from the best of his children . As with his children , after all , he had given them their lives . There had been times when he thought he might spare Anyanwu . There had even been moments when , to his amazement and disgust , he simply missed her , wished to see her again . Most often , however , he thought of her when he bred together her African and American descendants . He was striving to create a more stable , controlled Nweke , and he had had some success — people who could perceive and to some degree control the inner workings not only of their own bodies , but of the bodies of others . But their abilities were not de pendable . They brought agony as often as they brought relief . They killed as often as they healed . They could perform what ordinary doctors saw as miracles — or , as easily , as accidentally , what the most brutal slaveholder would see as atrocities . Also , they did not live long . Sometimes they made lethal mistakes within their own bodies and could not correct them in time . Sometimes relatives of their dead patients killed them . Sometimes they committed suicide . The better ones committed suicide - often after an especially ghastly failure . They needed Anyanwu 's control . Even now , if he could , Doro would have liked to breed her with some of them — let her give birth to superior human children for a change instead of the animal Wild Seed 181 young she must have borne over her years of freedom . But it was too late for that . She was spoiled . She had known too much freedom . Like most wild seed , she had been spoiled long before he met her . Now , finally , he went to complete the unfinished business of killing her and gathering up any new human descendants . He located her home - her plantation — by tracking her while she was in human form . It was not easy . She kept changing even though she did not seem to travel far . For days , he would have nothing to track . Then she turned human again and he could sense that she had not moved geographically . He closed in , constantly fearing that she would take bird or fish form and vanish for more years . But she stayed , drawing him across country to Mississippi , to Louisiana , to the parish of Avoyelles , then through pine woods and wide fields of cotton . When he reached the house that his senses told him concealed Anyanwu , he sat still on his horse for several minutes , staring at it from a distance . It was a large white frame house with tall , unnecessary columns and a porch with upper and lower galleries — a solid , permanent - looking place . He could see slave cabins extending out away from the house , almost hidden by trees . And there was a barn , a kitchen , and other buildings that Doro could not identify from a distance . He could see blacks moving around the grounds — children playing , a man chopping wood , a woman gathering something in the kitchen garden , another woman sweating over a steaming caldron of dirty clothes which she occasionally lifted on her stick . A boy with arms no longer than his forearms should have been was bending low here and there collecting trash with tiny hands . Doro looked long at this last slave . Was his deformity a result of some breeding project of Anyanwu 's ? Without quite knowing why he did it , Doro rode on . He had planned to take Anyanwu as soon as he found her — take her while she was off guard , still human and vulnerable . Instead , he went away , found lodging for the night at the cabin of one of Anyanwu 's poorer neighbors . That neighbor was a man , his wife , their four young children , and several thousand fleas . Doro spent a miserable , sleepless night , but over both supper and breakfast , he found the family a good source of information about its wealthy neighbor . It was from this man and woman that Doro learned of the married daughters , the bastard slave children , Mr. Warrick 's unneighborly 182 Wild Seed behavior — a great sin in the eyes of these people . And there was the dead wife , the frequent trips Warrick made to who knew where , and most strangely , that the Warrick property was haunted by what the local Acadians called a loup - garou — a werewolf . The creature appeared to be only a large black dog , but the man of the family , born and raised within a few miles of where he now lived , swore the same dog had been roaming that property since he was a boy . It had been known to disarm grown men , then stand over their rifles growling and daring them to take back what was theirs . Rumor had it that the dog had been shot several times — shot point - blank — but never felled . Never . Bullets passed through it as though through smoke . That was enough for Doro . For how many years had Anyanwu spent much of her time either away from home or in the form of a large dog . How long had it taken her to realize that he could not find her while she was an animal ? Most important , what would happen now if she had spotted him somehow , if she took animal form and escaped . He should have killed her at once ! Perhaps he could use hostages again — let his senses seek out those of her slaves who would make good prey . Perhaps he could force her back by threatening them . They would almost certainly be the best of her children . The next morning Doro headed his black gelding up the pathway to Anyanwu 's mansion . As he reached it an adolescent boy came to take his horse . It was the boy with the deformed arms . “
86428	86432	83488	83488	he	1880	” Doro asked . “
86437	86453	86435	86435	sir	1884	” said the boy softly . Doro laid a hand on the boy 's shoulder . "
86471	86586	86468	86469	your master	1882	” He had not expected to make such a quick decision , but the boy was perfect for what he wanted . Despite his deformity , he was highly desirable prey . No doubt Anyanwu treasured him - a beloved son . The boy looked at Doro , unafraid , then started toward the house . Doro kept a grip on his shoulder , though he did not doubt that the boy could have gotten away easily . Doro was wearing the body of a short , slight Frenchman while the boy was well - muscled , powerfullooking in spite of his own short stature . All Anyanwu 's children tended to be short . "
86593	86609	86468	86469	your master	1882	” Doro asked . The boy glanced at him , then at the foreshortened arms . "
86614	86619	86620	86620	I	0	” he said softly . “
86648	86661	86639	86639	'em	1889	” Doro did not like his slave patois . It sounded false . “
86664	86688	86689	86689	I	0	" Doro frowned at the tiny child 's arms on the young man 's body . No accident could cause such a deformity . "
86700	86701	86689	86689	I	0	” “
86718	86719	86706	86706	I	0	” “
86729	86734	86740	86740	massa	1887	” Doro demanded exasperated . “
86764	86824	86826	86826	you	1886	” Doro jerked the boy around to face him , and the boy smiled . For a moment , Doro wondered whether he was demented — as warped of mind as he was of body . But the eyes were intelligent - even mocking now . It seemed that the boy was perfectly intelligent , and laughing at him . “
86840	86886	86826	86826	you	1886	” The boy shook his head , straightened so that he met Doro 's eyes levelly . There was nothing of the slave in his gaze . When he spoke again , he ceased to make even his minimal effort to sound like a slave . "
86895	86899	86826	86826	you	1886	" he said . “
86938	86958	86901	86901	I	0	” . There was no point in asking who had told him . Somehow , Anyanwu had spotted him . “
86964	86970	86962	86962	you	1886	” he asked the boy . "
86973	86974	86962	86962	you	1886	” “
86982	86983	86978	86978	you	1886	” “
86986	86987	86978	86978	you	1886	” “
86993	86994	86996	86996	myself	0	” "
87017	87018	87010	87010	I	0	” “
87022	87023	87010	87010	I	0	” "
87037	87038	87041	87041	he	3227	” “
87044	87045	87041	87041	he	3227	” "
87065	87066	87055	87055	she	1895	” “
87070	87071	87068	87068	you	1886	” "
87074	87116	87068	87068	you	1886	” what I can do f living out the day . him . Somehow , 184 Wild Seed Doro shook his head . Anyanwu had come almost as near to success as he had — and with far less raw material . “
87122	87126	87068	87068	you	1886	” he said . “
87131	87198	87127	87127	She	1895	" the boy said . Startled , Doro looked around , searching for Anyanwu , knowing she must be in animal form since he had not sensed her . She stood perhaps ten paces behind him near a yellow pine sapling . She was a large , sharp - faced black dog , standing statue - still , watching him . He spoke to her impatiently . "
87213	87388	87199	87199	I	0	” She began to change . She took her time about it , but he did not complain . He had waited too long for a few minutes to matter . Finally , human , female , and unself - consciously naked , she walked past him onto the porch . In that moment , he meant to kill her . If she had taken any other form , become anyone other than her true self , she would have died . But she was now as she had been over a hundred and fifty years — a century and a half — before . She was the same woman he had shared a clay couch with thousands of miles away , lifetimes ago . He raised his hand toward her . She did not see it . He could have taken her then and there without further trouble . But he lowered the hand before it touched her smooth , dark shoulder . He stared at her , angry with himself , frowning . "
87396	87469	87394	87394	Doro	60	" she said . Her voice was the same , soft and young . He followed her in feeling oddly confused , suspended in time , with only the watchful , protective young son to jar him to reality . He looked at the son , ragged and shoeless and dusty . The boy should have seemed out of place inside the handsomely furnished home , but somehow , he did not . “
87475	87488	87394	87394	Doro	60	" he said , catching Doro 's arm in his childsized hands . “
87501	87619	87496	87496	She	1900	” Doro did not doubt that she would . Apparently , the boy understood his role as hostage . Doro sat down in an upholstered armchair and the boy sat opposite him on a sofa . Between them was a small wooden table and a fireplace of carved black stone . There was a large oriental rug on the floor and several other chairs and tables scattered around the room . A maid in a plain clean blue dress and white apron brought brandy and looked at the boy as though daring him to have any . He smiled and did not . Wild Seed 185 The maid would have been good prey too . A daughter ? “
87625	87633	87622	87622	she	1900	” Doro asked when she was gone . "
87639	87644	87622	87622	she	1900	” the boy said . “
87651	87652	87646	87646	she	1900	” "
87667	87740	87622	87622	she	1900	” A latent then . One who could pass her heritage on to her children , but could not use it herself . She should be bred to a near relative . Doro wondered whether Anyanwu had overcome her squeamishness enough to do this . Was that where this boy who was growing arms had come from ? Inbreeding ? Was his father , perhaps , one of Anyanwu 's older sons ? “
87748	87754	87743	87743	you	1902	” he asked the boy . "
87769	87774	87775	87775	She	1903	” The boy shrugged . “
87805	87806	87807	87807	She	1903	" “
87813	87814	87807	87807	She	1903	” “
87830	88369	87820	87820	She	1903	" In her bedroom , Anyanwu dressed quickly and casually as a man . She kept her body womanly — she wanted to be herself when she faced Doro — but after the easy unclothed freedom of the dog body , she could not have stood the layers of tight clothing women were expected to wear . The male clothing accented her womanliness anyway . No one had ever seen her this way and mistaken her for a man or boy . Abruptly , she threw her shirt to the floor and stood , head in hands , before her dressing table . Doro would break Stephen into pieces if she ran now . He would probably not kill him , but he would make him a slave . There were people here in Louisiana and in the other Southern states who bred people as Doro did . They gave a man one woman after another and when the children came , the man had no authority over what was done to them , no responsibility to them or to their mothers . Authority and responsibility were the prerogatives of the masters . Doro would do that to her son , make him no more than a breeding animal . She thought of the sons and daughters she had left behind in Doro 's hands . It was not likely that any of them were alive now , but she had no doubt of the way Doro had used them while they did live . She could not have helped them . It was all she had been able to do to get Doro to give his word not to 186 Wild Seed harm them during her marriage to Isaac . Beyond that , she could have stayed with them and died , but she could not have helped them . And growing up as they had in Wheatley , they would not have wanted her help . Doro seduced people . He made them want to please him , made them strive for his approval . He terrified them into submission only when he could not seduce them . And when he could not terrify them .... What could she do ? She could not run again and leave him Stephen and the others . But she was no more able to help them by staying than she had been able to help her children in Wheatley . She could not even help herself . What would he do to her when she went downstairs ? She had run away from him , and he murdered runaways . Had he allowed her to dress herself merely so that he would not have the inconvenience of taking over a naked body ? What could she do ? Doro and Stephen were talking like old friends when Anyanwu walked into the parlor . To her surprise , Doro stood up . He had always seemed lazily unconcerned with such courtesies before . She sat with Stephen on the sofa , noticing automatically that the boy 's arms seemed to be forming well . He had been so good , so controlled on that terrible day when he lost them . “
88377	88390	88373	88373	your	1908	” she told him softly . He looked at her , surprised . “
88393	88397	88398	88398	I	0	” she repeated . "
88403	88437	88398	88398	I	0	” Clearly , that was what was concerning him . She had told him a great deal about Doro . He did not want to leave her , but finally , he obeyed . “
88441	88448	88438	88439	Good boy	1910	” Doro commented , sipping brandy . “
88451	88460	88438	88439	Good boy	1910	” she agreed . He shook his head . “
88477	88499	88472	88472	I	0	” She said nothing . When had it ever mattered what she said to him ? He did as he pleased . "
88509	88513	88500	88500	You	61	” he said . “
88524	88525	88522	88522	himself	3025	” "
88534	88538	88539	88539	I	0	” she said . "

88548	88549	88541	88541	his	1910	” “
88555	88587	88588	88588	His	1910	” She hesitated . He would ask , of course . He would inquire after the Wild Seed 187 ancestry of her children as though after the bloodline of a horse . “
88596	88600	88601	88601	He	2968	” she said . "
88623	88624	88613	88613	He	1910	” “
88635	88636	88626	88626	he	1910	" “

88751	88918	88737	88737	They	2793	” he said amiably . He was being surprisingly amiable . He was at his first stage seeking to seduce her as he had when he took her from her people . No doubt by his own reasoning he was being extremely generous . She had run from him , done what no one else could do , kept out of his hands for more than a lifetime ; yet instead of killing her at once , he seemed to be beginning again with her - giving her a chance to accept him as though nothing had happened . That meant he wanted her alive , if she would submit . Her own sense of relief at this realization startled her . She had come down the stairs to him expecting to die , ready to die , and here he was courting her again . And here she was responding . . . . No . Not again . No more Wheatleys . What then ? “
88936	88940	88929	88929	he	1923	” Doro said . “

89423	89458	89459	89459	He	497	” Did he really think she would have stayed to meet him , kept her children here so that he could threaten them ? Did he think she had grown stupid with the years ? “
89472	89476	89459	89459	He	497	” she continued . “
89500	89501	89502	89502	He	497	” “
89506	89513	89502	89502	He	497	” Doro said . She shrugged . “

89529	89540	89520	89520	Anyanwu	61	” She hesitated , spoke her hope in a whisper . “
89555	89584	89520	89520	Anyanwu	61	” She looked up , saw that Doro was watching her intently . There was a kind of hunger in his expression - hunger that he masked quickly . “
89592	89600	89586	89586	he	497	” he asked , neutral - voiced . “
89688	89689	89674	89674	He	143	” "
89696	89700	89674	89674	He	143	” Doro said . “

89734	89802	89728	89728	I	0	” There was a long silence . Something was coming , and it had to do with Stephen , Anyanwu knew . She wanted to ask what it was , but then Doro would tell her and she would have to find some way to defy him . When she did . . . when she did , she would fail , and he would kill her . “
89813	89862	89808	89808	Isaac	84	” she whispered . Would he hear that as what it was — a plea for mercy ? He stared at her as though she had said something incomprehensible , as though he was trying to understand . Finally , he smiled a small , uncharacteristically tentative smile . “
89887	89911	89864	89864	you	143	” She shrugged . Nonsense . He was talking nonsense while she waited to hear what he meant to do to her son ! “

89982	90017	89978	89978	You	61	” she said . He got up and went to sit beside her on the sofa . Somehow , she kept still , subdued her impulse to get up , move away from him . “
90023	90040	90018	90018	I	0	” he said . She stared past him at one of the candlesticks on the mantel . “

90056	90102	90104	90104	you	61	" He was silenced . She faced him , looked into eyes that were large and wide - set and brown . He had the eyes of a larger man - or his current body did . They gave him a false expression of gentleness . "

90269	90297	90264	90264	you	61	” she had asked once , trying to understand . She cared about each one of her children , raised each one she bore and loved it . “

The girl , understanding what was to happen to her , had still somehow treated him as a lover . It was obscene . "

He had told her what he Wild Seed 191 wanted and let her know what he would do to her or to her children if she did not obey . Was he bargaining now , then , or was he playing with her ? What could she lose by assuming that he was serious ? “

91097	91124	91094	91095	your wife	1779	” he asked . She wanted to shake him . She wanted to use her strength , make him tell her what he meant to do . “

93133	93661	93127	93127	You	0	” she told him quietly , and she walked into the hall , through the house , and out the back door . From there , through the trees she could see the bayou with its slow water . Nearer were the dependencies and the slave cabins that were not inhabited by slaves . She owned no slaves . She had bought some of the people who worked for her and recruited the others among freedmen , but those she bought , she freed . They always stayed to work for her , feeling more comfortable with her and with each other than they had ever been elsewhere . That always surprised the new ones . They were not used to being comfortable with other people . 196 Wild Seed They were misfits , malcontents , troublemakers — though they did not make trouble for Anyanwu . They treated her as mother , older sister , teacher , and , when she invited it , lover . Somehow , even this last intimacy did nothing to diminish her authority . They knew her power . She was who she was , no matter what role she chose . And yet , she did not threaten them , did not slaughter among them as Doro did among his people . The worst she did was occasionally fire someone . Firing meant eviction . It meant leaving the safety and comfort of the plantation and becoming a misfit again in the world outside . It meant exile . Few of them knew how difficult it was for Anyanwu to turn one of them out - or worse , turn a family out . Few of them knew how their presence comforted her . She was not Doro , breeding people as though they were cattle , though perhaps her gathering of all these special ones , these slightly strange ones would accomplish the same purpose as his breeding . She was herself , gathering family . No doubt some of these people were of her family , her descendants . They felt like her children . Perhaps , there had been intermarriage , her descendants drawn together by a comforting but indefinable similarity and not knowing of their common origins . And there were other people probably not related to her , who had rudimentary sensitivity that could become true thought reading in a few generations . Mgbada had told her this — that she was gathering people who were like his grandparents . He had told her she was breeding witches . An old woman came up to her — a white woman , withered and gray , Luisa , who did what sewing she could for her keep . She was one of five white people on the place . There could have been many more whites , fitting in very comfortably , but the race - conscious culture made that dangerous . The four younger whites tried to lessen the danger by telling people they were octoroons . Luisa was a Creole -a French - Spanish mixture — and too old to care who knew it . “
93666	93673	93674	93674	Stephen	143	” Luisa asked . Anyanwu nodded . “
93689	93690	93680	93680	Doro	60	" “
93710	93717	93706	93706	them	3040	” Luisa stared hard at her . “
93726	93727	93720	93720	he	2125	” “
93774	93871	93769	93769	they	3040	” If Doro killed her , he would not be able to use her healing or metamorphosing abilities . She had learned that from her stay in Wheatley . He could possess someone 's body and use it to have children , but he could use only the body . When he possessed Thomas so long ago , he had not gained Thomas ' thought - reading ability . She had never known him to use any extra ability from a body he possessed . The old woman took Anyanwu by the shoulders and hugged her . “
93877	93881	93874	93874	you	2130	” she asked . "
93887	93888	93874	93874	you	2130	” “
93899	93900	93895	93895	I	0	” “
93903	93999	94000	94000	I	0	” Anyanwu told her . Luisa hurried across the grass . She moved well for her age . Like Anyanwu 's children , she had lived a long , healthy life . Cholera , malaria , yellow fever , typhus , and other diseases swept across the land and left Anyanwu 's people almost untouched . If they caught a disease , they survived it and recovered quickly . If they hurt themselves , Anyanwu was there to care for them . As Luisa disappeared into the trees , Doro came out of the house . “
94006	94010	94000	94000	I	0	” he said . “
94022	94030	94013	94013	you	0	" Anyanwu turned to face him angrily . "
94059	94060	94041	94041	You	0	" “
94074	94124	94062	94062	you	0	” There was an edge to his voice finally . She was beginning to irritate him and end the seductive phase . That was good . How stupid of him to think she could be seduced again . It was possible , however , that she might seduce him . “
94137	94141	94135	94135	you	0	” she said . “

94165	94169	94170	94170	Isaac	84	" She shrugged . “
94174	94300	94170	94170	Isaac	84	” Silence . She knew Isaac had spoken to him several times . Isaac had wanted them together so badly — the two people he loved best . Did that mean anything at all to Doro ? It had not years before , but now ... Doro had been glad to see her . He had marveled over the fact that she seemed unchanged — as though he was only now beginning to realize that she was only slightly more likely to die than he 198 Wild Seed was , and not likely at all to grow decrepit with age . As though her immortality had been emotionally unreal to him until now , a fact that he had accepted with only half his mind . “

94710	94888	94688	94688	They	2159	” To her surprise , he hugged her very much as Luisa had , and he laughed . He took her arm and walked her over to the slave quarters , still laughing . He quieted though as he pushed open a random door and peered into one of the neat , sturdy cabins . There was a large brick fireplace with a bake kettle down amid the nearly dead coals . Wild Seed 199 Someone 's supper bread . There was a large bed in one corner and a trundle bed beneath . There were a table and four chairs all of which looked homemade , but adequate . There was a cradle that also looked homemade — and much used . There were a wood box and a water bucket with its gourd dipper . There were bunches of herbs and ears of corn hung from the ceiling to dry and cooking utensils over and alongside the fireplace . Overall , the cabin gave the impression of being a plain but comfortable place to live . “
94893	94897	94688	94688	They	2159	” Anyanwu asked . “

95627	96047	95623	95623	I	0	” He was making a new Wheatley . He had settlements everywhere , families everywhere . She had only one , and he was taking it . He had taken her from one people and driven her from another , and now , he was casually reaching out to strip her of a third . And she was wrong . She could live on and on and have nothing . She would . He would see to it . CHAPTER 12 Anyanwu had never watched a group like her own break apart . She did not know whether there had ever before been a group like her own . Certainly , once Doro began to spend time at the plantation , exercising his authority as he chose while Anyanwu stood by and said nothing , the character of the group began to change . When he brought Joseph Toler as husband for one of Anyanwu 's daughters , the young man changed the group more by refusing to do work of any kind . His foster parents had pampered him , allowed him to spend his time drinking and gambling and bedding young women . But he was a beautiful young man — honey - colored with curly black hair , tall and slender . Anyanwu 's daughter Margaret Nneka was fascinated by him . She accepted him very quickly . Few other people on the plantation accepted him at all . He was not doing his share of the work , yet he could not be fired and sent away . He could , however , make a great deal of trouble . He had been on the plantation for only a few weeks when he went too far and lost a fist fight with Anyanwu 's son Stephen . Anyanwu was alone when Stephen came to tell her what had happened . She had just come from treating a four - year - old who had wandered down to the bayou and surprised a water moccasin . She had been able to manufacture within her own body a medicine to counter the poison easily , since one of the first things she had done on settling in Louisiana was allow herself to be bitten by such a snake . By now , countering the poison was almost second nature to her . She did like to have a meal afterward , though ; thus Stephen , bruised and disheveled , found her in the dining room eating . “
96061	96079	96055	96059	that lazy , worthless bastard	2182	” he said . Anyanwu sighed . There was no need to ask who the boy meant . “
96085	96086	96082	96082	he	2182	” “
96092	96119	96120	96120	He	2182	” Anyanwu dropped the piece of cornbread she had been about to 202 Wild Seed bite . Helen was her youngest daughter - eleven years old . "
96123	96124	96120	96120	He	2182	” "
96140	96150	96133	96133	He	2182	” has Stephen and si Anyanwu 's strenis tender , "
96156	96157	96152	96152	she	90	” “
96166	96171	96160	96160	She	90	” Anyanwu stood up . "
96187	96188	96185	96185	he	2182	” “
96197	96438	96185	96185	he	2182	” She went out , not knowing whether she was going to give the young man another beating or help him if Stephen had hurt him seriously . But what kind of animal was he to try to rape a child ? How could Anyanwu possibly tolerate him here after this ? Doro would have to take him away , breeding be damned . The young man was not beautiful when Anyanwu found him . He was half again as large as Stephen and strong in spite of his indolence , but Stephen had inherited much of Anyanwu 's strength . And he knew how to administer a good beating , even with his tender , newly finished arms and hands . The young man 's face was a lumpy mass of bruised tissue . His nose was broken and bleeding . The flesh around his eyes was grotesquely swollen . The left ear was torn nearly off . He would lose it and look like one of the slaves marked and sold South for running away . His body was so bruised beneath his shirt that Anyanwu was certain he had broken ribs . And he was lacking several of his front teeth . He would never be beautiful again . He began to come to as Anyanwu was probing at his ribs . He grunted , cursed , coughed , and with the cough , twisted in agony . "
96442	96446	96491	96491	I	0	” Anyanwu said . “
96458	96464	96491	96491	I	0	” The young man whimpered . “
96471	96475	96467	96467	Stephen	143	” she said . “
96503	96522	96491	96491	I	0	” In spite of his pain , the young man cringed away from her , clutching himself protectively . “
96534	96558	96491	96491	I	0	" she asked in disgust . She made him stand up , ignoring his weakness , his Wild Seed 203 moans of pain . “
96565	96569	96491	96491	I	0	” she said . “
96581	96718	96491	96491	I	0	" He made it into the house , did not pass out until he reached the stairs . Anyanwu carried him up to a small , hot attic bedroom , washed him , bandaged his ribs , and left him there with water , bread , and a little fruit . She could have given him something to ease his pain , but she did not . The little girl , Helen , lay asleep on her bed still wearing her torn dress . Her face was swollen on one side as though from a heavy blow , and the sight of it made Anyanwu want to give the young man another beating . Instead , she woke the child gently . In spite of her gentleness , Helen awoke with a start and cried out . “
96723	96728	96719	96719	You	2192	” Anyanwu told her . “
96733	96753	96729	96729	I	0	" The child clung to her , not weeping , only holding tightly , holding with all her strength . “
96758	96762	96764	96764	he	2193	” Anyanwu asked . “
96768	96775	96764	96764	he	2193	” The girl did not respond . “
96782	96795	96796	96796	He	2193	” The girl lay down again slowly and looked up at her . “
96802	96806	96796	96796	He	2193	” she said . “
96814	96815	96810	96810	him	2193	" “
96821	96822	96810	96810	him	2193	” "
96845	96846	96847	96847	He	2193	" "
96852	96853	96847	96847	He	2193	” “
96859	96908	96847	96847	He	2193	” Finally , the child began to cry . She pulled her pillow around her swollen face and wept into it . Anyanwu rubbed her shoulders and her neck and let her cry . She did not think the girl was crying because she had nearly been raped . "
96911	97037	96909	96909	Obiageli	153	” she whispered . Before the girl 's birth , a childless white woman named Helen Matthews had asked Anyanwu to give a child her name . Anyanwu had never liked the name Helen , but the white woman had been a good friend - one of those who had overcome her own upbringing and her neighbors ' noisy mouths and come to live on the plantation . She had never been able to have children , had been past the age of bearing when she met Anyanwu . Thus , Anyanwu 's youngest daughter was named Helen . And Helen was the daughter Anyanwu most often called by her second name , Obiageli . Somehow , she had lost that custom with the others . “
97047	97084	97044	97044	he	2195	” 204 Wild Seed After a while , the girl sniffed , turned over , and wiped her face . She lay still , staring up at the ceiling , one small frown between her eyes . "
97090	97094	97085	97085	I	0	” she said . “
97101	97120	97121	97121	She	156	” This was the os rouge cook — a woman of black and Indian ancestry and Spanish appearance . “
97163	97164	97152	97152	He	2195	” “
97174	97178	97165	97165	I	0	” muttered Anyanwu . “
97195	97196	97197	97197	I	0	” “
97207	97212	97197	97197	I	0	” the girl continued . “
97274	97282	97283	97283	I	0	” She stopped , looked at Anyanwu . “
97294	97295	97287	97287	Stephen	143	” "
97302	97306	97307	97307	He	143	” Anyanwu said . “
97315	97316	97317	97317	He	143	" “
97322	97323	97317	97317	He	143	” "
97326	97334	97317	97317	He	143	" Eyes downcast , the girl continued . “
97411	97416	97407	97407	Stephen	143	” She looked up . “
97422	97423	97418	97418	Stephen	143	" "
97426	97508	97509	97509	Stephen	143	" Anyanwu shuddered , not wanting to think of what Doro might have done to Stephen if Stephen had killed the worthless Joseph . If there had to be killing , she must do it . Probably no one on the plantation disliked killing more than she did , but she had to protect her people from both Doro 's malicious strangers and Doro himself . Still , she hoped Joseph would behave himself until Doro returned and took him away . “
97515	97520	97509	97509	Stephen	143	” Helen said softly . “
97539	97619	97533	97533	he	143	" She shook her head , her child 's face hard and old . Anyanwu took her hand , remembering - remembering Lale , her Isaac 's unlikely , unworthy brother . In all her time with Doro , she had not met another of his people as determinedly vicious as Lale . Wild Seed 205 Until now , perhaps . Why had Doro given her such a man ? And why had he not at least warned her ? “
97627	97632	97622	97622	you	2199	” the girl asked . "
97639	97640	97634	97634	Doro	60	” “
97652	97819	97642	97642	Doro	60	” Anyanwu winced . Just because you say so ... How long had things been going on on the plantation just because she said so ? People had been content with what she said . If they had problems they could not solve , they came to her . If they quarreled and could not settle matters themselves , they came to her . She had never invited them to come to her with their troubles , but she had never turned them away either . They had made her their final authority . Now her eleven - year - old daughter wanted to know if a thing would happen just because she said so . Her eleven - year - old ! It had taken time , patience , and at least some wisdom to build the people 's confidence in her . It took only a few weeks of Doro 's presence to erode that confidence so badly that even her children doubted her . “
97826	97831	97821	97821	Doro	60	” the girl persisted . “
97834	97839	97821	97821	Doro	60	” Anyanwu said quietly . “
97846	98243	98244	98244	grandmother	2201	” That night , Stephen walked in his sleep for the first time in his life . He walked out onto the upper gallery of the porch and fell or jumped off . There was no disturbance ; Stephen did not cry out . At dawn , old Luisa found him sprawled on the ground , his neck so twisted that Luisa was not surprised to find his body cold . The old woman climbed the stairs herself to wake Anyanwu and take her to an upstairs sitting room away from the young daughter who was sleeping with her . The daughter , Helen , slept on , content , moving over a little into the warm place Anyanwu had left . In the sitting room , Luisa stood hesitant , silent before Anyanwu , longing for a way to ease the terrible news . Anyanwu did not know how she was loved , Luisa thought . She gathered people to her and cared for them and helped them care for each other . Luisa had a sensitivity that had made closeness with other people a torture to her for most of her life . Somehow , she had endured a childhood and adolescence on a true plantation , where the ordinary accepted cruelties of slaveholder to slave drove her away into a marriage that she should not have made . People thought she was merely kind and womanishly unrealistic to be in such sympathy with slaves . They did 206 Wild Seed not understand that far too much of the time , she literally felt what the slaves felt , shared fragments of their meager pleasure and far too many fragments of their pain . She had had none of Stephen 's control , had never completed the agonizing change that she knew had come to the young man two years before . The man - thing called Doro had told her this was because her ancestry was wrong . He said she was descended from his people . It was his fault then that she had lived her life knowing of her husband 's contempt and her children 's indifference . It was his fault that she had been sixty years old before she found people whose presence she could endure without pain — people she could love and be loved by . She was "
98245	98354	98426	98426	Luisa	150	” to all the children here . Some of them actually lived in her cabin because their parents could not or would not care for them . Luisa thought some parents were too sensitive to any negative or rebellious feelings in their children . Anyanwu thought it was more than that — that some people did not want any children around them , rebellious or not . She said some of Doro 's people were that way . Anyanwu took in stray children herself — as well as stray adults . Her son had shown signs of becoming much like her . Now , that son was dead . “
98359	98364	98426	98426	Luisa	150	” Anyanwu asked her . “
98369	98370	98426	98426	Luisa	150	” “
98374	98383	98386	98386	Joseph	151	” Luisa said , longing to spare her . "
98388	98389	98390	98390	Joseph	151	” "
98392	98409	98390	98390	Joseph	151	” That son of a whore Doro had brought to marry one of Anyanwu 's daughters . “
98418	98419	98416	98416	Joseph	151	” “
98428	98437	98426	98426	Luisa	150	” The old woman took a deep breath . “
98441	98445	98438	98438	Your	150	” she said . “
98450	98487	98446	98446	Stephen	143	” There was a long , terrible silence . Anyanwu sat frozen , stunned . Luisa wished she would wail with a mother 's grief so that Luisa could comfort her . But Anyanwu never wailed . “
98493	98497	98498	98498	He	143	” Anyanwu whispered . “
98512	98513	98514	98514	I	0	" “
98525	98526	98519	98519	He	143	” "
98530	98531	98519	98519	He	143	” “
98538	98539	98519	98519	He	143	” “
98545	98546	98519	98519	He	143	” “
98573	98574	98564	98564	I	0	" "
98578	98839	98840	98840	She	2207	” Wild Seed 207 She would have gone down in her gown , but Luisa seized a cloak from her bedroom and wrapped her in it . She noticed as she left with Anyanwu that the little girl was moving restlessly in her sleep , moaning softly . A nightmare ? Outside , others had discovered Stephen 's body . Two children stood back , staring at him wide - eyed , and a woman knelt beside him wailing as Anyanwu would not . The woman was Iye , a tall , handsome , solemn woman of utterly confused ancestry - French and African , Spanish and Indian . The mixture blended all too well in her . Luisa knew her to have thirtysix years , but she could have passed easily for a woman of twentysix or even younger . The children were her son and daughter and the one in her belly would be Stephen 's son or daughter . She had married a husband who loved wine better than he could love any woman , and wine had finally killed him . Anyanwu had found her destitute with her two babies , selling herself to get food for them , and considering very seriously whether she should take her husband 's rusty knife and cut their throats and then her own . Anyanwu had given her a home and hope . Stephen , when he was old enough , had given her something more . Luisa could remember Anyanwu shaking her head over the match , saying , “
98864	98870	98858	98858	she	2207	” And Luisa had laughed . “
98894	98895	98896	98896	I	0	” "
98902	98908	98896	98896	I	0	” Anyanwu had been indignant . “
98924	98940	98913	98913	You	0	” And Anyanwu , being Anyanwu , had gone from angry silence to easy laughter . “
98955	98959	98943	98943	he	2208	” she said . “
98970	98974	98962	98962	he	2208	" Luisa countered . “
99037	99127	99128	99128	We	2214	” Anyanwu had ignored this , preferring to believe that eventually her son would make a suitable marriage . Even now , Luisa did not know whether Anyanwu knew of the child coming . There was noth- 208 Wild Seed ing showing yet , but Iye had told Luisa . She would not have told Anyanwu . Now , Anyanwu went to the body , bent to touch the cold flesh of the throat . Iye saw her and started to move away , but Anyanwu caught her hand . “
99132	99309	99128	99128	We	2214	” she said softly . Iye hid her face and continued to weep . It was her youngest child , a boy of eight years , whose scream stopped both her crying and Anyanwu 's more silent grief . At the boy 's cry , everyone looked at him , then upward at the gallery where he was looking . There , Helen was slowly climbing over the railing . Instantly , Anyanwu moved . Luisa had never seen a human being move that quickly . When Helen jumped , Anyanwu was in position beneath her . Anyanwu caught her in careful , cushioning fashion , so that even though the girl had dived off the railing head first , her head did not strike the ground . Neither her head nor her neck were injured . She was almost as large as Anyanwu , but Anyanwu was clearly not troubled by her size or weight . By the time Luisa realized what was happening , it was over . Anyanwu was calming her weeping daughter . “
99316	99320	99312	99312	she	2215	” Luisa asked . “
99325	99336	99312	99312	she	2215	” Anyanwu shook her head , clearly frightened , bewildered . "
99341	99347	99348	99348	He	151	” Helen said at last . “
99363	99386	99387	99387	Obiageli	153	” She looked up at the gallery , then at her mother who still held her . She began to cry again . "
99389	99393	99387	99387	Obiageli	153	” Anyanwu said . “
99410	99464	99402	99402	I	0	” . But the child clung to Anyanwu and screamed when Luisa tried to pry her loose . Anyanwu could have pried her loose easily , but she chose to spend a few moments more comforting her . When Helen was calmer , it was Iye , not Luisa , who took her . "
99470	99474	99468	99468	you	0	” Anyanwu said . “
99490	99491	99487	99487	anyone	2749	” “
99497	99630	99494	99494	you	0	” Iye asked . Anyanwu did not answer . Her body had already begun to change . She threw off her cloak and her gown . By the time she was naked , her body was clearly no longer human . She was changing very quickly , becoming a great cat this time instead of the familiar large dog . A great spotted cat . When the change was complete , she went to the door , and Luisa Wild Seed 209 opened it for her . Luisa started to follow her in . There would be at least one other door that needed opening , after all . But the cat turned and uttered a loud coughing cry . It barred Luisa 's path until she turned and went outside again . “
99634	99641	99494	99494	you	0	” whispered Iye as Luisa returned . "
99660	99684	99649	99649	she	2220	” Luisa ignored her , went to Stephen and straightened his neck and body , then covered him with Anyanwu 's discarded cloak . “
99692	99696	99687	99687	she	2220	” Iye asked . “
99700	99705	99698	99698	Joseph	151	” Helen said quietly . “
99708	99718	99698	99698	Joseph	151	” Iye stared uncomprehending into the small solemn face . “
99721	99726	99698	99698	Joseph	151	” the child said . “
99741	100396	99735	99735	he	60	” In leopard form , Anyanwu padded down the hall and up the main stairs , then up the narrower stairs to the attic . She was hungry . She had changed a little too quickly , and she knew she would have to eat soon . She would control herself , though ; she would eat none of Joseph 's disgusting flesh . Better to eat stinking meat crawling with maggots ! How could even Doro have brought her human vermin like Joseph ? His door was shut , but Anyanwu opened it with a single blow of her paw . There was a hoarse sound of surprise from inside . Then , as she bounded into the room , something plucked at her forelegs , and she went sliding on chin and chest to jam her face against his washstand . It hurt , but she could ignore the pain . What she could not ignore was the fear . She had hoped to surprise him , catch him before he could use his ability . She had even hoped that he could not stop her while she was in a nonhuman form . Now , she gave her tearing , coughing roar of anger and of fear that she might fail . For an instant , her legs were free . Perhaps she had frightened him into losing control . It did not matter . She leaped , claws extended , as though to the back of a running deer . Joseph screamed and threw his arms up to shield his throat . At the same moment , he controlled her legs again . He was inhumanly quick in his desperation . Anyanwu knew that because she was inhumanly quick all the time . Sensation left her legs , and she almost toppled off him . She seized a hold with her teeth , sinking them into one of his arms , tearing away flesh , meaning to get at the throat . 210 Wild Seed Feeling returned to her legs , but suddenly she could not breathe . Her throat felt closed , blocked somehow . Instantly , she located the blockage , opened a place beneath it — a hole in her throat through which to breathe . And she got his throat between her teeth . Utterly desperate , he jammed his fingers into the newly - made breathing hole . At another time with other prey , she might have collapsed at the sudden , raw agony . But now the image of her dead son was before her , and her daughter nearly dead in the same way . What if he had merely closed their throats as he had just closed hers ? She might never have known for sure . He might have gotten away with it . She ripped his throat out . He was dying when she gave way to her own pain . He was too far gone to hurt her any more . He died with soft bubbling noises and much bleeding as she lay across him reviving herself , mending herself . She was hungry . Great God , she was hungry . The smell of blood filled her nostrils as she restored her normal breathing ability , and the smell and the flesh beneath her tormented her . She got up quickly and loped down the narrow stairs , down the main stairs . There , she hesitated . She wanted food before she changed again . She was sick with hunger now . She would be mad with it if she had to change to order food . Luisa came into the house , saw her , and stopped . The old woman was not afraid of her . There was none of that teasing fear smell to make her change swiftly before she lost her head . “
100401	100423	100398	100398	he	2223	” the old woman asked . Anyanwu lowered her cat head in what she hoped would be taken for a nod . “
100427	100431	100398	100398	he	2223	” Luisa said . “
100436	100442	100398	100398	he	2223	” Two more quick nods . “
100454	100818	100449	100449	I	0	” She went through the house and out toward the kitchen . She was a good , steady , sensible friend . She did more than sewing for her keep . Anyanwu would have kept her if she had done nothing at all . But she was so old . Over seventy . Soon some frailty that Anyanwu could not make a medicine for would take her life and another friend would be gone . People were temporary . So temporary . Disobeying orders , Iye and Helen came in through the front door and saw Anyanwu , still bloody from her kill , and not yet gone to the Wild Seed 211 dining room . If not for the presence of the child , Anyanwu would have roared her anger and discomfort at Iye . She did not like having her children see her at such a time . She loped away down the hall to the dining room . Iye stayed where she was , but allowed Helen to follow Anyanwu . Anyanwu , struggling with fear smell , blood smell , hunger , and anger , did not notice the child until they were both in the dining room . There , wearily , Anyanwu lay down on a rug before the cold fireplace . Fearlessly , the child came to sit on the rug beside her . Anyanwu looked up , knowing that her face was smeared with blood and wishing she had cleaned herself before she came downstairs . Cleaned herself and left her daughter in the care of someone more reliable . Helen stroked her , fingered her spots , caressed her as though she were a large house cat . Like most children born on the plantation , she had seen Anyanwu change her shape many times . She was as accepting of the leopard now as she had been of the black dog and the white man named Warrick who had to put in an occasional appearance for the sake of the neighbors . Somehow , under the child 's hands , Anyanwu began to relax . After a while , she began to purr . "
100821	100846	100449	100449	I	0	” the little girl said softly . This was one of the few words of Anyanwu 's language Helen knew . It meant simply , “
100849	100850	100449	100449	I	0	” “
100853	100857	100449	100449	I	0	” she repeated . “
100876	101260	100864	100864	He	60	” CHAPTER 13 Doro returned a month after Joseph Toler 's grisly corpse had been buried in the weed patch that had once been a slaves ' graveyard , and Stephen Ifeyinwa Mgbada had been buried in ground that had once been set aside for the master and his family . Joseph would be very lonely in his slave plot . No one else had been buried as a slave since Anyanwu bought the plantation . Doro arrived knowing through his special senses that both Joseph and Stephen were dead . He arrived with replacements — two boy children no older than Helen . He arrived unannounced and walked through the front door as though he owned the house . Anyanwu , unaware of his presence , was in the library writing out a list of supplies needed for the plantation . So much was purchased now instead of homemade . Soap , ordinary cloth , candles — even some medicines purchased ready - made could be trusted , though sometimes not for the purposes their makers intended . And of course , new tools were needed . Two mules had died and three others were old and would soon need replacing . Field hands needed shoes , hats . . . It was cheaper to have people working in the fields bringing in large harvests than it was to have them making things that could be bought cheaply elsewhere . That was especially important here , where there were no slaves , where people were paid for their work and supplied with decent housing and good food . It cost more to keep people decently . If Anyanwu had not been a good manager , she would have had to return to the sea much more often for the wearisome task of finding and robbing sunken vessels , then carrying away gold and precious stones — usually within her own body . She was adding a long column of figures when Doro entered with the two little boys . She turned at the sound of his footsteps and saw a pale , lean , angular man with lank , black hair and two fingers missWild Seed 213 ing from the hand he used to lower himself into the armchair near her desk . "
101265	101270	101263	101263	me	0	” he said wearily . "
101290	101353	101279	101279	We	2227	” How courteous of him to ask her to give the order , she thought bitterly . Just then , one of her daughters came to the door , stopped , and looked at Doro with alarm . Anyanwu was in her youthful female shape , after all . But Edward Warrick was known to have a handsome , educated black mistress . “
101361	101367	101354	101354	We	2227	” Anyanwu told the girl . “
101380	101467	101369	101369	Rita	156	” The girl vanished obediently , playing her role as a maid , not knowing the white stranger was only Doro . Anyanwu stared at Doro 's latest body , wanting to scream at him , order him out of her house . It was because of him that her son was dead . He had let the snake loose among her children . And what had he brought with him this time ? Young snakes ? God , she longed to be rid of him ! "
101474	101521	101469	101469	they	2229	” Doro asked her , and the two little boys looked at him wide - eyed . If they were not young snakes , he would teach them to crawl . Clearly , he did not care what was said before them . She ignored Doro . “
101527	101540	101541	101541	I	0	” she asked the boys . One nodded , a little shy . “
101544	101550	101541	101541	I	0	” the other said quickly . “
101556	101560	101561	101561	Rita	156	” she said . “
101570	101651	101561	101561	Rita	156	" She noticed that they did not look to Doro for permission to leave . They jumped up , followed her , and ran out to the kitchen when she pointed it out to them . Rita would not be pleased . It was enough , surely , to ask her to rush supper . But she would feed the children and perhaps send them to Luisa until Anyanwu called for them . Sighing , Anyanwu went back to Doro . "
101660	101664	101652	101652	You	2232	” he commented . “
101679	101683	101665	101665	I	0	” she said . “
101697	101698	101665	101665	I	0	” “
101706	101749	101665	101665	I	0	” She went to her desk , sat down , and wondered whether she could discuss this calmly with him . She had wept and cursed him so many times . But neither weeping nor cursing would move him . 214 Wild Seed "
101765	101770	101752	101752	you	2232	” she asked quietly . “
101776	101794	101773	101773	he	2743	" Anyanwu told him , told him everything , and ended with the same falsely calm question . “
101810	101811	101797	101797	you	2232	” “
101815	101832	101813	101813	Margaret	152	” Doro said , ignoring her question . Margaret was the daughter who had married Joseph . “
101835	101836	101797	101797	you	2232	” "
101887	101888	101880	101880	he	151	" "
101914	101915	101917	101917	Margaret	152	” “
101925	102105	101923	101923	her	152	” Anyanwu did not want to call the girl . Margaret had suffered more than anyone over the killings , had lost both the beautiful , worthless husband she had loved , and the younger brother she had adored . She had not even a child to console her . Joseph had not managed to make her pregnant . In the month since his and Stephen 's death , the girl had become gaunt and solemn . She had always been a lively girl who talked too much and laughed and kept people around her amused . Now , she hardly spoke at all . She was literally sick with grief . Recently , Helen had taken to sleeping with her and following her around during the day , helping her with her work or merely keeping her company . Anyanwu had watched this warily at first , thinking that Margaret might resent Helen as the cause of Joseph 's trouble — Margaret was not in the most rational of moods — but this was clearly not the case . “
102111	102117	102118	102118	She	2241	” Helen told Anyanwu confidentially . “
102126	102177	102118	102118	She	2241	” The little girl possessed an interesting combination of ruthlessness , kindness , and keen perception . Anyanwu hoped desperately Doro would never notice her . But the older girl was painfully vulnerable . And now , Doro meant to tear open wounds that had only just begun to heal . “
102199	102200	102118	102118	She	2241	” “
102210	102266	102207	102207	I	0	" Loathing him , Anyanwu went to find Margaret . The girl did not Wild Seed 215 work in the fields as some of Anyanwu 's children did , thus she was nearby . She was in the washhouse sweating and ironing a dress . Helen was with her , sprinkling and rolling other clothing . “
102273	102278	102207	102207	I	0	” Anyanwu told Margaret . “
102284	102285	102282	102282	me	0	” “
102290	102310	102207	102207	I	0	” Margaret asked . She put one iron down to heat and , without thinking , picked up another . "
102313	102366	102207	102207	I	0	” Anyanwu said softly . Margaret froze , holding the heavy iron motionless and upright in the air . Anyanwu took it from her hand and put it down on the bricks of the hearth far from the fire . She moved the other two irons away from where they were heating . "
102374	102379	102380	102380	I	0	” she told Helen . “
102390	102412	102380	102380	I	0	” Helen said nothing , only watched as Anyanwu led Margaret away . Outside the washhouse , Margaret began to tremble . "
102428	102429	102423	102423	he	2243	” “
102437	102449	102430	102430	He	2243	” Anyanwu said flatly . Margaret blinked , looked at Anyanwu . “
102455	102456	102430	102430	He	2243	” “
102480	102481	102482	102482	He	2243	” “
102486	102487	102482	102482	He	2243	” “
102513	102529	102530	102530	We	2244	” There was silence until just before they reached the house . Then Margaret said , “
102553	102554	102539	102539	You	2245	” "
102566	102579	102539	102539	You	2245	” Anyanwu said . She met the girl 's light brown eyes . “
102644	102645	102638	102638	You	2246	" “
102663	102664	102665	102665	He	2254	” “
102673	102689	102670	102670	his	2254	” She touched the smooth , red - brown skin of the girl 's face . "
102724	102725	102726	102726	You	152	” “
102734	102740	102741	102741	You	152	” said the girl solemnly . "
102745	102778	102741	102741	You	152	” She shook her head . 216 Wild Seed They went into the house together and to the library where they found Doro sitting at Anyanwu 's desk looking through her records . “
102784	102794	102741	102741	You	152	” Anyanwu said with disgust . He looked up . “
102809	102873	102804	102804	your	152	” he said . To her amazement , the praise reached her . She was not pleased that he had gone snooping through her things , but she was abruptly less annoyed . She went to the desk and stood over him silently until he smiled , got up , and took his armchair again . Margaret took another chair and sat waiting . “
102879	102893	102875	102875	you	0	” Doro asked Anyanwu . Anyanwu shook her head . He faced Margaret . “
102914	102944	102907	102907	he	151	” Margaret had been watching Doro 's new face , but as he said the word transition , she looked away , studied the pattern of the oriental rug . “
102950	102955	102907	102907	he	151	” said Doro quietly . “
102961	102965	102958	102958	he	151	" demanded Anyanwu . “
102971	102972	102973	102973	He	151	” "
102979	102983	102973	102973	He	151	” Margaret whispered . “
103082	103083	103070	103070	he	151	” “
103086	103090	103070	103070	he	151	” Anyanwu demanded . “
103110	103114	103115	103115	He	151	” Margaret nodded . “
103133	103134	103126	103126	He	151	” "
103147	103159	103176	103176	He	151	" Doro said . Margaret continued to stare at the rug . “
103162	103171	103172	103172	He	151	” Doro ordered . She wet her lips . "
103193	103205	103176	103176	He	151	” There was silence . Anyanwu looked from Margaret to Doro . “
103211	103216	103207	103207	you	60	" she asked frowning . “
103227	103231	103219	103219	I	0	” Wild Seed 217 “
103240	103241	103238	103238	Doro	60	” "
103305	103306	103290	103290	I	0	" "
103314	103318	103309	103309	you	60	” Anyanwu asked . “
103335	103336	103337	103337	He	1220	” “
103350	103351	103337	103337	He	1220	” “
103354	103355	103356	103356	He	1220	" "
103383	103415	103377	103377	I	0	" Doro leaned back and wet his lips , and Anyanwu remembered what he had done to his own family so long ago . He had told her that terrible story . “
103422	103427	103428	103428	I	0	” he said softly . “
103438	103439	103440	103440	I	0	" “
103452	103462	103444	103444	you	0	” Anyanwu said bitterly . He looked at her . "
103468	103472	103463	103463	Your	0	” he said . “
103504	103532	103533	103533	Joe	151	” He seemed utterly sincere . She could not recall the last time she had heard him apologize for anything . She stared at him , confused . “
103544	103548	103533	103533	Joe	151	" Margaret said . "
103557	103561	103554	103555	his family	3167	” Doro said . “
103578	103579	103573	103574	foster parents	2283	” “
103582	103608	103609	103609	Margaret	152	" Margaret looked away , seeming to understand , to accept . No more than half the children on the plantation lived with their parents . “
103611	103638	103609	103609	Margaret	152	” She looked up at him , then quickly looked down again . He was being remarkably gentle with her , but she was still afraid . “
103643	103647	103648	103648	I	0	” he asked . “
103653	103663	103648	103648	I	0	” she whispered . She was beginning to cry . "
103667	103671	103648	103648	I	0	” Doro said . “
103679	103697	103698	103698	Doro	60	” She got up quickly and left the room . When she was gone , Anyanwu said , “
103718	103722	103713	103713	he	151	” 218 Wild Seed "
103742	103749	103750	103750	You	60	" He hesitated , changed direction . "
103759	103760	103750	103750	You	60	” “
103767	103768	103750	103750	You	60	" “
103781	103787	103788	103788	You	60	” She made herself shrug . “
103796	103797	103788	103788	You	60	” "
103816	103817	103806	103806	Both	1427	” “
103841	103842	103843	103843	He	151	” “
103850	103855	103843	103843	He	151	” Doro continued relentlessly . “
103897	103898	103890	103895	sons of his brother 's body	2295	" “
103901	103907	103890	103895	sons of his brother 's body	2295	” Anyanwu stared at him . “
103922	103923	103924	103924	You	60	" “
103961	103988	103953	103953	You	60	” She said nothing . He made it sound as though her choice had been free , as though he had not coerced her into choosing . “
104009	104013	103996	103996	I	0	" he said . “
104083	104128	104129	104129	You	60	” Still she said nothing . What was there for her to say — or do ? He would be obeyed , or he would make her life and her children 's lives not worth living — if he did not kill them outright . “
104141	104145	104129	104129	You	60	” he said . “
104168	104169	104162	104162	Their	5098	” “
104181	104182	104176	104176	you	0	” “
104191	104195	104176	104176	you	0	“ And then ? ”
104196	104205	104176	104176	you	0	" I 'll breed them , of course . "
104209	104246	104247	104247	Doro	60	“ Let them marry and stay here . If they fit here , they 'll Wild Seed 219 want to stay . How can they become responsible men if their only future is to be bred ? ”
104265	104297	104247	104247	Doro	60	“ Do you hear yourself , woman ? First you want no part of them , now you do n't want to let go of them even when they 're grown . ”
104309	104385	104298	104298	She	2303	“ Do you think I 'm willing to throw away any child , Doro ? If there is a chance for those boys to grow up better than Joseph , why should n't I try to give them that chance ? If , when they grow up , they can be men instead of dogs who know nothing except how to climb onto one female after another , why should n't I try to help ? ”
104389	104411	104386	104386	He	60	“ I knew you would help and not grudgingly . Do n't you think I know you by now , Anyanwu ? ”
104424	104441	104414	104414	he	60	“ Will you do it then ? Let them marry and stay here if they fit ? ”
104442	104445	104446	104446	She	2304	“ Yes . "
104464	104483	104446	104446	She	2304	“ Will you take them away if they do n't fit , ca n't fit , like Joseph ? ”
104484	104487	104488	104488	he	60	“ Yes , ”
104491	104501	104488	104488	he	60	“ Their seed is too valuable to be wasted . ”
104510	104522	104523	104523	She	2304	“ Shall I stay with you for a while , Anyanwu ? ”
104552	104562	104544	104544	he	60	“ Will you go if I ask you to ? "
104563	104566	104569	104569	He	60	“ Yes . ”
104592	104595	104596	104596	she	2304	“ Go , ”
104604	104618	104596	104596	she	2304	“ Your presence is disruptive here , Doro . You frighten my people . ”
104632	104636	104637	104637	he	60	“ Tomorrow morning , "
104801	104807	104808	104808	Luisa	150	“ Go to the sea , ”
104825	104845	104808	104808	Luisa	150	“ The sea cleanses you . I have seen it . Go and be a fish for a while . "
104846	104852	104853	104853	Anyanwu	61	" I 'm all right , ”
104867	104904	104857	104857	Luisa	150	“ You are not all right ! You are acting like the child you appear to be ! Get away from here for a while . Give yourself a rest and us a rest from you . "
104914	104920	104857	104857	Luisa	150	“ A rest from me ? ”
104921	104940	104941	104941	Anyanwu	61	“ Those of us who can feel your pain as you feel it need a rest from you . "
104984	104989	104990	104990	she	61	“ I 'll go , ”
104999	105007	104994	104996	The old woman	4036	“ It will be good for you . ”
105375	105385	105386	105386	he	1386	" What 's this about your going to sea ? ”
105449	105461	105462	105462	she	61	“ I need to go away from here for a while , ”
105465	105473	105462	105462	she	61	“ Where will you go this time ? ”
105474	105483	105484	105484	She	61	“ To find the nearest school of dolphins . ”
105599	105610	105611	105611	Kane	160	“ You 'll fly to open water wo n't you ? ”
105614	105626	105611	105611	Kane	160	“ Fly and run . Sometimes it 's safer to run . "
105627	105630	105631	105631	he	1386	“ Christ ! ”
105634	105644	105631	105631	he	1386	“ I thought I 'd gotten over envying you . "
105717	105724	105725	105725	she	61	" If you 're not afraid , ”
105728	105744	105725	105725	she	61	“ when I come back , I 'll try to share the experience with you . ”
105750	105783	105784	105784	He	160	" I do n't have the control . Stephen used to be able to share things with me . . . both of us working together , but me alone . . . ”
105804	105810	105811	105811	she	61	“ I 'm leaving now , "
106009	106016	105988	105988	Rita	156	“ I suppose you 're hungry . ”
106025	106047	106022	106022	Rita	156	“ You make a fine , handsome bird . I wonder how you would look on the dining - room table . ”
106525	106539	106521	106522	the stranger	2724	“ The sea has done you good . You were right to go . ”
106598	106603	106604	106604	she	61	“ Where is Luisa ? ”
106668	106674	106657	106657	Julien	162	“ She died , Mama . "
106777	106783	106784	106784	Anyanwu	61	“ How did she die ? ”
106788	106793	106794	106794	Julien	162	" In her sleep , ”
106797	106818	106794	106794	Julien	162	“ She went to bed one night , and the next morning , the children could n't wake her up . "
106819	106826	106827	106827	Leah	159	“ That was two weeks ago , "
106830	106853	106827	106827	Leah	159	“ We got the priest to come out because we knew she 'd want it . We gave her a fine funeral . ”
106857	106888	106854	106854	Leah	159	“ She . . . she did n't have any pain . I lay down on her bed to see , and I saw her go out just as easy ... "
107132	107138	107139	107139	she	61	“ What do you want ? ”
107143	107146	107139	107139	she	61	“ Nothing . "
107162	107173	107174	107174	she	61	“ What , no more children for me to raise ? ”
107178	107189	107174	107174	she	61	" No more unsuitable mates for my children ? Nothing ? ”
107190	107230	107231	107231	Anyanwu	61	" I brought a pregnant woman and her two children , and I brought an account at a New Orleans bank to help pay their way . I did n't come to you to talk about them , though . ”
107249	107257	107258	107258	he	60	" It goes on , you know , ”
107261	107265	107258	107258	he	60	“ The dying . ”
107266	107273	107231	107231	Anyanwu	61	" It does n't hurt you . ”
107274	107289	107258	107258	he	60	" It does . When my children die — the best of my children . ”
107290	107296	107258	107258	he	60	“ What do you do ? ”
107301	107325	107258	107258	he	60	" Endure it . What is there to do but endure it ? Someday , we 'll have others who wo n't die . ”
107326	107334	107258	107258	he	60	“ Are you still dreaming that dream ? ”
107335	107349	107350	107350	She	61	“ What could I do , Anyanwu , if I gave it up ? "
107359	107368	107369	107369	she	61	“ I used to believe in it too , "
107372	107406	107369	107369	she	61	“ When you took me from my people , I believed it . For fifty years , I made myself believe it . Perhaps . . . perhaps sometimes I still believe it . "
107407	107417	107258	107258	he	60	“ You never behaved as though you believed it . ”
107418	107453	107454	107454	He	2414	" I did ! I let you do all the things you did to me and to others , and I stayed with you until I could see you had decided to kill me . "
107460	107467	107468	107468	he	2414	“ That decision was a mistake , ”
107471	107513	107468	107468	he	2414	“ I made it out of habit as though you were just another not entirely controllable , wild - seed woman who had had her quota of children . Centuries - old habit said it was time to dispose of you . ”
107514	107522	107523	107523	she	2415	“ And what of your habit now ? ”
107526	107538	107539	107539	He	2414	“ It 's broken now as far as you 're concerned . ”
107548	107574	107539	107539	He	2414	“ I want you alive for as long as you can live . You can not know how I have fought with myself over this . ”
107584	107594	107595	107595	he	2414	" I tried hard to make myself kill you , ”
107598	107610	107595	107595	he	2414	“ It would have been easier than trying to change you . "
107677	107684	107685	107685	he	2414	" Do you like this body ? ”
107688	107696	107685	107685	he	2414	“ It 's my gift to you . "
107709	107712	107717	107717	He	2414	“ gift . ”
107713	107716	107717	107717	He	2414	" Anyanwu ! ”
107738	107760	107761	107761	he	2414	“ You 're still the little forest peasant , trying to climb the ship 's railings and swim back to Africa , ”
107764	107780	107761	107761	he	2414	“ You still want what you ca n't have . The old woman is dead . ”
107787	107796	107797	107797	he	2414	“ They 'll all die , except me , ”
107800	107823	107797	107797	he	2414	" Because of me , you were not alone on the ship . Because of me , you will never be alone . ”
108037	108047	108048	108048	he	2414	“ I 'm going to try something with you , "
108051	108093	108048	108048	he	2414	“ I 've wanted to do it for years . Before you ran away , I assumed I would do it someday . Now . . . now everything is changed , but I mean to have some of this anyway . "
108094	108099	108100	108100	she	2415	" Some of what ? ”
108104	108111	108100	108100	she	2415	“ What are you talking about ? ”
108112	108118	108119	108119	he	2414	" I ca n't explain , ”
108122	108133	108119	108119	he	2414	“ But ... Look at me , Anyanwu . Look ! "
108143	108150	108151	108151	he	2414	" I wo n't hurt you , ”
108154	108216	108151	108151	he	2414	" Hear and see whatever it is that helps you know I 'm being honest with you . I wo n't hurt you . You 'll be in danger only if you disobey me . This body of mine is strong and young and new to me . My control is excellent . Obey me , and you will be safe . ”
108222	108239	108217	108217	She	2415	“ Tell me what you want , Doro . What shall I do for you now ? ”
108250	108266	108244	108244	he	2421	" Just lie still and trust me . Believe that I mean you no harm . ”
108406	108415	108416	108416	He	2421	“ Doro , have I hurt your throat ? ”
108423	108439	108416	108416	He	2421	“ Not much . I was ready for you , or I thought I was . "
108440	108458	108398	108398	She	2415	“ What did you do ? It was like the kind of dream children wake screaming from . ”
108459	108464	108465	108465	he	2421	“ Alter your hands , ”
108468	108471	108465	108465	he	2421	“ What ? ”
108472	108482	108487	108487	she	2415	“ Obey me . Make claws of your hands . "
108493	108496	108497	108497	Doro	60	“ Good , ”
108500	108521	108497	108497	Doro	60	“ I did n't even weaken you . My control is as steady as I thought . Now change back . ”
108528	108540	108522	108522	He	2421	“ I would n't want you going at me with those . ”
108573	108581	108545	108545	She	2415	“ Doro , what are we doing ? ”
108582	108587	108588	108588	he	2421	“ Do you see , ”
108591	108607	108588	108588	he	2421	“ that the ... the thing you felt has not harmed you in any way ? ”
108608	108614	108545	108545	She	2415	“ But what was it ? ”
108615	108648	108545	108545	She	2415	“ Wait , Anyanwu . Trust me . I 'll explain all I can later , I promise you . For now , relax . I 'm going to do it again . ”
108649	108652	108588	108588	he	2421	“ No ! ”
108653	108686	108687	108687	He	2421	“ It wo n't hurt you . It will be as though you were in midair under Isaac 's control . He would never have hurt you . I wo n't either . ”
108714	108718	108719	108719	he	2421	" Be still , "
108722	108730	108719	108719	he	2421	“ Let me have this , Anyanwu . ”
108731	108746	108760	108760	she	2424	“ It will ... please you somehow — as though we were making love ? ”
108747	108751	108789	108789	his	2421	" Even more . "
108752	108756	108757	108757	She	2424	" All right . ”
108867	108875	108876	108876	he	60	“ Do n't fight me this time , ”
108879	108917	108876	108876	he	60	“ I 'm no match for you in 228 Wild Seed physical strength . You know that . Now that you know what to expect , you can be still and let it happen . Trust me . ”
108927	108931	108932	108932	she	2424	" All right , ”
108955	108960	108961	108961	he	60	" I like contact , ”
108967	108976	108961	108961	he	60	“ It 's never as good without contact . ”
108996	108999	109000	109000	he	60	“ Now , ”
109936	109938	109943	109943	He	60	“ family ”
110102	110105	110106	110106	she	61	“ Doro ? "
110165	110170	110171	110171	she	61	" I was dying , ”
110174	110180	110171	110171	she	61	" No you were n't . ”
110181	110189	110190	110190	He	60	" I was dying . You were — ”
110213	110225	110226	110226	he	60	“ I had to know you that way at least once , ”
110229	110238	110226	110226	he	60	“ I had to touch you that way . ”
110239	110242	110243	110243	she	61	“ Why ? "
110246	110259	110243	110243	she	61	“ Because it 's the closest I 'll ever come to you . ”
110327	110340	110341	110341	she	61	" Is it that way , that easy for all the others ? ”
110363	110371	110372	110372	he	60	“ Fear makes it worse for them , ”
110375	110396	110372	110372	he	60	“ And they 're always afraid . Also . . . I have no reason to be gentle with them . "
110397	110407	110341	110341	she	61	“ Do you hurt them ? Is there pain ? ”
110408	110431	110372	110372	he	60	“ No . I feel what they feel so I know . They do n't feel pain any more than you did . ”
110432	110438	110439	110439	she	61	“ It was ... good , ”
110444	110458	110439	110439	she	61	“ Until I thought you would kill me , it was so good . ”
110472	110478	110479	110479	she	61	“ We should go upstairs , ”
110482	110485	110479	110479	she	61	“ Soon . "
110486	110492	110493	110493	she	61	“ What shall I do ? ”
110496	110519	110493	110493	she	61	“ I have fought you all these years . My reasons for fighting you all still exist . What shall I do ? ”
110520	110544	110546	110547	Wild Seed	84	“ What Isaac wanted . What you want . Join with me . What 's the good of fighting me ? Especially now . ”
110548	110551	110552	110552	She	61	" Now ... "
110731	110736	110737	110737	she	2454	“ Nothing is solved , "
110740	110754	110737	110737	she	2454	“ except that now , I must fight myself as well as you . ”
110755	110761	110762	110762	he	60	" You 're talking foolishness , ”
110771	110779	110780	110780	she	2454	“ Let it be foolishness for now , "
110783	110792	110780	110780	she	2454	“ Let it be foolishness for this moment . ”
110803	110815	110793	110793	She	2454	“ You do n't want to go upstairs , do you ? ”
110816	110819	110780	110780	she	2454	" No . "
110820	110834	110780	110780	she	2454	“ We 'll stay here then . My children will whisper about me . "
110835	110840	110793	110793	She	2454	“ Do you care ? ”
110841	110848	110849	110849	she	2454	“ Now you are talking foolishness , ”
110854	110870	110849	110849	she	2454	“ Do I care ! Whose house is this ? I do as I please ! ”
111006	111019	111020	111020	Anyanwu	61	“ Bring this body back to me as long as you can , ”
111025	111036	111037	111037	He	60	“ There can not be two as perfect as this . ”
111711	111720	111721	111721	Iye	157	" I 'm glad you could do this , ”
111725	111742	111721	111721	Iye	157	“ I think it would be too hard for me to share him with anyone else . ”
111876	111885	111886	111886	Doro	60	“ What are you going to do now ? ”
111904	111909	111886	111886	Doro	60	“ Push me away ? ”
111928	111943	111919	111919	she	61	“ Shall I do that ? Yes , I think so . Go away . ”
111965	111979	111980	111980	she	61	“ You will be father to one like this in seven months more , "
111983	111989	111980	111980	she	61	“ You 're pregnant now ? "
111990	112015	111959	111959	He	167	“ Yes . I wanted a child by this body of yours . I was afraid you would be getting rid of it soon . ”
112016	112021	112022	112022	he	167	" I will be , ”
112025	112049	112022	112022	he	167	" I 'll have to . But eventually you 'll have two children to nurse . Wo n't that be hard on you ? ”
112053	112066	112050	112051	Wild Seed	60	“ I can do it . Do you think I ca n't ? ”
112067	112070	112071	112071	He	167	" No . "
112075	112089	112071	112071	He	167	“ If only I had more like you and Iye . That Susan ... "
112090	112100	112101	112101	Anyanwu	61	" I 've found a home for her child , ”
112104	112136	112101	112101	Anyanwu	61	“ It wo n't be fostered with the older ones , but it will have loving parents . And Susan is big and strong . She 's a fine field hand . ”
112137	112170	112071	112071	He	167	" I did n't bring her here to be a field hand . I thought living with your people might help her — calm her and make her a little more useful . "
112171	112175	112176	112176	She	61	" It has . ”
112184	112259	112176	112176	She	61	“ Here , if people fit in , I let them do whatever work they prefer . That helps to calm them . Susan prefers field work to anything indoors . She is willing to have as many more children as you want , but caring for them is beyond her . She seems especially sensitive to their thoughts . Their thoughts hurt her somehow . She is a good woman otherwise , Doro . ”
112290	112298	112299	112299	he	60	“ Give me some of the milk , ”
112341	112352	112353	112353	she	61	" I had a man who used to do that , ”
112356	112361	112353	112353	she	61	" Did you mind ? ”
112362	112365	112366	112366	He	60	" No . "
112373	112377	112378	112378	she	61	“ Come here , ”
112670	112676	112677	112677	she	61	“ Are you getting up ? "
112680	112698	112665	112665	She	61	“ Yes . But there is no reason for you to . It 's not even dawn . ”
112699	112711	112712	112712	He	60	“ Are you going away ? You 've just come back . ”
112716	112728	112712	112712	He	60	" Perhaps I 'll come back again in a few days . "
112761	112767	112768	112768	she	61	“ Stay a little longer , ”
112774	112779	112780	112780	he	60	" I ca n't , ”
112794	112804	112805	112805	she	61	“ You were asleep when I fed the child , ”
112808	112821	112805	112805	she	61	“ But there is still milk for you if you want it . "
113012	113023	113024	113024	Frank	165	" Are you going to be wearing that body long ? "
113040	113053	113054	113054	Doro	60	" No , I 've already got what I need from it , ”
113057	113074	113054	113054	Doro	60	" It 's a good body though . It could last a year , maybe two . "
113075	113085	113037	113038	Wild Seed	61	“ But it would n't do Anyanwu much good . ”
113086	113127	113054	113054	Doro	60	" It might if it were anyone but Susan . Anyanwu 's had wives , after all . But she knew Susan , liked her . Except in emergencies , I do n't ask people to overcome feelings like that . ”
113128	113133	113134	113134	Frank	165	“ You and Anyanwu , ”
113137	113146	113134	113134	Frank	165	“ Changing sex , changing color , breeding like- "
113148	113153	113154	113154	Doro	60	" Shut your mouth , "
113159	113179	113154	113154	Doro	60	“ or I 'll tell you a few things you do n't want to hear about your own family . ”
113377	113387	113390	113390	she	61	“ You did take Susan , did n't you ? ”
113683	113691	113692	113693	the child	484	" She wo n't talk to me , ”
113697	113709	113710	113710	She	484	“ She knows I know what she 's going to do . ”
113786	113792	113793	113793	he	60	“ What do you mean ? ”
113797	113805	113793	113793	he	60	“ What is she going to do ? ”
113826	113852	113818	113819	a woman	2710	“ She says Kane and Leah are going to come and live here . She says after the baby comes , she 's going away . ”
113853	113857	113793	113793	he	60	“ To sea ? ”
113858	113902	113937	113937	she	2556	“ No , Doro . Not to sea . Someday , she would have to come out of the sea . Then you would find her again , and she would have to watch you kill her friends , kill your own friends . "
113903	113910	113911	113911	He	2555	“ What are you talking about ? ”
114080	114086	114087	114087	he	2555	“ What are those things ? ”
114093	114097	114098	114098	she	2556	“ A medicine , ”
114101	114116	114098	114098	she	2556	“ or a poison if people do n't know what to do with it . "
114117	114127	114056	114056	she	2556	“ What are you going to do with it ? ”

114179	114200	114056	114056	she	2556	“ This will work just as well . I 'm going to teach some of the women to make it . ”
114201	114204	114156	114156	his	60	“ Why ? ”
114205	114225	114226	114226	He	2555	“ So that they can heal themselves and their families without depending on what they see as my magic . ”
114240	114261	114226	114226	He	2555	“ And why should n't they depend on your magic ? Your medicines are more efficient than any ground weed . ”
114265	114273	114262	114262	She	2556	“ They should learn to help themselves . ”
114286	114296	114274	114274	He	2555	“ Come into the house and talk with me . ”
114297	114304	114316	114316	his	2555	“ There is nothing to say . "
114305	114313	114314	114314	He	2555	“ Come in anyway . Humor me . ”
114397	114430	114389	114389	Susan	166	“ ' Be of the same mine one toward another . Mind not high things , but condescend to men of low estate . Be not wise in your own conceits . ' ”
114435	114453	114454	114454	he	60	“ That sounds as though it would be an unpopular scripture in this part of the country , ”
114457	114472	114454	114454	he	60	" I see to it that they learn some of the less popular ones , ”
114476	114481	114473	114473	Anyanwu	61	“ There is another : "
114516	114517	114518	114518	You	2573	" "
114527	114531	114518	114518	You	2573	” She shrugged . “
114552	114563	114539	114539	They	2574	Besides”-she glanced at him , the corners of her mouth turned down—“besides
114571	114587	114588	114588	Christians	2579	” 240 Wild Seed He ignored her sarcasm , took her into the back parlor . “
114601	114605	114606	114606	They	2579	” he said . “
114622	114623	114617	114617	they	2579	” "
114633	114663	114624	114624	Anyanwu	61	” He would not have thought he could say the words so calmly . What would she think ? That he did not care ? Could she think that ? "
114674	114686	114624	114624	Anyanwu	61	” she said simply . He digested that for a moment . “
114710	114714	114716	114716	you	61	” he said . “
114725	114726	114716	114716	you	61	” “
114741	114742	114736	114736	you	0	” "
114772	114779	114759	114759	You	61	” She shook her head slowly . “
114786	114828	114781	114781	you	61	” He frowned , staring at her . She had not said such things since their night together in the library . She had never said them this way , matter - of - factly , as though she were saying , “
114833	114846	114829	114829	You	61	” He found that he could not even manufacture anger against her . “
114852	114856	114829	114829	You	61	” he asked . "
114868	114869	114865	114865	you	0	" “
114877	114878	114872	114872	I	0	” “
114882	114925	114872	114872	I	0	” She was as she had been after Luisa 's death — uncharacteristically passive , ready to die . Then it was loneliness and grief pressing on her , weighing her down then . Now ... what was it now , really ? "
114930	114934	114928	114928	Susan	166	” he asked . “
114947	114948	114949	114949	I	0	” "
114963	114964	114957	114957	She	166	” “
114967	114968	114969	114969	You	0	" “
114976	114977	114969	114969	You	0	” “
115015	115932	115007	115007	you	0	” Anyanwu got up and walked out of the room . Later , he tried to talk to her again . She would not listen . She would not argue with him or curse him . When he offered again to go , she asked him to stay . When he came to her room at night , she was strangely , quietly welcoming . And she was still planning to die . There was an obscenity . An immortal , a woman who could live idn't think yowas it now , realissing on Wild Seed 241 through the millennia with him , yet she was intent on suicide and he was not even certain why . He became more desperate as her pregnancy advanced , because he could not reach her , he could not touched her . She admitted she needed him , said she loved him , but some part of her was closed away from him and nothing he said could reach it . Finally , he did go away for a few weeks . He did not like what she was doing to him . He could not remember a time when his thoughts had been so confused , when he had wanted so badly , so painfully , something he could not have . He had done what Anyanwu had apparently not done . He had allowed her to touch him as though he were an ordinary man . He had allowed her to awaken feelings in him that had been dormant for several times as long as even she had been alive . He had all but stripped himself before her . It amazed him that he could do such a thing or that she could see him do it , and not care . She , of all people ! He went down to Baton Rouge to a woman he had once known . She was married now , but , as it happened , her husband was in Boston and she welcomed Doro . He stayed with her for a few days , always on the verge of telling her about Anyanwu , but never quite getting around to it . He took a new body — that of a free black who owned several slaves and treated them brutally . Afterward , he wondered why he had killed the man . It was no concern of his how a slaveholder treated his chattels . He shed the slaveholder body and took that of another free black -one who could have been a lighter - skinned brother to the one Anyanwu had liked , compact , handsome , red - brown . Perhaps she would reject it because it was too like the other one without being the other one . Perhaps she would reject it because it was too unlike the other one . Who knew which way her mind would turn . But perhaps she would accept it and talk to him and close the distance between them before she shut herself off like used machinery . He went home to her . Her belly got in the way when he hugged her in greeting . On any other occasion , he would have laughed and stroked it , thinking of his child inside . Now , he only looked at it , realized that she could give birth any time . How stupid he had been to go away and leave her , to give up any part of what might be their last days together . 242 Wild Seed She took his hand and led him into the house while her son Julien took his horse . Julien gave Doro a long , frightened , pleading look that Doro did not acknowledge . Clearly , the man knew . Inside the house , he got the same kinds of looks from Leah and Kane , whom Anyanwu had sent for . Nobody said anything except in ordinary greeting , but the house was filled with tension . It was as though everyone felt it but Anyanwu . She seemed to feel nothing except solemn pleasure in having Doro home again . Supper was quiet , almost grim , and everyone seemed to have something to do to keep from lingering at the table . Everyone but Doro . He coaxed Anyanwu to share wine and fruit and nuts and talk with him in the smaller , cooler back parlor . As it turned out , they shared wine and fruit and nuts and silence , but it did not matter . It was enough that she was with him . Anyanwu 's child , a tiny , sturdy boy , was born two weeks after Doro 's return , and Doro became almost sick with desperation . He did not know how to deal with his feelings , could not recall ever having had such an intense confusion of feelings before . Sometimes he caught himself observing his own behavior as though from a distance and noticing with even greater confusion that there was nothing outwardly visible in him to show what he was suffering . He spent as much time as he could with Anyanwu , watching her prepare and mix her herbs ; instruct several of her people at a time in their cultivation , appearance and use ; tend those few who could not wait for this or that herb . “
115944	115949	115955	115955	they	2585	” he asked her . "
115958	115962	115955	115955	they	2585	” she said . “
115971	116163	116164	116164	You	2586	" She found a woman to nurse her baby and she gave calm instructions to a frightened Leah . She considered Leah the strangest and the brightest of her white daughters and the one most competent to succeed her . Kane did not want this . He felt threatened , even frightened , by the thought of suddenly greater visibility . He would become more noticeable to people of his father 's class people who might have known his father . Doro thought this too unlikely to worry about . He found himself trying to explain to the man that if Kane played his role as well as Doro had always seen him play it , and if also he clearly possessed all the trappings of a wealthy planter , it would never occur to people to assume that he was anyWild Seed 243 thing but a wealthy planter . Doro told the story of Frank 's passing him off as a Christianized African prince , and he and Kane laughed together over it . There had not been much laughter in the house recently , and even this ended abruptly . "
116170	116183	116184	116184	You	2586	" Kane said as though they had been discussing Anyanwu all along . “
116196	116197	116198	116198	I	0	” “
116206	116225	116198	116198	I	0	” Doro admitted bleakly . Kane would have no idea how unusual such an admission was from him . “
116240	116241	116244	116244	she	2587	" “
116251	116292	116244	116244	she	2587	” Doro said . Kane blinked , then shook his head helplessly . Even he understood that it was impossible . Leah came into the back parlor where they were talking and stood before Doro , hands on her hips . “
116301	116305	116293	116293	I	0	" she said . “
116329	116330	116326	116326	her	2587	” "
116333	116337	116326	116326	her	2587	” Doro asked . "
116371	116388	116369	116369	Luisa	150	" Doro stood up to go , but Kane stopped him with a question to Leah . “
116404	116422	116398	116398	she	2587	" Leah looked from one man to another , saw that they were both awaiting her answer . “
116429	116433	116423	116423	I	0	” she said . “
116445	116478	116437	116437	she	2587	” She had seemed weary , Doro thought . But weary of what ? Him ? She had begged him not to go away again — not that he had planned to . "
116483	116547	116434	116434	She	2587	” he asked . Leah held her hands in front of her and looked down at them . She opened and closed the fingers as though to grasp something , but she held only air . She gestured sometimes when receiving or remembering images and impressions no one else could see . In ordinary society , people would certainly have thought her demented . "
116555	116559	116434	116434	She	2587	” she said . “
116603	116607	116598	116598	She	2588	” 244 Wild Seed "
116615	116619	116612	116612	her	2588	” Kane said . “
116629	116635	116636	116636	I	0	” Leah shook her head . “
116660	116673	116656	116656	She	2588	" Leah made a sound of frustration and distress almost a sob . "
116681	116685	116674	116674	I	0	” she said . “
116733	116753	116726	116726	I	0	” Doro said nothing , stood still , trying to make sense of the strange grasping , the weariness . “
116761	116770	116726	116726	I	0	” Leah screamed . And then more softly , “
116801	116889	116799	116799	you	2589	” He left them and went looking for Anyanwu . He had not thought in terms of healing her before . Let the tables be turned , then . Let him do what he could to heal the healer . He found her in her bedroom , gowned for bed and hanging her dress up to air . She had begun wearing dresses exclusively when her pregnancy began to show . She smiled warmly as Doro came in , as though she were glad to see him . “
116894	116901	116799	116799	you	2589	” he said . She nodded . “
116910	116911	116906	116906	I	0	” “
116928	116938	116914	116914	Leah	159	" She faced him for a moment , sighed . “
116947	116948	116949	116949	You	0	” “
116957	116958	116959	116959	I	0	" “
116963	116964	116959	116959	I	0	” "
116967	117029	116959	116959	I	0	” He stepped to her , caught her by the shoulders as though his holding her could keep life in her . She thrust him away with strength he had not felt in her since before Isaac 's death . He was thrown back against the wall and would have fallen if there had not been a wall to stop him . “
117039	117044	116959	116959	I	0	” she said softly . “
117060	117083	117051	117051	you	0	” He doused a reflexive flare of anger , stared at her as he rubbed the shoulder that had struck the wall . “
117088	117092	116959	116959	I	0	” he whispered . “
117099	117100	117101	117101	I	0	” “
117105	117112	117101	117101	I	0	” She climbed onto the bed . “
117117	117260	117261	117261	I	0	” Wild Seed 245 She did not get under her blanket , but sat on top of it , watching him . She said nothing , only watched . Finally he drew a deep , shuddering breath and sat down in the chair nearest her bed . He was shaking . His strong , perfectly good new body was shaking as though he had all but worn it out . He had to stop her . He had to . He looked at her and thought he saw compassion in her eyes — as though in a moment , she could come to him , hold him not only as a lover , but as one of her children to be comforted . He would have permitted her to do this . He would have welcomed it . She did not move . “
117266	117271	117261	117261	I	0	” she said softly , “
117377	117378	117379	117379	I	0	” "
117393	117397	117398	117398	You	2593	” he said . “
117404	117405	117398	117398	You	2593	" “
117413	117414	117415	117415	I	0	” "
117417	117418	117415	117415	I	0	" “
117524	117525	117519	117519	It	2599	" "
117528	117559	117519	117519	It	2599	" He closed his eyes , tried to still his trembling . Finally , he gave up , looked over at her . If he could only make her see . “
117598	117627	117594	117594	you	60	” He wanted to touch her , but in his present state , he dared not risk being thrown across the room again . She must touch him . “
117635	117639	117628	117628	I	0	” he said . “
117663	117664	117665	117665	Someone	185	" “
117677	117682	117665	117665	Someone	185	” she said tonelessly . “
117734	117735	117736	117736	You	0	” “
117741	117745	117736	117736	You	0	” she said . “
117754	117762	117750	117750	you	0	” She sighed , shook her head . “
117791	117897	117783	117783	I	0	” He stood up , furious with her , not knowing whether to curse or to plead . His legs were weak under him and he felt himself on the verge of obscene weeping . Why did n't she help him ? She helped everyone else ! He longed to get away from her — or kill her . Why should she be allowed to waste all her strength and power in suicide while he stood before her , his face wet with perspiration , his body trembling like a palsied old man . But he could not leave or kill . It was impossible . “
117906	117991	117992	117992	Anyanwu	61	" He had control of his voice , at least . He did not have that half - in - and - half - out - of - his - body sound that frightened most people and that would have made Anyanwu think he was trying to frighten her . Anyanwu pulled back the blanket and sheet and lay down . He knew suddenly that she would die now . Right in front of him , she would lie there and shut herself off . "
117994	118008	117992	117992	Anyanwu	61	” He was on the bed with her , pulling her up again . “
118011	118020	118023	118023	Anyanwu	61	” he said not hearing himself any longer . “
118027	118033	118036	118036	me	0	” She was still alive . “
118069	118073	118074	118075	Sun Woman	62	" He swallowed . “
118083	118403	118074	118075	Sun Woman	62	” His voice caught and broke . He wept . He choked out great sobs that shook his already shaking body almost beyond bearing . He wept as though for all the past times when no tears would come , when there was no relief . He could not stop . He did not know when she pulled off his boots and pulled the blanket up over him , when she bathed his face in cool water . He did know the comfort of her arms , the warmth of her body next to him . He slept , finally , exhausted , his head on her breast , and at sunrise when he awoke , that breast was still warm , still rising and falling gently with her breathing . EPILOGUE There had to be changes . Anyanwu could not have all she wanted , and Doro could no longer have all that he had once considered his by right . She stopped him from destroying his breeders after they had served him . She could not stop him from killing altogether , but she could extract a promise from him that there be no more Susans , no more Thomases . If anyone had earned the right to be safe from him , to have his protection , it was these people . He did not command her any longer . She was no longer one of his breeders , nor even one of his people in the old proprietary way . He could ask her cooperation , her help , but he could no longer coerce her into giving it . There would be no more threats to her children . He would not interfere with her children at all . There was disagreement here . She wanted him to promise that he would not interfere with any of her descendants , but he would not . “
118421	118449	118405	118405	you	2606	” he asked her . And , of course , she did not , though she thought by now they would no doubt make a fine nation . “
118462	118466	118457	118457	I	0	” he said . “
118490	118644	118645	118645	You	2610	” Thus , uncomfortably , she settled for protecting her children and any grandchildren or even strangers who became members of her household . These were hers to protect , hers to teach , hers to move if she wished . When it became clear within a few years that there would be a war between the Northern and Southern states , she chose to move her people to California . The move displeased him . He thought she was leaving not only to get away from the coming war , but to make it more difficult for him to break his word regarding her children . Crossing the continent , sailing around the Horn , or cross- 248 Wild Seed ing the Isthmus of Panama to reach her would not be quick or simple matters even for him . He accused her of not trusting him , and she admitted it freely . "
118651	118655	118645	118645	You	2610	” she said . “
118668	118680	118664	118664	we	2611	” Then she eased it all by kissing him and saying , “
118704	118785	118800	118800	she	2613	” It never had . He would see her . He stopped her cross - country plans by putting her and her people on one of his own clippers and returning to her one of the best of her descendants by Isaac to keep her safe from storms . In California , she finally took a European name : Emma . She had heard that it meant grandmother or ancestress , and this amused her . She became Emma Anyanwu . “
