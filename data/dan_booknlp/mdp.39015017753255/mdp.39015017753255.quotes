Medea . 1 1 Contents 1 47 A ON 1 2 3 4 The Emperor The Queen of Spades The Zero Winter 77 The Rock 131 i. 1 the Emperor a It was Napoleon who had such a passion for chicken that he kept his chefs working around the clock . What a kitchen that was , with birds in every state of undress ; some still cold and slung over hooks , some turning slowly on the spit , but most in wasted piles because the Emperor was busy . Odd to be so governed by an appetite . It was my first commission . I started as a neck wringer and before long I was the one who carried the platter through inches of mud to his tent . He liked me because I am short . I flatter myself . He did not dislike me . He liked no one except Joséphine and he liked her the way he liked chicken . No one over five foot two ever waited on the Emperor . He kept small servants and large horses . The horse he loved was seventeen hands high with a tail that could wrap round a man three times and still make a wig for his mistress . That horse had the evil eye and there 's been almost as many dead grooms in the stable as chickens on the table . The ones the beast did n't kill itself with an easy kick , its master had disposed of because its coat did n't shine or the bit was green . “ A new government must dazzle and amaze , '

In the morning I 'll be lucky to find the wishbone . There is no heat , only degrees of cold . I do n't remember the feeling of a fire against my knees . Even in the kitchen , the warmest place on any camp , the heat is too thin to spread and the copper pans cloud over . I take off my socks once a week to 4 THE EMPEROR cut my toe - nails and the others call me a dandy . We 're
1290	1458	1289	1289	I	0	'm telling you stories . Trust me . a I wanted to be a drummer . The recruiting officer gave me a walnut and asked if I could crack it between finger and thumb . I could not and he laughed and said a drummer must have strong hands . I stretched out my palm , the walnut resting there , and offered him the same challenge . He coloured up and had a Lieutenant take me to the kitchen tents . The cook sized up my skinny frame and reckoned I was not a cleaver man . Not for me the mess of unnamed meat that had to be chopped for the daily stew . He said I was lucky , that I would be working for Bonaparte himself , and for one brief , bright moment I imagined a training as a pastry cook building delicate towers of sugar and cream . We walked towards a small tent with two impassive guards by the flaps . '
1464	1583	1289	1289	I	0	' said the cook . The space from the ground to the dome of the canvas was racked with rough wooden cages about a foot square with tiny corridors running in between , hardly the width of a man . In each cage there were two or three birds , beaks and claws cut 5 THE PASSION off , staring through the slats with dumb identical eyes . I am no coward and I 've seen plenty of convenient mutilation on our farms but I was not prepared for the silence . Not even a rustle . They could have been dead , should have been dead , but for the eyes . The cook turned to go . '

It was a boot that woke me , hard and shiny with a familiar saddle smell . I raised my head and saw it resting on my belly the way I had rested the walnut in my palm . The officer did n't look at me , but said , '
1686	1708	1709	1709	He	284	're a soldier now and you 'll get plenty of opportunity to sleep in the open air . On your feet . '
1738	2027	1711	1711	his	284	' I heard of his reputation soon enough but he never bothered me . I think the chicken smell kept him away . . . I was homesick from the start . I missed my mother . I missed the hill where the sun slants across the valley . I missed all the everyday things I had hated . In spring at home the dandelions streak the fields and the river runs idle again after months of rain . When the army recruitment came it was a brave band of us who laughed and said it was time we saw more than the red barn and the cows we had birthed . We signed up straight away and those of us who could n't write made an optimistic smear on the page . Our village holds a bonfire every year at the end of winter . a We had been building it for weeks , tall as a cathedral with a blasphemous spire of broken snares and infested pallets . There would be plenty of wine and dancing and a sweetheart in the 6 THE EMPEROR dark and because we were leaving we were allowed to light it . As the sun went down we plunged our five burning brands into the heart of the pyre . My mouth went dry as I heard the wood take and splinter until the first flame pushed its way out . I wished I were a holy man then with an angel to protect me so I could jump inside the fire and see my sins burned away . I go to . confession but there 's no fervour there . Do it from the heart or not at all . We 're

2442	2631	2434	2440	Someone who 's not on your side	302	' We were on our way to join the Army of England at Boulogne . Boulogne , a sleepy nothing port with a handful of whorehouses , suddenly became the springboard of Empire . Only twenty miles away , easy to see on a clear day , was England and her arrogance . We knew about the English ; how they ate their children and ignored the Blessed Virgin . How they committed suicide with unseemly cheerfulness . The English have the highest suicide rate in Europe . I got that straight from a priest . The English with their John Bull beef and frothing beer . The English who are even now waist - high in the waters off Kent practising to drown the best army in the world . We are to invade England . All France will be recruited if necessary . Bonaparte will snatch up his country like a sponge and wring out every last drop . We are in love with him . At Boulogne , though my hopes of drumming head high at the front of a proud column are dashed , I 'm

2900	2985	2888	2888	himself	108	' He held up the chicken for our inspection . I had hoped to stay in with the pocket Bible given to me by my mother as I left . My mother loved God , she said that God and the Virgin were all she needed though she was thankful for her family . I 've seen her kneeling before dawn , before the milking , before the thick porridge , and singing out loud to God , whom she has never seen . We 're
3117	3653	3116	3116	I	0	'm not interested in the still small voice . Surely a god can meet passion with passion ? She says he can . Then he should . My mother 's family were not wealthy but they were respectable . She was brought up quietly on music and suitable literature , and politics were never discussed at table , even when the rebels were breaking down the doors . Her family were monarchists . When she was twelve she told them that she wanted to be a nun , but they disliked excess and assured her that marriage would be more fulfilling . She grew in secret , away from their eyes . Outwardly she was obedient and loving , but inside she was feeding a hunger that would have disgusted them if disgust itself were not an excess . She read the lives of saints and knew most of the Bible off by heart . She believed that the Blessed Virgin herself would aid her when the time came . The time came when she was fifteen , at a cattle fair . Most of the town was out to see the lumbering bullocks and high - pitched sheep . Her mother and father were in holiday mood and in a rash moment her papa pointed to a stout , well - dressed man carrying a child on his shoulders . He said she could n't do better for a husband . He would be dining with them later and very much hoped that Georgette ( my mother ) would sing after supper . When the crowd thickened my mother made her escape , taking nothing with her but the clothes she stood in and her Bible that she always carried . She hid in a haycart and set off that sunburnt evening out of the town and slowly through the quiet country until the cart reached the village of my birth . Quite without fear , because she believed in the power of the Virgin , my mother presented herself to Claude ( my father ) and asked to be taken to the nearest convent . He was a slow - witted but kindly man , ten years older than her , and he offered her a bed for the night , 10 THE EMPEROR thinking to take her home the next day and maybe collect a reward . She never went home and she never found the convent either . The days turned into weeks and she was afraid of her father , who she heard was scouring the area and leaving bribes at any religious houses he passed . Three months went by and she discovered that she had a way with plants and that she could quiet frightened animals . Claude hardly ever spoke to her and never bothered her , but sometimes she would catch him watching her , standing still with his hand shading his eyes . One night , late , as she slept , she heard a tapping at the door and turning up her lamp saw Claude in the doorway . He had shaved , he was wearing his nightshirt and he smelled of carbolic soap . '
3661	4136	3655	3655	you	323	' She shook her head and he went away , returning now and again as time continued , always standing by the door , clean shaven and smelling of soap . She said yes . She could n't go home . She could n't go to a convent so long as her father was bribing every Mother Superior with a mind to a new altar piece , but she could n't go on living with this quiet man and his talkative neighbours unless he married her . He got into bed beside her and stroked her face and taking her hand put it to his face . She was not afraid . She believed in the power of the Virgin . After that , whenever he wanted her , he tapped at the door in just the same way and waited until she said yes . Then I was born . She told me about my grandparents and their house and their piano , and a shadow crossed her eyes when she thought I would never see them , but I liked my anonymity . Everyone else in the village had strings of relations to pick fights with and know about . I made up stories about mine . They were whatever I wanted them to be depending on my mood . II THE PASSION a Thanks to my mother 's efforts and the rusty scholarliness of our priest I learned to read in my own language , Latin and English and I learned arithmetic , the rudiments of first aid and because the priest also supplemented his meagre income by betting and gambling I learned every card game and a few tricks . I never told my mother that the priest had a hollow Bible with a pack of cards inside . Sometimes he took it to our service by mistake and then the reading was always from the first chapter of Genesis . The villagers thought he loved the creation story . He was a good man but lukewarm . I would have preferred a burning Jesuit , perhaps then I might have found the extasy I need to believe . I asked him why he was a priest , and he said if you have to work for anybody an absentee boss is best . We fished together and he pointed out the girls he wanted and asked me to do it for him . I never did . I came to women late like my father . When I left , Mother did n't cry . It was Claude who cried . She gave me her little Bible , the one that she had kept for so many years , and I promised her I would read it . The cook saw my hesitation and poked me with a skewer . '
4165	4264	4148	4149	These girls	325	' I got ready , washing myself all over with carbolic soap . Bonaparte , the Corsican . Born in 1769 , a Leo . Short , pale , moody , with an eye to the future and a singular ability to concentrate . In 1789 revolution opened a closed world and for a time the meanest street boy had more on his side than any aristocrat . For a young Lieutenant skilled in artillery , the chances were kind and in a few years General Bonaparte was turning Italy into the fields of France . 12 THE EMPEROR '
4268	4273	4148	4149	These girls	325	' , he said , '
4281	4522	4148	4149	These girls	325	' He believed he was the centre of the world and for a long time there was nothing to change him from this belief . Not even John Bull . He was in love with himself and France joined in . It was a romance . Perhaps all romance is like that ; not a contract between equal parties but an explosion of dreams and desires that can find no outlet in everyday life . Only a drama will do and while the fireworks last the sky is a different colour . He became an Emperor . He called the Pope from the Holy City to crown him but at the last second he took the crown in his own hands and placed it on his own head . He divorced the only person who understood him , the only person he ever really loved , because she could n't give him a child . That was the only part of the romance he could n't manage by himself . He is repulsive and fascinating by turns . What would you do if you were an Emperor ? Would soldiers become numbers ? Would battles become diagrams ? Would intellectuals become a threat ? Would you end your days on an island where the food is salty and the company bland ? He was the most powerful man in the world and he could n't beat Joséphine at billiards . I 'm

5010	5052	5054	5054	your	341	' I saw her lip curl and the red mark on her cheek glowed despite her rough skin . She did n't answer , just poked her hand into his trousers and brought it out like a ferret by the neck . '

Then he came with a great bellow and flopped backwards on his elbows . His woman got up and very deliberately spat in the bowl on the floor , then rinsed her mouth with wine and spat that out too . She was noisy and the cook heard and asked her what she was doing throwing his sperm to the sewers of France . '
5171	5301	5166	5166	I	0	' He came towards her with his fist raised but it never fell . My woman stepped forward and coshed him on the back of the head with a wine jar . She held her companion for a moment and kissed her swiftly on the forehead . She would never do that to me . I told her I had a headache and went to sit outside . We carried our leader home taking turns in fours to bear him like a coffin on our shoulders , face down in case he vomited . In the morning he swaggered over to the officers and boasted how he 'd made the bitch swallow him whole and how her cheeks had filled out like a rat 's when she took him . '

5317	5866	5867	5867	Christ	129	' he said , looking at me . a He went out whoring most nights but I never went with him again . Apart from Domino and Patrick , the de - frocked priest with the eagle eye , I hardly spoke to anyone . I spent my time learning how to stuff a chicken and slow down the cooking process . I was waiting for Bonaparte . At last , on a hot morning when the sea left salt craters in between the dock stones , he came . He came with his Generals Murat and Bernadotte . He came with his new Admiral of the Fleet . He came with his wife , whose grace made the roughest in the camp polish his boots twice . But I saw no one but him . For years , my mentor , the priest who had supported the Revolution , told me that Bonaparte was perhaps the Son of God come again . I learned his battles and campaigns instead of 15 THE PASSION history and geography . I have lain with the priest on an old and impossibly folded map of the world looking at the places he had gone and watching the frontiers of France push slowly out . The priest carried a drawing of Bonaparte next to his drawing of the Blessed Virgin and I grew up with both , unknown to my mother , who remained a monarchist and who still prayed for the soul of Marie Antoinette . I was only five when the Revolution turned Paris into a free man 's city and France into the scourge of Europe . Our village was not very far down the Seine , but we might have been living on the moon . No one really knew what was happening except that King and Queen were imprisoned . We relied on gossip , but the priest crept back and forth relying on his cloth to save him from the cannon or the knife . The village was divided . Most felt King and Queen are right though King and Queen had no care for us , except as revenue and scenery . But these are my words , taught to me by a clever man who was no respecter of persons . For the most part , my friends in the village could not speak of their unease , but I saw it in their shoulders as they rounded up the cattle , saw it in their faces as they listened to the priest in church . We were always helpless , whoever was in power . The priest said we were living in the last days , that the Revolution would bring forth a new Messiah and the millennium on earth . He never went as far as that in church . He told me . Not the others . Not Claude with his pails , not Jacques in the dark with his sweetheart , not my mother with her prayers . He . took me on his knees , holding me against the black cloth that smelled of age and hay , and told me not to be afraid of rumours in our village that everyone in Paris was either starving or dead .

In my rage I filled up the largest fish - kettle I could and poured cold water all over the cook . He did n't stir . An hour later , when the birds were staggered on the spits to cook in their turn , the Captain came back very agitated and told me that Bonaparte wanted to inspect the kitchens . It was always a feature of his to interest himself in every detail of his army , but this was inconvenient . '
6224	6354	6357	6357	he	359	' ordered the Captain as he left . The cook weighed around 200 lbs , I was scarcely 120 . I tried raising his upper body and dragging him , but I could only manage a helpless shuffle . If I had been a prophet and this cook the heathen agent of a false god I could have prayed to the Lord and had a host of angels move him . As it was , Domino came to my aid with some talk about Egypt . I knew about Egypt because Bonaparte had been there . His Egyptian campaign , doomed but brave , where he had remained 17 THE PASSION immune from the plague and the fever and ridden miles in the dust without a drop of water . '
6359	6365	6357	6357	he	359	' the priest had said , '
6374	6418	6372	6372	God	110	' It was Domino 's plan to raise the cook the way the Egyptians raised their obelisks , with a fulcrum , in our case an oar . We levered the oar under his back , then dug a pit at his feet . '

6468	6477	6455	6455	I	0	' What do we do now , Domino ? '
6479	6552	6553	6554	The cook	273	' While we stood on either side of this mound of flesh , the tent flap parted and the Captain strode in , very proper . Colour drained from his face as though someone had pulled a plug in his throat . He opened his mouth and his moustache moved but that was all . Pushing past him was Bonaparte . He walked twice round our exhibit and asked who he was . ‘
6571	6655	6565	6566	These men	365	' I was desperate to get to the spit where one of the chickens was already burning , but Domino stepped in front of me and , speaking in a rough language he later told me was Bonaparte 's Corsican dialect , he somehow explained what had happened and how we had done our best on the lines of his Egyptian campaign . When Domino had done , Bonaparte came towards me and pinched my ear so that it was swollen for days . '
6661	6665	6659	6659	Captain	367	' he said , '
6684	6696	6697	6697	You	366	' The Captain smiled weakly , then Bonaparte turned to me . '
6762	6845	6754	6754	Domino	117	' I wrote to my friend the priest straight away . This was more perfect than any ordinary miracle . I had been chosen . I did n't foresee that the cook would become my sworn enemy . By nightfall most of the camp had heard the story and had embroidered it , so that we had buried the cook in a trench , beaten him unconscious , or most bizarre of all , that Domino had worked a spell on him . '
6852	6865	6848	6848	I	0	' he said . " We could have saved ourselves the digging . '

6974	6978	6980	6980	Domino	117	' Forget him , '
7399	7434	7398	7398	We	378	're not like that in France , we welcome our children . Domino told me that we were rumoured to be digging a tunnel ready to pop up like moles in the Kentish fields . '
7449	7668	7398	7398	We	378	' Other stories concerned a balloon landing , a man - firing cannon and a plan to blow up the Houses of Parliament just as Guy Fawkes had nearly done . The balloon landing was the one the English were taking the most seriously and , to prevent us , they built tall towers along the Cinque Ports , to spot us and to shoot us down . 20 THE EMPEROR All folly , but I think if Bonaparte had asked us to strap on wings and fly to St James 's Palace we would have set off as confidently as a child lets loose a kite . Without him , during nights and days when affairs of state took him back to Paris , our nights and days were different only in the amount of light they let in . For myself , with no one to love , a hedgehog spirit seemed best and I hid my heart in the leaves . а I have a way with priests , so it came as no surprise that along with Domino , my friend should be Patrick , the de - frocked priest with the eagle eye , imported from Ireland . In 1799 , when Napoleon was still vying for power , General Hoche , a schoolboys '
7819	8066	7806	7806	Hoche	136	' tales , but soon found that the women were wiser than he . Though Patrick at first denied the charge and the men laughed and said women and their fantasies , the women looked at the earth and said they knew when they were being watched . The Bishop had taken them seriously , not because he believed the talk about Patrick 's eye , but preferring the smooth shapes of his choirboys he found the affair exceedingly repulsive . A priest should have better things to do than look at women . Hoche , caught in this web of hearsay , took Patrick drinking 21 THE PASSION a till the man could hardly stand , then half - walked , half - carried him to a hillock that afforded a clear view across the valley for some miles . They sat together and , while Patrick dozed , Hoche pulled out a red flag and waved it for a couple of minutes . Then a nudging Patrick awake he commented , as one would , on the splendid evening and the beautiful scenery . Out of courtesy to his host Patrick forced himself to follow the sweep of Hoche 's arm , muttering something about the Irish having been blessed with their portion of paradise on earth . Then he propped himself forward , screwed up one eye , and in a voice as hushed and holy as the Bishop 's at communion said , '
8074	8075	8068	8068	you	421	' '
8082	8083	8089	8089	she	422	' '
8099	8443	8089	8089	she	422	' Hoche could see nothing , but he knew what Patrick could see . He had paid a tart to undress in a field some fifteen miles away , and placed his men at regular intervals with their red flags . When he left for France he took Patrick with him . At Boulogne , Patrick was usually to be found , like Simeon Stylites , on the top of a purpose - built pillar . From there he could look out across the Channel and report on the whereabouts of Nelson 's blockading fleet and warn our practising troops of any English threat . French boats that strayed too far out of the harbour radius were likely to be picked off with a sharp broadside if the English were in the mood for patrolling . In order to alert us , Patrick had been given an Alpine horn as tall as a man . On foggy nights this melancholy sound resounded as far as the Dover cliffs , fuelling the rumour that Bonaparte had hired the Devil himself as a look - out . How did he feel about working for the French ? He preferred it to working for the English . Without Bonaparte to care for I spent much of my time with Patrick on the pillar . The top of it was about twenty feet by 22 THE EMPEROR fifteen , so there was room to play cards . Sometimes Domino came up for a boxing match . His unusual height was no disadvantage to him and , although Patrick had fists like cannonballs , he never once landed a blow on Domino , whose tactic was to jump about until his opponent started to tire . Judging his moment , Domino hit once and once only , not with his fists but with both feet , hurling himself sideways or backwards or pushing off from a lightning handstand . These were playful matches , but I 've seen him fell an ox simply by leaping at its forehead . '
8471	8992	8469	8469	others	424	' Looking out from the pillar I let Patrick describe to me the activity on deck beneath the English sails . He could see the Admirals in their white leggings and the sailors running up and down the rigging , altering the sail to make the most of the wind . There were plenty of floggings . Patrick said he saw a man 's back lifted off in one clean piece . They dipped him in the sea to save him from turning septic and left him on deck staring at the sun . Patrick said he could see the weevils in the bread . Do n't believe that one . July 20th , 1804 . Too early for dawn but not night either . There 's a restlessness in the trees , out at sea , in the camp . The birds and we are sleeping fitfully , wanting to be asleep but tense with the idea of awakening . In maybe half an hour , that familiar cold grey light . Then the sun . Then the seagulls crying out over the water . I get up at this time most days . I walk down to the port to watch the ships tethered like dogs . I wait for the sun to slash the water . The last nineteen days have been millpond days . We have dried our clothes on the burning stones not pegged them up to the wind , but today my shirt - sleeves are whipping round my arms and the ships are listing badly . We are on parade today . Bonaparte arrives in a couple of O . 23 THE PASSION hours to watch us put out to sea . He wants to launch 25,000 men in fifteen minutes . He will . This sudden weather is unexpected . If it worsens it will be impossible to risk the Channel . Patrick says the Channel is full of mermaids . He says it 's the mermaids lonely for a man that pull so many of us down . Watching the white crests slapping against the sides of the ships , I wonder if this mischief storm is their doing ? Optimistically , it may pass . Noon . The rain is running off our noses down our jackets into our boots . To talk to the next man I have to cup my hands around my mouth . The wind has already loosened scores of barges , forcing men out chest deep into the impossible waters , making a nonsense of our best knots . The officers say we ca n't risk a practice today . Bonaparte , with his coat pulled round his head , says we can . We will . July 20th , 1804 . Two thousand men were drowned today . In gales so strong that Patrick as look - out had to be tied to barrels of apples , we discovered that our barges are children 's toys after all .

I lay next to Patrick , flat and strapped , hardly seeing at all for the spray , but every gap the wind left showed me another gap where a boat had been . The mermaids wo n't be lonely any more . We should have turned on him , should have laughed in his face , should have shook the dead - men - seaweed - hair in his face . a 24 THE EMPEROR But his face is always pleading with us to prove him right . At night when the storm had dropped and we were left in sodden tents with steaming bowls of coffee , none of us spoke out . No one said , Let 's leave him , let 's hate him . We held our bowls in both hands and drank our coffee with the brandy ration he 'd sent specially to every man . I had to serve him that night and his smile pushed away the madness of arms and legs that pushed in at my ears and mouth . I was covered in dead men . In the morning , 2,000 new recruits marched into Boulogne . Do you ever think of your childhood ? I think of it when I smell porridge . Sometimes after I 've been by the docks I walk into town and use my nose tracking fresh bread and bacon . Always , passing a particular house , that sits like the others in a sort of row , and is the same as them , I smell the slow smell of oats . Sweet but with an edge of salt . Thick like a blanket . I do n't know who lives in the house , who is responsible , but I imagine the yellow fire and the black pot . At home we used a copper pot that I polished , loving to polish anything that would keep a shine . My mother made porridge , leaving the oats overnight by the old fire . Then in the morning when her bellows work had sent the sparks shooting up the chimney , she burned the oats brown at the sides , so that the sides were like brown paper lining the pot and the inside slopped white over the edge . We trod on a flag floor but in the winter she put down hay and the hay and the oats made us smell like a manger . Most of my friends ate hot bread in the mornings . . I was happy but happy is an adult word . You do n't have to ask a child about happy , you see it . They are or they are not . Adults talk about being happy because largely they are not . Talking about it is the same as trying to catch the wind . Much 25 THE PASSION easier to let it blow all over you . This is where I disagree with the philosophers . They talk about passionate things but there is no passion in them . Never talk happiness with a philosopher . But I 'm

We think of their bodies and now and then we talk about home but we do n't think of them as they are ; the most solid , the best loved , the well known . They go on . Whatever we do or undo , they go on . . There was a man in our village who liked to think of himself as an inventor . He spent a lot of time with pulleys and bits of rope and offcuts of wood making devices that could raise a cow or laying pipes to bring the river water right into the house . He was a man with light in his voice and an easy way with his neighbours . Used to disappointment , he could always assuage the disappointment in others . And in a village subject to the rain and sun there are many disappointments . All the while that he invented and re - invented and cheered us up , his wife , who never spoke except to say , '
10253	10477	10038	10038	her	1852	' , worked in the fields and kept house and , because the man liked his bed , she was soon bringing up six children too . Once , he went to town for a few months to try and make his fortune and when he came back with no fortune and without their savings , she was sitting quietly in a clean house mending clean clothes and the fields were planted for another year . 27 THE PASSION You can tell I liked this man , and I 'd be a fool to say he did n't а work , that we did n't need him and his optimistic ways . But when she died , suddenly , at noon , the light went out of his voice and his pipes filled with mud and he could hardly harvest his land let alone bring up six children . She had made him possible . In that sense she was his god . Like God , she was neglected . a New recruits cry when they come here and they think about their mothers and their sweethearts and they think about going home .

A past filled with sequined women and doubletailed horses and a father who made his living being fired from a cannon . He came from somewhere in eastern Europe and his skin was the colour of old olives . We only knew he had wandered into France by mistake , years ago , and saved the lady Joséphine from the hooves of a runaway horse . She was plain Madame Beauharnais then , recently out of the slimy prison of Carmes and recently widowed . Her husband had been executed in the Terror ; she had only escaped because Robespierre was murdered on the morning she was to follow him . Domino called her a lady of good sense and claimed that in her penniless days a she had challenged officers to play her at billiards . If she lost , they could stay to breakfast . If she won , they were to pay one of her more pressing bills . She never lost . Years later , she had recommended Domino to her husband eager for a groom he could keep and they had found him eating fire in some sideshow . His loyalties to Bonaparte were mixed , but he loved both Joséphine and the horses . He told me about the fortune tellers he 'd known and how crowds came every week to have their future opened or their past revealed . “ But I tell you , Henri , that every moment you steal from the present is a moment you have lost for ever . There 's only now . '

I went from home to home gossiping and seeing friends , helping with whatever had to be mended or gathered .

12819	13535	12818	12818	I	0	'm going again . I have promised my mother that she will come to Paris soon after the Coronation . I 've never been myself and it 's the thought of that that makes it easier for me to say goodbye . Domino will be there grooming his preposterous horse , teaching the mad beast to walk in a quiet line with Court animals . Why Bonaparte 33 THE PASSION has insisted on having that horse present at such an important time is not clear . It 's a soldier 's mount , not a creature for parades . But he 's always reminding us that he 's a soldier too . When Claude had finally gone to bed and we were alone , we did n't talk . We held hands until the wick burnt out and then we were in the dark . Paris had never seen so much money . The Bonapartes were ordering everything from cream to David . David , who had flattered Napoleon by calling his head perfectly Roman , was given the commission to paint the Coronation , and he was to be found each day at Notre - Dame making cartoons and arguing with the workmen who were trying to do away with the ravages of revolution and bankruptcy . Joséphine , given charge of the flowers , had not contented herself with vases and arrangements . She had drawn up a plan of the route to the cathedral from the palace and was engaged as intently as David on her own ephemeral masterpiece . I first encountered her over the billiard table , where she was playing Monsieur Talleyrand , a gentleman not gifted with balls . In spite of her dress , which spread out would easily have made a carpet all the way to the cathedral , she bent and moved as though she wore nothing at all , making beautiful parallel lines with her cue . Bonaparte had dressed me up as a footman and ordered me to take her Highness an afternoon snack . She was fond of melon at four o'clock . Monsieur Talleyrand was to have port . This holiday mood of Napoleon 's was almost a madness . He had appeared at dinner two nights ago dressed as the Pontiff and lewdly asked Joséphine how intimate she would like to be with God . I stared into the chicken . Now , he had me out of my soldier 's uniform and in Court dress . Impossibly tight . It made him laugh . He liked to laugh . It was his only relaxation apart from those hotter and hotter baths he took at any time of the day or night . In the palace the 34 THE EMPEROR a bathroom staff lived in the same state of unrest as the kitchen staff . He might cry out for hot water at any moment , and woe betide the man on duty if the tub were not just full , just so . I 'd only seen the bathroom once . A great big room with a tub the size of a line - ship and a huge furnace in one corner , where the water was heated and drawn and poured back and reheated over and over again until the moment came and he wanted it . The attendants were specially chosen from amongst the best oxwrestlers in France . Fellows who could handle the copper kettles like tea - cups worked alone , stripped to the waist , wearing only sailor 's breeches that caught the sweat and held it in dark stripes down each leg . Like sailors they had their liquor ration , but I do n't know what it was made of . The biggest , André , offered me a swig from his flask the time I poked my head round the door , gasping at the steam and this huge man who looked like a genie . I accepted out of politeness , but spat the brown stuff over the tiles , frantic at the heat . He pinched my arm the way the cook pinched spaghetti strings and told me that the hotter it is the hotter the liquid you drink . '
13548	13580	13538	13538	you	552	' and he winked broadly , imitating her Highness 's walk . Now , here she was before me and I was too shy to announce the melon . Talleyrand coughed . '

13818	14972	14975	14975	I	0	' hall , where I had a little room of my own ; the privilege of being a special attendant . I kept my few books there , a flute I was hoping to learn and my journal . I wrote about her or tried to . She eluded me the way the tarts in Boulogne had eluded me . I decided to write about Napoleon instead . After that , I was kept busy with banquet after banquet as all our conquered territories came to congratulate the Emperor to be . While the guests filled themselves on rare fish and veal in newly invented sauces , he kept to his chicken , eating a whole one every night , usually forgetting about the vegetables . No one ever mentioned it . He only needed to cough and the table fell silent . Now and again I caught her Majesty watching me , but if our eyes met , she smiled in that half way of hers and I dropped my eyes . Even to look at her was to wrong him . She belonged to him . I envied her that . In the weeks that followed he grew morbidly afraid of being poisoned or assassinated , not for himself , but because the future of France was at stake . He had me taste all his food before he would touch it and he doubled his guard . Rumour had it that he even checked his bed before he slept . Not that he slept much . He was like a dog , he could close his eyes and snore in a moment , but when his mind was full he was able to stay awake for days while his Generals and friends dropped around him . Abruptly , at the end of November and only two weeks from 36 THE EMPEROR his Coronation , he ordered me back to Boulogne . He said I lacked a real soldier 's training , that I would serve him better when I could handle a musket as well as a carving knife . Perhaps he saw how I blushed , perhaps he knew my feelings , he knew those of most people . He tweaked my ear in his maddening way and promised there was a special job for me in the New Year . So I left the city of dreams just as it was about to flower and heard second - hand reports of that gaudy morning when Napoleon had taken the crown from the Pope and placed it on his own head before crowning Joséphine . They say that he bought Madame Clicquot 's entire stock for the whole year . With her husband lately dead and the whole weight of the business on her shoulders , she can only have blessed the return of a King . She was not alone . Paris threw open every door and lit every chandelier for three days . Only the old and ill bothered to go to bed , for the rest it was drunkenness and madness and joy . ( I exclude the aristocrats , but they are not relevant . ) In Boulogne , in the terrible weather , I trained for ten hours a day and collapsed at night in a damp bivouac with a couple of inadequate blankets . Our supplies and conditions had always been good , but in my absence thousands more men had joined up , believing through the offices of Napoleon 's fervent clergy that the road to Heaven was first the road to Boulogne . No one was exempt from conscription . It was up to the recruiting officers to decide who should stay and who must go . By Christmas , the camp had swelled to over 100,000 men and more were expected . We ran with packs that weighed around 40 lbs , waded in and out of the sea , fought one another hand to hand and used all the available farming land to feed ourselves . Even so , it was not enough and , in spite of Napoleon 's dislike of supply contractors , we got most of our meat from nameless regions and I suspect from animals that Adam would not recognise . Two pounds of bread , 4 oz of meat and 4 oz of vegetables were rationed to us daily . We stole what we could , spent our wages , when we had 37 THE PASSION them , on tavern food and wreaked havoc on the communities who lived quietly round about . Napoleon himself ordered vivandières to be sent to special camps . Vivandière is an optimistic army word . He sent tarts who had no reason to be vivant about anything . Their food was often worse than ours , they had us as many hours of the day as we could stand and the pay was poor . The well - padded town tarts took pity on them and were often to be seen visiting the camps with blankets and loaves of bread . The vivandières were runaways , strays , younger daughters of too - large families , servant girls who 'd got tired of giving it away to drunken masters , and fat old dames who could n't ply their trade anywhere else . On arrival they were each given a set of underclothes and a dress that chilled their bosoms in the icy sea - salt days . Shawls were distributed too , but any woman found covering herself on duty could be reported and fined . Fined meant no money that week instead of hardly any money . Unlike the town tarts , who protected themselves and charged what they liked and certainly charged individually , the vivants were expected to service as many men as asked them day or night . One woman I met crawling home after an officer 's party said she 'd lost count at thirty - nine . Christ lost consciousness at thirty - nine . Most of us that winter got great sores where the salt and wind had rubbed down our skin . Sores between our toes and on our top lips were the most common . A moustache did n't help , the hairs aggravated the rawness . At Christmas , though the vivandières had no time off , we did , and we sat around our fires with extra logs toasting the Emperor with our extra brandy . Patrick and I feasted on a goose I stole , cooking and eating it in guilty joy on top of his pillar . We should have shared it , but as it was we were still hungry . He told me stories about Ireland , about the peat fires and the goblins that live under every hill . 38 THE EMPEROR '

It was filling slowly with men and women from the town , muffled against the cold but in the best clothes they could find . We were the only ones from the camp . Probably the only ones still sober in this desperate weather . The church was plain except for the coloured windows and the statue of the Queen of Heaven decked in red robes . Despite myself I made her a little bow and Patrick , catching me , smiled his crooked smile . We sang with our strongest voices and the warmth and nearness of other people thawed my unbeliever 's heart and I too saw God through the frost . The plain windows were trellised with frost and the stone floor that received our knees had the coldness of the grave . The oldest were dignified with smiling faces and the children , some of whom were so poor that they kept their hands warm in bandages , grew angel hair . The Queen of Heaven looked down . When we had put aside our stained prayer books that only some of us could read we took communion with clean hearts , and Patrick , who had clipped his moustache , whipped to the end of the queue and managed to receive the host twice . 41 THE PASSION ‘
16230	16985	15967	15968	my friend	2059	' he whispered to me . I had not intended to take communion at all , but my longing for strong arms and certainty and the quiet holiness around me forced me to my feet and down the aisle where strangers met my eyes as though I had been their son . Kneeling , with the incense making me light - headed and the slow repetition of the priest calming my banging heart , I thought again about a life with God , thought of my mother , who would now be kneeling too , far away and cupping her hands for her portion of the Kingdom . In my village , each house would be empty and silent but the barn would be full . Full of honest people who had no church making a church out of themselves . Their flesh and blood . The patient cattle sleep . I took the wafer on my tongue and it burned my tongue . The wine tasted of dead men , 2,000 dead men . In the face of the priest I saw dead men accusing me . I saw tents sodden at dawn . I saw women with blue breasts . I gripped the chalice , though I could feel the priest try and take it from me . I gripped the chalice . When the priest gently curled away my fingers I saw the imprint of the silver on each palm . Were these my stigmata then ? Would I bleed for every death and living death ? If a soldier did , there would be no soldiers left . We would go under the hill with the goblins . We would marry the mermaids . We would never leave our homes . I left Patrick at his second communion and went out into the freezing night . It was not yet twelve . No bells were ringing , no flares were lit , heralding a new year and praising God and the Emperor . This year is I told myself . This year is slipping away and it will never return . Domino 's right , there 's only now . Forget it . Forget it . You ca n't bring it back . You ca n't bring them back . They say that every snowflake is different . If that were true , is gone , 42 THE EMPEROR how could the world go on ? How could we ever get up off our knees ? How could we ever recover from the wonder of it ? By forgetting . We can not keep in mind too many things . There is only the present and nothing to remember . 1 On the flagstones , still visible under a coating of ice , some child had scrawled a game of noughts and crosses in red tailor 's chalk . You play , you win , you play , you lose . You play . It 's the playing that 's irresistible . Dicing from one year to the next with the things you love , what you risk reveals what you value . I sat down and scratching in the ice drew my own square of innocent noughts and angry crosses . Perhaps the Devil would partner me . Perhaps the Queen of Heaven . Napoleon , Joséphine . Does it matter whom you lose to , if you lose ? From the church came the roar of the last hymn . Not heard as half - hearted hymns are heard on monotonous Sundays when the congregation would rather be in bed or with their sweethearts . This was no lukewarm appeal to an exacting God but love and confidence that hung in the rafters , pushed open the church door , forced the cold from the stone , forced the stones to cry out . The church vibrated . My soul doth magnify the Lord . What gave them this joy ? What made cold and hungry people so sure that another year could only be better ? Was it Him , Him on the throne ? Their little Lord in his simple uniform ? What does it matter ? Why do I question what I see to be real ? Down the street towards me comes a woman with wild hair , her boots making sparks orange against the ice . She 's laughing . She 's holding a baby very close . She comes straight to me . ‘
16992	17365	16990	16990	soldier	591	' Her baby is wide awake with clear blue eyes and curious fingers that move from buttons to nose to stretch at me . I wrap 43 THE PASSION my arms around them both and we make a strange shape swaying slightly near the wall . The hymn is over and the moment of silence takes me by surprise . The baby burps . Then the flares go out across the Channel and a great cheer from our camp two miles away comes clearly to where we stand . The woman pulls away , kisses me and disappears with her sparking heels . Queen of Heaven , go with her . Here they come , with the Lord sewn in their hearts for another year . Arm in arm , huddled together , some running , some walking with long strides like wedding guests . The priest is at the door of the church , standing in a pool of light and beside him , the altar boys in their scarlet , shelter the holy candles from the wind . From across the street where I am standing I can see through the door , down the aisle and up to the altar . The church is empty now , except for Patrick , who is standing with his back to me right up against the altar rail . By the time he comes out , the bells are ringing crazily and at least a dozen women whom I 've never met have thrown their arms around my neck and blessed me . Most of the men are in groups of five or six , still by the church , but the women are joining hands and making a great circle that blocks the road and fills the space from one side of the street to the other . They start to dance , going round and round faster and faster until my eyes are dizzy with keeping up with them . I do n't recognise their song but their voices are full . Sequester my heart . Wherever love is , I want to be , I will follow it as surely as the land - locked salmon finds the sea . ‘

17428	18987	17419	17419	They	594	' We walked the miles back to the camp , meeting a band of soldiers carrying one who 'd thrown himself into the sea as a New Year gesture . He was n't dead , but he was too cold to speak . They were taking him to a brothel to get warm . Soldiers and women . That 's how the world is . Any other role is temporary . Any other role is a gesture . We slept in the kitchen tent that night as a concession to the unimaginable zero temperature . Unfeelable too . The body shuts down when it has too much to bear ; goes its own way quietly inside , waiting for a better time , leaving you numb and half alive . With frosty bodies all about us , drunken men sleeping off another year , we finished the wine and the brandy and shoved our feet under the potato sacks , boots off , but nothing else . I listened to Patrick 's regular breathing choke into a snore . He was lost in his world of goblins and treasure , always sure that he would find treasure , even if it was only a bottle of claret from behind the altar . Perhaps the Queen of Heaven did care for him . I lay awake till the seagulls began to cry . It was New Year 's Day , 1805 , and I was twenty . 45 2 : the Queen of Spades There is a city surrounded by water with watery alleys that do for streets and roads and silted up back ways that only the rats can cross . Miss your way , which is easy to do , and you may find yourself staring at a hundred eyes guarding a filthy palace of sacks and bones . Find your way , which is easy to do , and you may meet an old woman in a doorway . She will tell your fortune , depending on your face . This is the city of mazes . You may set off from the same place to the same place every day and never go by the same route . If you do so , it will be by mistake . Your bloodhound nose will not serve you here . Your course in compass reading will fail you . Your confident instructions to passers - by will send them to squares they have never heard of , over canals not listed in the notes . Although wherever you are going is always in front of you , there is no such thing as straight ahead . No as the crow flies short cut will help you to reach the café just over the water . The short cuts are where the cats go , through the impossible gaps , round corners that seem to take you the opposite way . But here , in this mercurial city , it is required you do awake your faith . With faith , all things are possible . Rumour has it that the inhabitants of this city walk on water . That , more bizarre still , their feet are webbed . Not all feet , but the feet of the boatmen whose trade is hereditary . This is the legend . When a boatman 's wife finds herself pregnant she waits until the moon is full and the night empty of idlers . Then she takes her husband 's boat and rows to a terrible island where the dead are buried . She leaves her boat with rosemary in the bows so that the limbless ones can not return with her and hurries to the 49 THE PASSION a grave of the most recently dead in her family . She has brought her offerings : a flask of wine , a lock of hair from her husband and a silver coin . She must leave the offerings on the grave and beg for a clean heart if her child be a girl and boatman 's feet if her child be a boy . There is no time to lose . She must be home before dawn and the boat must be left for a day and a night covered in salt . In this way , the boatmen keep their secrets and their trade . No newcomer can compete . And no boatman will take off his boots , no matter how you bribe him . I have seen tourists throw diamonds to the fish , but I have never seen a boatman take off his boots . There was once a weak and foolish man whose wife cleaned the boat and sold the fish and brought up their children and went to the terrible island as she should when her yearly time was due . Their house was hot in summer and cold in winter and there was too little food and too many mouths . This boatman , ferrying a tourist from one church to another , happened to fall into conversation with the man and the man brought up the question of the webbed feet . At the same time he drew a purse of gold from his pocket and let it lie quietly in the bottom of the boat . Winter was approaching , the boatman was thin and he thought what harm could it do to unlace just one boot and let this visitor see what there was . The next morning , the boat was picked up by a couple of priests on their way to Mass. The tourist was babbling incoherently and pulling at his toes with his fingers . There was no boatman . They took the tourist to the madhouse , San Servelo , a quiet place that caters for the well - off and defective . For all I know , he 's still there . And the boatman ? He was my father . I never knew him because I was n't born when he disappeared . A few weeks after my mother had been left with an empty boat she discovered she was pregnant . Although her future was uncertain and she was n't strictly speaking married to a boatman 50 THE QUEEN OF SPADES any more , she decided to go ahead with the gloomy ritual , and on the appropriate night she rowed her way silently across the lagoon . As she fastened the boat , an owl flew very low and caught her on the shoulder with its wing . She was not hurt but she cried out and stepped back and , as she did so , dropped the sprig of rosemary into the sea . For a moment she thought of returning straight away but , crossing herself , she hurried to her father 's grave and placed her offerings . She knew her husband should have been the one , but he had no grave . How like him , she thought , to be as absent in death as he was in life . Her deed done , she pushed off from the shore that even the crabs avoided and later covered the boat in so much salt that it sank . The Blessed Virgin must have protected her . Even before I was born she had married again . This time , a prosperous baker who could afford to take Sundays off . The hour of my birth coincided with an eclipse of the sun and my mother did her best to slow down her labour until it had passed . But I was as impatient then as I am now and I forced my head out while the midwife was downstairs heating some milk . A fine head with a crop of red hair and a pair of eyes that made up for the sun 's eclipse . A girl . It was an easy birth and the midwife held me upside down by the ankles until I bawled . But it was when they spread me out to dry that my mother fainted and the midwife felt forced to open another bottle of wine . My feet were webbed . There never was a girl whose feet were webbed in the entire history of the boatmen . My mother in her swoon had visions of rosemary and blamed herself for her carelessness . Or perhaps it was her carefree pleasure with the baker she should blame herself for ? She had n't thought of my father since his boat had sunk . She had n't thought of him much while it was afloat . The midwife took out her knife with the thick blade and proposed 51 THE PASSION to cut off the offending parts straight away . My mother weakly nodded , imagining I would feel no pain or that pain for a moment would be better than embarrassment for a lifetime . The midwife tried to make an incision in the translucent triangle between my first two toes but her knife sprang from the skin leaving no mark . She tried again and again in between all the toes on each foot . She bent the point of the knife , but that was all . '

19681	19942	19943	19943	I	0	're here , with the odd bit of gold plate stuffed in a bag as they fled . So long as the Jews will buy the plate and the plate holds out , they survive . When you see the floating corpses belly upwards , you know the gold is ended . One woman who kept a fleet of boats and a string of cats and а 53 THE PASSION dealt in spices lives here now , in the silent city . I can not tell how old she may be , her hair is green with slime from the walls of the nook she lives in . She feeds on vegetable matter that snags against the stones when the tide is sluggish . She has no teeth . She has no need of teeth . She still wears the curtains that she dragged from her drawing - room window as she left . One curtain she wraps round herself and the other she drapes over her shoulders like a cloak . She sleeps like this . I 've spoken to her . When she hears a boat go by her head pokes out of her nook and she asks you what time of day it might be . Never what time it is ; she 's too much of a philosopher for that . I saw her once , at evening , her ghoulish hair lit by a lamp she has . She was spreading pieces of rancid meat on a cloth . There were wine goblets beside her . '

I went to work in the Casino , raking dice and spreading cards and lifting wallets where I could . There was a cellarful of champagne drunk every night and a cruel dog kept hungry to deal with anyone who could n't pay . I dressed as a boy because that 's what the visitors liked to see . It was part of the game , trying to decide which sex was hidden behind tight breeches and extravagant face - paste ... a It was August . Bonaparte 's birthday and a hot night . We were due for a celebration ball in the Piazza San Marco , though what we Venetians had to celebrate was not clear . In keeping with 54 THE QUEEN OF SPADES our customs , the ball was to be fancy dress and the Casino was arranging outdoor gaming tables and booths of chance . Our city swarmed with French and Austrian pleasure - seekers , the usual bewildered stream of English and even a party of Russians intent on finding satisfaction . Satisfying our guests is what we do best . The price is high but the pleasure is exact . I made up my lips with vermilion and overlaid my face with white powder . I had no need to add a beauty spot , having one of my own in just the right place . I wore my yellow Casino breeches with the stripe down each side of the leg and a pirate 's shirt that concealed my breasts . This was required , but the moustache I added was for my own amusement . And perhaps for my own protection . There are too many dark alleys and too many drunken hands on festival nights . Across our matchless square that Bonaparte had contemptuously called the finest drawing - room in Europe , our engineers had rigged a wooden frame alive with gunpowder . This was to be triggered at midnight and I was optimistic that , with so many heads looking up , so many pockets would be vulnerable . The ball began at eight o'clock and I began my night drawing cards in the booth of chance . Queen of spades you win , Ace of clubs you lose . Play again . What will you risk ? Your watch ? Your house ? Your mistress ? I like to smell the urgency on them . Even the calmest the richest , have that smell . It 's somewhere between fear and sex . Passion I suppose . There 's a man who comes to play Chance with me most nights at the Casino . A large man with pads of flesh on his palms like baker 's dough . When he squeezes my neck from behind , the sweat on his palms makes them squeak . I always carry a handkerchief . He wears a green waistcoat and I 've seen him stripped to that waistcoat because he ca n't let the dice roll without following it . He has funds . He must have . He spends in a moment what I earn in a month . He 's cunning though , for all his madness at the table . Most men wear their pockets or 55 THE PASSION their purses on their sleeves when they 're

I fan the cards before him ; close them , shuffle them , fan them again . He chooses . Too low to win . Choose again . Too high . Forfeit . He laughs and tosses a coin across the counter . '

22168	22545	22159	22159	Her	733	‘ Play again ? She shook her head and had a waiter bring over a bottle of champagne . Not any champagne . Madame Clicquot . The only good thing to come out of France . She held the glass in a silent toast , perhaps to her own good fortune . The Queen of spades is a serious win and one we are usually careful to avoid . Still she did not speak , but watched me through the crystal and suddenly draining her glass stroked the side of my face . Only for a second she touched me and then she was gone and I was left with my heart smashing at my chest and three - quarters of a bottle of the best champagne . I was careful to conceal both . I am pragmatic about love and have taken my pleasure with a a a O 59 THE PASSION both men and women , but I have never needed a guard for my heart . My heart is a reliable organ . a At midnight the gunpowder was triggered and the sky above St Mark 's broke into a million coloured pieces . The fireworks lasted perhaps half an hour and during that time I was able to finger enough money to bribe a friend to take over my booth for a while . I slipped through the press towards the still bubbling glass slipper looking for her . She had vanished . There were faces and dresses and masks and kisses to be had and a hand at every turn but she was not a there . I was detained by an infantryman who held up two glass balls and asked if I would exchange them for mine . But I was in no mood for charming games and pushed past him , my eyes begging for a sign . The roulette table . The gaming table . The fortune tellers . The fabulous three - breasted woman . The singing ape . The double - speed dominoes and the tarot . She was not there . She was nowhere . My time was up and I went back to the booth of chance full of champagne and an empty heart . ‘

22564	22736	22548	22549	a woman	312	' On the table was an earring . Roman by the look of it , curiously shaped , made of that distinct old yellow gold that these times do not know . I put it in my ear and , spreading the cards in a perfect fan , took out the Queen of spades . No one else should win tonight . I would keep her card until she needed it . Gaiety soon ages . By three o'clock the revellers were drifting away through the arches around St Mark 's or lying in piles by the cafés , opening 60 THE QUEEN OF SPADES early to provide strong coffee . The gaming was over . The Casino tellers were packing away their gaudy stripes and optimistic baize . I was off - duty and it was almost dawn . Usually , I go straight home and meet my stepfather on his way to the bakery . He slaps me about the shoulder and makes some joke about how much money I 'm

With this feeling inside , with this wild love that threatens , what safe places might there be ? Where do you store gunpowder ? How do you sleep at night again ? If I were a little different I might turn passion into something holy and then I would sleep again . And then my extasy would be my extasy but I would not be afraid .

The rush of it along my tongue and into my throat brought back other memories . Memories of a single touch . How could anything so passing be so pervasive ? But Christ said , '
23982	24089	24090	24090	I	0	' and it was done . Sunk in these dreams , I hardly felt his hand along my leg , his fingers on my belly . Then I was reminded vividly of squid and their suckers and I shook him off shouting that I 'd never marry him , not for all the Veuve Clicquot in France nor a Venice full of codpieces . His face was always red so it was hard to tell what he felt about these insults . He got up from where he 'd been kneeling and straightened his waistcoat . He asked me if I wanted to keep my job . '
24097	24112	24113	24113	He	792	'm good at it and clients like you come through the door every day . '
24180	24531	24532	24532	You	793	'm no heroine . I 'd nothing to lose either , having lost it already in happier times . He left a stain on my shirt and threw a coin at me by way of goodbye . 64 THE QUEEN OF SPADES What did I expect from a meat man ? I went back to the gaming floor . а November in Venice is the beginning of the catarrh season . Catarrh is part of our heritage like St Mark 's . Long ago , when , the Council of Three ruled in mysterious ways , any traitor or hapless one done away with was usually announced to have died of catarrh . In this way , no one was embarrassed . It 's the fog that rolls in from the lagoon and hides one end of the Piazza from another that brings on our hateful congestion . It rains too , mournfully and quietly , and the boatmen sit under sodden rags and stare helplessly into the canals . Such weather drives away the foreigners and that 's the only good thing that can be said of it . Even the brilliant water - gate at the Fenice turns grey . On an afternoon when the Casino did n't want me and I did n't want myself , I went to Florian 's to drink and gaze at the Square . It 's a fulfilling pastime . I had been sitting perhaps an hour when I had the feeling of being watched . There was no one near me , but there was someone behind a screen a little way off . I let my mind retreat again . What did it matter ? We are always watching or watched . The waiter came over to me with a packet in his hand . * I opened it . It was an earring . It was the pair . And she stood before me and I realised I was dressed as I had been that night because I was waiting to work . My hand went to my lip . '
24537	24985	24532	24532	You	793	' she said . I smiled . I could n't speak . She invited me to dine with her the following evening and I took her address and accepted . In the Casino that night I tried to decide what to do . She thought I was a young man . I was not . Should I go to see her as myself and joke about the mistake and leave gracefully ? My heart shrivelled at this thought . To lose her again so soon . And 1 65 THE PASSION what was myself ? Was this breeches and boots self any less real than my garters ? What was it about me that interested her ? You play , you win . You play , you lose . You play . I was careful to steal enough to buy a bottle of the best champagne . Lovers are not at their best when it matters . Mouths dry up , palms sweat , conversation flags and all the time the heart is threatening to fly from the body once and for all . Lovers have been known to have heart attacks . Lovers drink too much from nervousness and can not perform . They eat too little and faint during their fervently wished consummation . They do not stroke the favoured cat and their face - paint comes loose . This is not all . Whatever you have set store by , your dress , your dinner , your poetry , will go wrong . Her house was gracious , standing on a quiet waterway , fashionable but not vulgar . The drawing - room , enormous with great windows at either end and a fireplace that would have suited an idle wolfhound . It was simply furnished ; an oval table and a chaise - longue . A few Chinese ornaments that she liked to collect when the ships came through . She had also a strange assortment of dead insects mounted in cases on the wall . I had never seen such things before and wondered about this enthusiasm . She stood close to me as she took me through the house , pointing out certain pictures and books . Her hand guided my elbow at the stairs and when we sat down to eat she did not arrange us formally but put me beside her , the bottle in between . We talked about the opera and the theatre and the visitors and the weather and ourselves . I told her that my real father had been a boatman and she laughed and asked could it be true that we had webbed feet ? ‘
24989	25221	24532	24532	You	793	' I said and she laughed the more at this joke . 66 THE QUEEN OF SPADES . We had eaten . The bottle was empty . She said she had married late in life , had not expected to marry at all being stubborn and of independent means . Her husband dealt in rare books and manuscripts from the east . Ancient maps that showed the lairs of griffins and the haunts of whales . Treasure maps that claimed to know the whereabouts of the Holy Grail . He was a quiet and cultured man of whom she was fond . He was away . We had eaten , the bottle was empty . There was nothing more that could be said without strain or repetition . I had been with her more than five hours already and it was time to leave . As we stood up and she moved to get something I stretched out my arm , that was all , and she turned back into my arms so that my hands were on her shoulder blades and hers along my spine . We stayed thus for a few moments until I had courage enough to kiss her neck very lightly . She did not pull away . I grew bolder and kissed her mouth , biting a little at the lower lip . She kissed me . '
25230	25238	25222	25222	I	0	' she said . Relief and despair . ‘
25245	25665	25668	25668	myself	0	' And so , from the first , we separated our pleasure . She lay on , the rug and I lay at right angles to her so that only our lips might meet . Kissing in this way is the strangest of distractions . The greedy body that clamours for satisfaction is forced to content itself with a single sensation and , just as the blind hear more acutely and the deaf can feel the grass grow , so the mouth becomes the focus of love and all things pass through it and are re - defined . It is a sweet and precise torture . When I left her house some time later , I did not set off straight away , but watched her moving from room to room extinguishing the lights . Upwards she went , closing the dark behind her until there was only one light left and that was her own . She said she often read into the small hours while her husband was away . 67 THE PASSION Tonight she did not read . She paused briefly at the window and then the house was black . What was she thinking ? What was she feeling ? I walked slowly through the silent squares and across the Rialto , where the mist was brooding above the water . The boats were covered and empty apart from the cats that make their homes under the seat boards . There was no one , not even the beggars who fold themselves and their rags into any doorway . How is it that one day life is orderly and you are content , a little cynical perhaps but on the whole just so , and then without warning you find the solid floor is a trapdoor and you are now in another place whose geography is uncertain and whose customs are strange ? Travellers at least have a choice . Those who set sail know that things will not be the same as at home . Explorers are prepared . But for us , who travel along the blood vessels , who come to the cities of the interior by chance , there is no preparation . We who were fluent find life is a foreign language . Somewhere between the swamp and the mountains . Somewhere between fear and sex . Somewhere between God and the Devil | passion is and the way there is sudden and the way back is worse . I 'm
25675	25736	25738	25740	the meat man	795	'm young , the world is before me , there will be others . I feel my first streak of defiance since I met her . My first upsurge of self . I wo n't see her again . I can go home , throw aside these clothes and move on . I can move out if I like . I 'm
25983	26208	26209	26209	She	811	'm telling you stories . Trust me . a When we met again I had borrowed an officer 's uniform . Or , more precisely , stolen it . This is what happened . At the Casino , well after midnight , a soldier had approached me and suggested an unusual wager . If I could beat him at billiards he would make me a present of his purse . He held it up before me . It was round and nicely padded and there must be some of my father 's blood in me because I have never been able to resist a purse . And if I lost ? I was to make him a present of my purse . There was no mistaking his meaning . 69 THE PASSION a We played , cheered on by a dozen bored gamblers and , to my surprise , the soldier played well . After a few hours at the Casino nobody plays anything well . I lost . We went to his room and he was a man who liked his women face down , arms outstretched like the crucified Christ . He was able and easy and soon fell asleep . He was also about my height . I left him his shirt and boots and took the rest . your feet . '

26691	27999	26661	26661	She	811	' I did n't go home . I stayed . The churches prepared for Christmas . Every Madonna was gilded and every Jesus re - painted . The priests took out their glorious golds and scarlets and the incense was especially sweet . I took to going to service twice a day to bask in the assurance of Our Lord . I 've never had a conscience about basking . In summer I do it against the walls or I sit like the lizards of the Levant on top of our iron wells . I love the way wood holds heat , and if I can I take my boat and lie directly in the path of the sun for a day . My body loosens then , my mind floats away and I wonder if this is what holy men feel when they talk about their 71 THE PASSION trances ? I 've seen holy men come from the eastern lands . We had an exhibit of them once to make up for the law prohibiting bull - baiting . Their bodies were loose but I have heard it 's to do with the food they eat . Basking ca n't be called holy , but if it achieves the same results will God mind ? I do n't think so . In the Old Testament the end always justified the means . We understand that in Venice , being a pragmatic people . The sun is gone now and I must do my basking in other ways . . Church basking is taking what 's there and not paying for it . Taking the comfort and joy and ignoring the rest . Christmas but not Easter . I never bother with church at Easter . It 's too gloomy , and besides the sun 's out by then . If I went to confession , what would I confess ? That I crossdress ? So did Our Lord , so do the priests . That I steal ? So did Our Lord , so do the priests . That I am in love ? The object of my love has gone away for Christmas . That 's what they do at this time of year . He and she . I thought I 'd mind , but since the first few days , when my stomach and chest were full of stones , I 've been happy . Relieved almost . I 've seen my old friends and walked by myself with almost the same sure - footedness that I used to . The relief comes from no more clandestine meetings . No more snatched hours . There was a particular week when she ate two breakfasts every day . One at home and one with me . One in the drawing - room and one in the Square . After that her lunches were a disaster . She is much prone to going to the theatre , and because he does not enjoy the stage she goes alone . For a time she only saw one act of everything . In the interval she came to me . Venice is full of urchins who will carry notes from one eager palm to another . In the hours we could not meet we sent messages of love and urgency . In the hours we could meet our passion was brief and fierce . 72 THE QUEEN OF SPADES She dresses for me . I have never seen her in the same clothes twice . Now , I am wholly given over to selfishness . I think about myself , I get up when I like , instead of at the crack of dawn just to watch her open the shutters . I flirt with waiters and gamblers and remember that I enjoy that . I sing to myself and I bask in churches . Is this freedom delicious because rare ? Is any respite from love welcome because temporary ? If she were gone for ever these days of mine would not be lit up . Is it because she will return that I take pleasure in being alone ? Hopeless heart that thrives on paradox ; that longs for the beloved and is secretly relieved when the beloved is not there . That gnaws away at the night - time hours desperate for a sign and appears at breakfast so self - composed . That longs for certainty , fidelity , compassion , and plays roulette with anything precious . Gambling is not a vice , it is an expression of our humanness . We gamble . Some do it at the gaming table , some do not . You play , you win , you play , you lose . You play . The Holy child has been born . His mother is elevated . His father forgotten . The angels are singing in the choir stalls and God sits on the roof of each church and pours his blessing on to those below . What a wonder , joining yourself to God , pitting your wits against him , knowing that you win and lose simultaneously . Where else could you indulge without fear the exquisite masochism of the victim ? Lie beneath his lances and close your eyes . Where else could you be so in control ? Not in love , certainly . His need for you is greater than your need for him because he knows the consequences of not possessing you , whereas you , who know nothing , can throw your cap in the air and live another day . You paddle in the water and he never crosses your mind , but he is busy recording the precise force of the flood around your ankles . 73 THE PASSION Bask in it . In spite of what the monks say , you can meet God without getting up early . You can meet God lounging in the pew . The hardship is a man - made device because man can not exist without passion . Religion is somewhere between fear and sex . And God ? Truly ? In his own right , without our voices speaking for him ? Obsessed I think , but not passionate . In our dreams we sometimes struggle from the oceans of destre up Jacob 's ladder to that orderly place . Then human voices wake us and we drown . On New Year 's Eve , a procession of boats alive with candles stretched down the Grand Canal . Rich and poor shared the same water and harboured the same dreams that next year , in its own way , would be better . My mother and father in their bakery best gave away loaves to the sick and the dispossessed . My father was drunk and had to be stopped from singing verses he had learnt in a French bordello . Farther out , hidden away in the inner city , the exiles had their own observation . The dark canals were as dark as ever but a closer look revealed tattered satin on yellow bodies , the glint of a goblet from some subterranean hole . The slant - eyed children had stolen a goat and were solemnly slitting its throat when I rowed past . They stopped their red knives for a moment to watch me . My philosopher friend was on her balcony . That is , a couple of crates fastened to the iron rings on either side of her nook . She was wearing something on her head , a circle , dark and heavy . I slid past her and she asked me what time it might be . Almost New Year . '
28000	28008	28009	28009	She	828	' I know it . It smells . '
28782	28790	28775	28776	any child	870	' Will you kill people , Henri ? '
28791	28801	29150	29150	he	873	‘ Not people , Louise , just the enemy . '

28827	29131	29150	29150	he	873	're the conqueror . Your enemies take up more room than your friends . Could so many straightforward ordinary lives suddenly become men to kill and women to rape ? Austrians , Prussians , Italians , Spaniards , Egyptians , English , Poles , Russians . Those were the people who were either our enemies or our dependants . There were others , but the list is too long . We never did invade England . We marched out of Boulogne leaving our little barges to rot and fought the Third Coalition instead . We fought at Ulm and Austerlitz . Eylau and Friedland . We fought on no rations , our boots fell apart , we slept two or three hours a night and died in thousands every day . Two years later Bonaparte was standing on a barge in the middle of a river hugging the Czar and saying we 'd never have to fight again . It was the English in our way and with Russia on our side the English would have to leave us alone . No more coalitions , no more marches . Hot bread and the fields of France . We believed him . We always did . I lost an eye at Austerlitz . Domino was wounded and Patrick , who is still with us , never sees much past the next bottle . That should have been enough . I should have vanished the way 79 THE PASSION soldiers do . Taken another name , set up shop in some small village , got married perhaps . I did n't expect to come here . The view is good and the seagulls take bread from my window . One of the others here boils seagulls , but only in the winter . In summer they 're

But canvas and potatoes do not challenge the zero winter ; if anything , they denied us the happy oblivion that comes with dying of cold . When soldiers finally lie down , knowing they wo n't get up again , most of them smile . There 's a comfort in falling asleep in the snow . He looked ill . '

32402	32624	32392	32392	I	0	' I was taken aback and for a moment consumed with jealousy . Perhaps Patrick loved her ? Perhaps she loved him ? Love . In the middle of a zero winter . What was I thinking ? We packed the rest of her food and a good deal of Bonaparte 's . He trusted me and I had never given him reason not to . Well , even great men can be surprised . We took what there was and she returned wrapped in a huge fur , another of her souvenirs of Moscow . As we set off , I slipped into Domino 's tent and left him as much of the food as I dared spare and scrawled my name in the ice on the sledge . Then we were gone . We walked for a night and a day without stopping . Our legs assumed an ungainly rhythm and we were afraid to stop in case our lungs or our legs buckled under us . We did n't talk , we wrapped our noses and mouths as tightly as we could and let our eyes poke out like slits . There was no fresh snow . The hard ground rang at our heels . I remembered a woman with her baby , her heels sparking the cobbles . '
32631	32870	32629	32629	soldier	591	' Why do all happy memories feel like yesterday though years have passed ? We were heading in the direction we had come , using the charred villages as gruesome signposts , but our progress was 88 THE ZERO WINTER slow and we were afraid to stick directly to the roads for fear of Russian troops or some of our own army , greedy and desperate . Mutineers , or traitors as they were more usually called , found no leniency and were given no opportunity to make their excuses . We camped where we could find some natural shelter and huddled together for warmth . I wanted to touch her , but her body was covered all over and my hands were gloved . On the seventh night , coming out of the forest , we found a hut full of primitive muskets , a dump for the Russian troops we supposed , but there was no one . We were weary and took our chance in there , using dregs of gunpowder from the barrels to light a fire . It was the first night we had had enough shelter to take off our boots and Patrick and I were soon stretching our toes at the blaze , risking permanent damage to our feet . Our companion loosed her laces but kept her boots on , and seeing my surprise at forgoing this unexpected luxury said , '
32917	32924	32926	32926	Patrick	125	' A fire and a tale , '
32928	32940	32942	32942	he	125	' Now all we need is a drop of something hot , '

36667	36722	36649	36649	They	1200	'm grateful to them for that ; this is no place for a heart . * She was silent . Patrick and I , who had not uttered a word nor moved at all save to shield our scorching feet , felt unable to speak . It was she who broke the silence again . ‘
36735	36864	36649	36649	They	1200	' She seemed carefree and the shadows that had crossed her face throughout her story had lifted , but I felt my own just beginning . She would never love me . I had found her too late . I wanted to ask her more about her watery city that is never the same , to see her eyes light up for love of something if not for love of me , but she was already spreading her furs and settling to sleep . Cautiously , I put my hand to her face and she smiled , reading my thoughts . 99 THE PASSION When we get through this snow , I 'll take you to the city of disguises and you 'll find one that suits you .

38128	39243	38121	38121	I	0	' When I think of that night , here in this place where I will always be , my hands tremble and my muscles ache . I lose all sense of day or night , I lose all sense of my work , writing this story , trying to convey to you what really happened . Trying not to make up too much . I can think of it by mistake , my eyes blurring the words in front of me , my pen lifting and staying lifted , I can think of it for hours and yet it is always the same moment I think of . Her hair as she bent over me , red with streaks of gold , her hair on my face and chest and looking up at her through her hair . She let it fall over me and I felt I was lying in the long grass , safe . a When we left the village we left with a series of short cuts drawn for us on our map and more food than they should have spared . I felt guilty because apart from Villanelle , they should have killed us . Wherever we went we found men and women who hated the French . Men and women whose futures had been decided for them . They were not articulate thinking people , they were people of the land who were content with little and zealous in their worship of custom and God . Although their lives were not much changed , they felt slighted because their leaders had been slighted , they felt out of control and resented the armies and the puppet Kings Bonaparte left behind . Bonaparte always claimed he knew what was good for a people , knew how to improve , how to educate . He did ; he improved wherever he went , but he always forgot that even simple people want the freedom to make their own mistakes . Bonaparte wanted no mistakes . In Poland we pretended we were all Italian and received 103 THE PASSION the sympathy due to one occupied race from another . When Villanelle revealed her Venetian origins , hands flew across mouths and saintly women crossed themselves . Venice , the city of Satan . Was it really like that ? and even the most disapproving crept up to her and asked whether or not there were truly 11,000 prostitutes all richer than Kings ? Villanelle , who loved to tell stories , wove for their wildest dreams . She even said that the boatmen had webbed feet , and while Patrick and I could hardly swallow our laughter , the Poles grew wide - eyed and one even risked excommunication by suggesting that perhaps Christ had been able to walk on the water thanks to the same accident of birth . As we travelled , we heard about the Grande Armée , how many thousands had died and I was sick to hear of so much waste and for no purpose . Bonaparte said that a night in Paris with the whores would replenish every one . Maybe , but it would take seventeen years for them to grow up . Even the French were beginning to get tired . Even the women without ambition wanted something more than to produce boys to be killed and girls to grow up to produce more boys . We were getting weary . Talleyrand wrote to the Czar and said , The French people are civilised , their leader is not ... We are not especially civilised , we wanted what he wanted for a long time . We wanted glory and conquest and slaves and praise . His desire burned for longer than ours because it was never likely that he would pay for it with his life . He kept his valuable , fabulous thing behind the secret panel until the last moment , but we , who had so little except our lives , were gambling with all we had from the start . He saw what we felt . He reflected on our losses . He had tents and food when we were dying . He was trying to found a dynasty . We were fighting for our lives . 104 THE ZERO WINTER There 's no such thing as a limited victory . One conquest only leads on , ineluctably , to another , to protect what has been won . We found no friends of France on our journey , only crushed enemies . Enemies like you and me with the same hopes and fears , neither good nor bad . I had been taught to look for monsters and devils and I found ordinary people . But the ordinary people were looking for devils too . The Austrians in particular believed the French to be brutal and beneath contempt . Still believing us to be Italian , they were generous to a fault and compared us favourably in every way with the French . And if I had thrown off my disguise ? What then , would I have turned into a devil before their eyes ? I worried that they would smell me , that their noses , so disdainful and attuned to hate anything that had a whiff of Bonaparte , would detect me straight away . But it seems we are as we appear . What a nonsense we make of our hatreds when we can only recognise them in the most obvious circumstances . a We were close to the Danube when Patrick began to behave oddly . We had been travelling for more than two months and we found ourselves in a valley surrounded by pine forests . We were at the bottom like ants in a great green cage . We were making good time now that we were out of the snow and the worst of the cold . Our spirits were high ; another two weeks perhaps and we might reach Italy . Patrick had been singing songs since we left Moscow . Unintelligible , tuneless songs but sounds we had grown accustomed to , that we marched to . For the last day or so he had been silent , hardly eating and not wanting to talk . As we sat around our fire in the valley that night , he started to talk about Ireland and how much he wanted to be home . He was wondering whether or not he could persuade the Bishop to give him a parish again . He had liked being a priest , ‘
39259	40012	39256	39256	I	0	' 105 THE PASSION He said it made sense , whether you believed or not , it made sense to go to church and think about someone who was n't your family or your enemy . I said it was hypocritical and he said Domino was right about me ; that I was a puritan at heart , did n't understand weakness and mess and simple humanness . I was very much hurt by this , but I think what he said was true and it is a fault in me . Villanelle told us about the churches in Venice with their paintings of angels and devils and thieving men and adulterous women and animals everywhere . Patrick brightened and thought he might try his luck in Venice first . He woke me in the middle of the night . He was raving . I tried to hold him down , but he 's strong and neither I nor Villanelle dared risk his flailing fists and feet . He was sweating despite the cold night and there was blood on his lips . We piled our blankets over him and I set off into the dark that still terrified me to find more dry wood and build up the fire . We built him a fiery furnace but he could n't get warm . He sweated and shook and shouted that he was freezing to death , that the Devil had got into his lungs and was breathing damnation at him . He died at about dawn . We had no shovels , no way of penetrating the black earth , so we carried him between us to the beginning of the pine forests and covered him with bracken and branches and leaves . Buried him like a hedgehog waiting for summer . Then we were afraid . What had he died of and could we have caught it ? Despite the weather and our need to move on , we went to the river and washed ourselves and our clothes and shivered in the weak afternoon sun by the fire . Villanelle was talking gloomily about catarrh , but I knew nothing then of that Venetian disease that now attacks me every November . When we left Patrick behind we left our optimism with him . We had begun to believe that we would finish our journey 106 THE ZERO WINTER and now that seemed less possible . If one can go why not three ? We tried to joke , remembering his face when the ox - boy had sat on him , remembering his wild sightings ; he once claimed to have spotted the Blessed Virgin herself touring the heavens on a gilded donkey . He was always seeing things and it did n't matter how or what , it mattered that he saw and that he told us stories . Stories were all we had . He had told us the story of his miraculous eye and when he had first discovered it . It was on a hot morning in County Cork and the church doors were wide open to let out the heat and the smell of sweat that even a good wash ca n't get rid of after six days in the fields . Patrick was preaching a fine sermon about Hell and the perils of the flesh and his eyes roamed the congregation ; at least his right eye did , he found that his left eye was focused three fields away on a pair of his parishioners who were committing adultery under God 's Heaven while their spouses knelt in his church . After the sermon , Patrick was deeply perplexed . Had he seen them or was he like St Jerome and subject to lustful visions ? He walked round to visit them that afternoon and , after a few chance remarks , judged from their guilty faces that they had indeed been doing what he thought they 'd been doing . There was a woman of the parish , very devout with a bosom а that preceded her , and Patrick found by standing in his little manse he could see straight into her bedroom without any vulgar telescope . He did look occasionally , just to check that she was n't in sin . He reckoned , after all , that the Lord must have granted him this eye for some righteous purpose . Had n't he granted Samson strength ? '
40023	40496	40014	40014	Samson	183	' Could he see us now ? Could he look down from his place next to the Blessed Virgin and see us walking away thinking of him ? 107 THE PASSION Perhaps both his eyes were now far - sighted . I wanted him to be in Heaven even though I did n't believe there could be such a place . I wanted him to see us home . Many of my friends were dead . There was only one boy left of those five of us who had laughed at the red barn and the cows we had birthed . Others I had come to know over the years and grown used to had been fatally wounded or recorded missing on one battlefield or another . A fighting man is careful not to make too many ties . I saw a cannonball blow a stonemason in two , a man I liked and I tried to drag his two halves off the field , but when I came back for his legs they were indistinguishable from the other legs . There was a carpenter they had shot for carving a rabbit out of his musket - butt . Death in battle seemed glorious when we were not in battle . But for the men who were bloodied and maimed and made to run through smoke that choked them into enemy lines where bayonets were waiting , death in battle seemed only what it was . Death . The curious thing is that we always went back . The Grande Armée had more recruits than it could train and very few desertions , at least until recently . Bonaparte said war was in our blood . Could that be true ? And if it is true there will be no end to these wars . Not now , not ever . Whenever we shout Peace ! and run home to our sweethearts and till the land we will be not in peace but in a respite from the war to come . War will always be in the future . The future crossed out . It ca n't be in our blood . Why would a people who love the grape and the sun die in the zero winter for one man ? Why did I ? Because I loved him . He was my passion and when we go to war we feel we are not a lukewarm people any more . 108 THE ZERO WINTER What did Villanelle think ? Men are violent . That 's all there is to it . Being with her was like pressing your eye to a particularly vivid kaleidoscope . She was all primary colour and although she understood better than I the ambiguities of the heart she was not equivocal in her thinking . '
40505	40509	40014	40014	Samson	183	' she said , '
40524	40586	40517	40517	I	0	' We were now in the Kingdom of Italy , and it was her plan to take a boat to Venice , where we could stay with her family until it was safe for me to return to France . In return , she would ask of me a favour and that favour concerned the re - possession of her heart . ‘
40608	40681	40600	40600	you	1261	' I promised her my help but there was something I wanted too ; why had she never taken her boots off ? Not even while we stayed with the peasants in Russia ? Not even in bed ? She laughed and drew back her hair , and her eyes were bright with two deep furrows between the eyebrows . I thought she was the most beautiful woman I had ever seen . '
40700	40988	40692	40692	Boatmen	630	' and that was all she would say , but I determined on my arrival in her enchanted city to find out more about these boatmen and their boots . We were fortunate in a fair passage and on that calm glittering sea the war and the winter seemed years away . Someone else 's past . And so it was that in May 1813 I had my first glimpse of Venice . Arriving at Venice by sea , as one must , is like seeing an invented city rise up and quiver in the air . It is a trick of the early light to make the buildings shimmer so that they seem 109 THE PASSION never still . It is not built on any lines I can fathom but rather seems to have pushed itself out , impudently , here and there . To have swelled like yeast in a shape of its own . There are no preliminaries , no docks for the smaller craft , your boat anchors in the lagoon and in a moment with no more ado you are in St Mark 's Square . I watched Villanelle 's face ; the face of someone coming home , seeing nothing but the homecoming . Her eyes flickered from the domes to cats , embracing what she saw and passing a silent message that she was back . I envied her that . I was still an exile . We landed and taking my hand she led me through an impossible maze , past something I seemed to translate as the Bridge of Fists and even more unlikely , the Canal of the Toilet , until we arrived at a quiet waterway . ‘
40997	41010	41011	41011	Their	1267	' she said , “ the front door is on the canal . '
41093	41096	41084	41085	her father	1923	‘ Ha Ha '

41162	41202	41152	41154	Villanelle 's husband	1280	' I looked at her startled . She had never said that her fat husband was a Frenchman . I presumed her facility for my language had come with living around so many soldiers for most of her life . '
41231	41245	41216	41216	she	157	' He comes and goes , like always , but you can hide . '
41267	41276	41278	41279	her mother	1900	' When I was married to a boatman , '
41281	41304	41305	41305	she	1900	' things were happening every day , but the boat people are clannish and now that I am married to a baker , '
41310	41320	41305	41305	she	1900	' they go their ways and I go mine . '
41357	41375	41346	41346	Henri	114	' and she slapped me on the knee so violently that I fell back in my chair . '
41381	41386	41346	41346	Henri	114	' said her husband , '

41407	41467	41405	41405	I	0	' and she forced me to eat another cake . When I was reeling with cakes and wine and almost collapsed with exhaustion , she took me around the house and showed me in particular the little grille with a mirror positioned at such an angle as to reveal the identity of any caller at the water - gate . '
41514	42079	42080	42080	We	1289	' I thanked her and slept for two days . On the third day I awoke to a quiet house and my room completely dark because the shutters were so tightly closed . I threw them back and let in the yellow light that touched my face and broke in spears across the floor . I could see the dust in the sunlight . The room was low and uneven and the walls had faded spaces where pictures had hung . There was a wash - stand and a full jug , ice cold , and after so much cold and in this warmth , I III THE PASSION could only bear to dip in my fingers and rub away the sleep from my eyes . There was a mirror too . Full length on a wooden swivel stand . The mirror was silvered in places , but I saw myself , thin and bony , with a too large head and a ruffian 's beard . They were right . I must shave before I went out . From my window which overlooked the canal I saw a whole world going about in boats . Vegetable boats , passenger boats , boats with canopies covering rich ladies and bones as thin as a knife - blade with raised prows . These were the strangest boats of all because their owners rowed them standing up . As far as I could see , the canal was marked at regular intervals with gaily striped poles , some with boats butting against them , others , their gold tops peeling in the sun . I threw the filthy water I used along with the remains of my beard into the canal and prayed that my past had sunk for ever . I got lost from the first . Where Bonaparte goes , straight roads follow , buildings are rationalised , street signs may change to celebrate a battle but they are always clearly marked . Here , if they bother with street signs at all , they are happy to use the same ones over again . Not even Bonaparte could rationalise Venice . → This is a city of madmen . Everywhere , I found a church and sometimes it seemed I found the same square but with different churches . Perhaps here churches spring up overnight like mushrooms and dissolve as quickly with the dawn . Perhaps the Venetians build them overnight ? At the height of their powers they built a galleon every day , fully fitted . Why not a church , fully fitted ? The only rational place in the whole city is the public garden and even there , on a foggy night , four sepulchral churches rise up and swamp the regimental pines . I did not return to the baker 's home for five days because I could not find my way and because I felt embarrassed to speak French to these people . I walked , looking for bread stalls , sniffing II2 THE ZERO WINTER a a like a tracker dog , hoping to catch a clue on the air . But I only found churches . At last , I turned a corner , a corner I swear I had turned a hundred times before and I saw Villanelle plaiting her hair in a boat . '

Even when you have mastered the squares and you can pass from the Rialto to the Ghetto and out to the lagoon with confidence , there will still be places you can never find and if you do find them you may never see St Mark 's again . Leave plenty of time in your doings and be prepared to go another way , to do something not planned if that is where the streets lead you . We rowed in a shape that seemed to be a figure of eight working back on itself . When I suggested to Villanelle that she was being deliberately mysterious and taking me a way I would never recognise again , she smiled and said she was taking me down an ancient way that only a boatman could hope to remember . 113 THE PASSION a “ The cities of the interior do not lie on any map .

His hand scraped her breast . His mouth . His mouth is the clearest image I have . A pale pink mouth , a cavern of flesh and then his tongue , just visible like a worm from its hole . She pushed him and he lost balance between the two boats and fell on to me , nearly crushing me . He put his hands to my throat and I heard Villanelle cry out and throw her knife towards me , within reach . A Venetian knife , thin and cruel . '

Villanelle dragged him off me , half off me , and I stood up , not unsteady at all . I told her to help me turn him over and she did so , watching me . When we had him belly up and running blood I tore his shirt from the collar down and looked at his chest . Hairless and white , like the flesh of saints . Can saints and devils be so alike ?

48669	49646	49647	49648	a Venetian	655	' I sat with my head on my knees , my eyes fixed on the floor of the boat that swam with blood . My feet rested in blood . The cook , face up , had his eyes fixed on God . Our boats were moving . I saw his boat in front of me gliding ahead , mine tied to it the way children tie their boats on a pond . We were moving . How ? I raised my head fully , my knees still drawn up , and saw Villanelle , her back towards me , a rope over her shoulder , walking on the canal and dragging our boats . Her boots lay neatly one by the other . Her hair was down . I was in the red forest and she was leading me home . 129 1 ! | 4 . 4 . the Rock | They say the dead do n't talk . Silent as the grave they say . It 's not true . The dead are talking all the time . On this rock , when the wind is up , I can hear them . I can hear Bonaparte ; he did n't last long on his rock . He put on weight and caught a cold , and he who survived the plagues of Egypt and the zero winter died in the mild damp . The Russians invaded Paris and we did n't burn it down , we gave it up and they took him away and restored the monarchy . His heart sang . On a windy island in the face of gulls , his heart sang . He waited for the moment and like the third son who knows his treacherous brothers wo n't outwit him , the moment came and in a salty convoy of silent boats he returned for a hundred days and met his Waterloo . What could they do with him ? These victorious Generals and self - righteous nations ? You play , you win , you play , you lose . You play . The end of every game is an anti - climax . What you thought you would feel you do n't feel , what you thought was so important is n't any more . It 's the game that 's exciting . And if you win ? There 's no such thing as a limited victory . You must protect what you have won . You must take it seriously . Victors lose when they are tired of winning . Perhaps they regret it later , but the impulse to gamble the valuable , fabulous thing is too strong . The impulse to be reckless again , to go barefoot , like you used to , before you inherited all those shoes . . He never slept , he had an ulcer , he had divorced Joséphine and married a selfish bitch ( though he deserved her ) , he needed a dynasty to protect his Empire . He had no friends . It took him about three minutes to have sex and increasingly he did n't even 133 THE PASSION a bother to unbuckle his sword . Europe hated him . The French were tired of going to war and going to war and going to war . He was the most powerful man in the world . Returning from that island the first time he felt like a boy again . A hero again with nothing to lose . A saviour with one change of clothes . When they won hands down a second time and chose for him a darker rock where the tides were harsh and the company unsympathetic , they were burying him alive . ? The Third Coalition . The forces of moderation against this madman . I hated him , but they were no better . The dead are dead , whatever side they fight on . Three madmen versus one madman . Numbers win . Not righteousness . When the wind is up , I hear him weeping and he comes to me , his hands still greasy from his last dinner , and he asks me if I love him . His face pleads with me to say I do and I think of those who went into exile with him and one by one took a small boat home . They had notebooks with them mostly . His life - story , his feelings on the rock . They were going to make their fortunes exhibiting this lamed beast . Even his servants learned to write . He talks about his past obsessively because the dead have no future and their present is recollection . They are in eternity because time has stopped . Joséphine is still alive and has recently introduced the geranium to France . I mentioned this to him , but he said he never liked flowers . My room here is very small . If I lie down , which I try not to do for reasons I will explain , I can touch each corner just by stretching out . I have a window though and , unlike most of the other windows here , it has no bars . It is perfectly open . It has a 134 THE ROCK no glass . I can lean right out and look across the lagoon and sometimes I see Villanelle in her boat . She waves to me with her handkerchief . In winter , I have a thick curtain made of sacks that I drape twice over the window and fasten to the floor with my commode . It works well enough providing I keep my blanket round me , though I suffer from catarrh . That proves I 'm

We set out early each morning and rioted in the churches . That is to say , Villanelle basked in the colour and drama of God without giving God a thought and I sat on the steps playing noughts and crosses . We ran our hands over every warm surface and soaked up the sun from iron and wood and the baking fur of millions of cats . We ate fish fresh caught . She rowed me round the island in a pageant boat borrowed from a Bishop . 136 THE ROCK > On the second night incessant summer rain flooded St Mark 's Square and we stood on the edge watching a pair of Venetians weave their way across by means of two chairs . ‘

I hearda story about the cold wastelands in the far north where the nights are six months long and I hoped for an ordinary miracle to take us there . Would time pass if I refused to let it ? '
52242	52246	52247	52247	We	1576	' You can . '
52250	52348	52247	52247	We	1576	' She hugged me and promised to be at the lagoon before the grim boat sailed away . I had few possessions but I wanted Domino 's talisman and a picture of the Madonna her mother had embroidered for me . San Servelo . It used to be just for the rich and mad but Bonaparte , who was egalitarian about lunacy at least , opened it to the public and set aside funds for its upkeep . It was still faded splendour inside . The rich and mad like their comforts . There was a spacious visitors '

When Henri was taken to San Servelo in the grim boat I set about procuring his release straight away . I tried to find out on I what grounds the insane are kept there and if they are ever examined by a doctor to see if there has been any improvement . It seems that they are , but only those who are no danger to mankind can be let free . Absurd , when there are so many dangers to mankind walking free without examination . Henri was an inmate for life . There were no legal means of having him freed , at least not while Piero had anything to do with it . 142 THE ROCK Well then , I would have to help him escape and ensure his passage to France . For the first few months that I visited him he seemed cheerful and sanguine , despite sleeping in a room with three other men of hideous appearance and terrifying habits . He said he did n't notice them . He said he had his notebooks and he was busy . Perhaps there were signs of his change much earlier than I recognised , but my life had taken an unexpected turn and I was preoccupied . I do n't know what madness drove me to take a house opposite hers . A house with six storeys like hers , with long windows that let in the light and caught the sun in pools . I paced the floors of my house , never bothering to furnish any of them , looking in her sitting - room , her drawing - room , her sewing - room and seeing not her but a tapestry of myself when I was younger and walked like an arrogant boy . I was beating a rug on my balcony when I finally saw her . She saw me too and we stood like statues , each on our balconies . I dropped the rug into the canal . '

He would n't let me comfort him and we never made love again . Not my doing . 148 THE ROCK a The day came for his escape . I went to fetch him , running up the stairs two at a time , opening his door with my own key as I always did . '

55478	56129	55452	55452	he	1691	' The warder shrugged , a Venetian way of saying everything and nothing . I went back dozens of times , always finding that he did n't 149 THE PASSION want to see me , always taking tea with the polite warder who wanted to be my lover and is n't . A long time later , when I was rowing the lagoon and drifting out to his lonely rock , I saw him leaning from the window and I waved and he waved back and I thought then he might see me . He would not . Not me nor the baby , who is a girl with a mass of hair like the early sun and feet like his . I row out every day now and he waves , but from my letters that are returned I know I have lost him . Perhaps he has lost himself . For myself , I still bask in church in the winter and on the warm walls in summer and my daughter is clever and already loves to see the dice fall and to spread the cards . I can not save her from the Queen of spades nor any other , she will draw her lot when the time comes and gamble her heart away . How else could it be with such consuming hair ? I am living alone . I prefer it that way , though I am not alone every night and increasingly I go to the Casino , to see old friends and to look at the case on the wall with two white hands . The valuable , fabulous thing . I do n't dress up any more . No borrowed uniforms . Only occasionally do I feel the touch of that other life , the one in the shadows where I do not choose to live . This is the city of disguises . What you are one day will not constrain you on the next . You may explore yourself freely and , if you have wit or wealth , no one will stand in your way . This city was built on wit and wealth and we have a fondness for both , though they do not have to appear in tandem . I take my boat out on the lagoon and listen to the seagulls cry and wonder where I will be in eight years , say . In the soft darkness that hides the future from the over - curious , I content myself with this ; that where I will be will not be where I am . The cities of the interior are vast , do not lie on any map . 150 THE ROCK And the valuable , fabulous thing ? Now that I have it back ? Now that I have been given a reprieve such as only the stories offer ? Will I gamble it again ? Yes . Après moi , le deluge . Not really . A few drowned but a few have drowned before . a He over - estimated himself . Odd that a man should come to believe in myths of his own making . On this rock , the events in France hardly touched me . What difference could it make to me , safe at home with mother and my friends ! I was glad when they sent him to Elba . A quick death would have made him a hero straight away . Much better for reports to seep through of his increasing weight and bad temper . They were clever , those Russians and English , they did not bother to hurt him , they simply diminished him . Now that he 's dead , he 's becoming a hero again and nobody minds because he ca n't make the most of it . I 'm
56163	56630	56633	56633	her	1695	'm pleased to see him is when the cook 's here , the cook 's terrified of him and leaves at once . They all leave their smells behind ; Bonaparte 's is chicken . I keep getting letters from Villanelle . I send them back to her unopened and I never reply . Not because I do n't think about her , not because I do n't look for her from my window every day . I have to send her away because she hurts me too much . There was a time , some years ago I think , when she tried to make me leave this place , though not to be with her . She was 151 THE PASSION asking me to be alone again , just when I felt safe . I do n't ever want to be alone again and I do n't want to see any more of the world . The cities of the interior are vast and do not lie on any map . The day she came was the day Domino died and I have not seen him . He does n't come here . I woke that morning and counted my possessions as I do ; the Madonna , my notebooks , this story , my lamp and wicks , my pens and my talisman . My talisman had melted . Only the gold chain remained , lying thin in a pool of water , glittering . I picked it up and wrapped it around my fingers , strung it from one finger to another and watched how it slid like a snake . I knew then he was dead , though I do not know how or where . I put the chain around my neck , sure that she would notice it when she came but she did n't . Her eyes were bright and her hands were full of running away . I had run away with her before , come as an exile to her home and stayed for love . Fools stay for love . I am a fool . I stayed in the army eight years because I loved someone . You 'd think that would have been enough . I stayed too because I had nowhere else to go . I stay here by choice . That means a lot to me . She seemed to think we could reach her boat without being caught . Was she mad ? I 'd have to kill again . I could n't do that , not even for her . She told me she was going to have a baby but she did n't want to marry me . How can that be ? I want to marry her and I 'm
56758	56762	56766	56766	they	1704	're mad and I 'm
56796	56902	56905	56905	Villanelle	157	'm much interested in . What am I interested in ? Passion . Obsession . I have known both and I know the dividing line is as thin and cruel as a Venetian knife . When we walked from Moscow through the zero winter I believed I was walking to a better place . I believed I was taking action and leaving behind the sad and sordid things that had so long oppressed me . Free will , my friend the priest said , belongs to us all . The will to change . I do n't take much account of scrying or sortilege . I 'm
56954	56965	56935	56963	a gipsy who caught me in Austria and made the sign of the cross at my forehead saying , ' Sorrow in what you do and a lonely place	3331	' Sorrow in what you do and a lonely place . '
57153	57962	57970	57970	she	1718	're sure of that , and every person has his own idea of where . My friend the priest , for all his worldliness , found his freedom in God , and Patrick found it in a jumbled mind where goblins kept him company . Domino said it was in the present , in the moment only that you could be free , rarely and unexpectedly . Bonaparte taught us that freedom lay in our fighting arm , but in the legends of the Holy Grail no one won it by force . It was Perceval , the gentle knight , who came to a ruined chapel and found what the others had overlooked , simply by sitting still . I think now that being free is not being powerful or rich or well regarded or without obligations but being able to love . To love someone else enough to forget about yourself even for one moment is to be free . The mystics and the churchmen talk about throwing off this body and its desires , being no longer a slave to the flesh . They do n't say that through the flesh we are set free . That our desire for another will lift us out of ourselves more cleanly than anything divine . We are a lukewarm people and our longing for freedom is our longing for love . If we had the courage to love we would not so value these acts of war . At my window the seagulls cry . I should feed them , I save my breakfast bread so that I have something to give them . Love , they say , enslaves and passion is a demon and many have been lost for love . I know this is true , but I know too that without love we grope the tunnels of our lives and never see the sun . When I fell in love it was as though I looked into a mirror for the first time and saw myself . I lifted my hand in wonderment and felt my cheeks , my neck . This was me . And when I had looked at myself and grown accustomed to who I was , I was not a 154 THE ROCK afraid to hate parts of me because I wanted to be worthy of the mirror bearer . Then , when I had regarded myself for the first time , I regarded the world and saw it to be more various and beautiful than I thought . Like most people I enjoyed the hot evenings and the smell of food and the birds that spike the sky , but I was not a mystic nor a man of God and I did not feel the extasy I had read about . I longed for feeling though I could not have told you that . Words like passion and extasy , we learn them but they stay flat on the page . Sometimes we try and turn them over , find out what 's on the other side , and everyone has a story to tell of a woman or a brothel or an opium night or a war . We fear it . We fear passion and laugh at too much love and those who love too much . And still we long to feel . I have started work on the garden here . No one has touched it for years , though I am told it once had fine roses of such a scent that you could smell them from St Mark 's when the wind was right . Now it 's a barbed tangle of thorns . Now the birds do not nest here . It 's an inhospitable place and the salt makes it difficult to choose what to grow . I dream of dandelions . I dream of a wide field where flowers grow of their own accord . Today I shovelled away the soil from around the rockery , then shovelled it back , levelling the ground . Why have a rockery on a rock ? We see enough rock . I will write to Villanelle and ask for some seeds . Strange to think that if Bonaparte had n't divorced Joséphine , the geranium might never have come to France . She would have been too busy with him to develop her undoubted talent for botany . They say she has already brought us over a hundred different kinds of plants and that if you ask her she will send you seeds for nothing . I will write to Joséphine and ask for some seeds . a 155 THE PASSION My mother dried poppies in our roof and at Christmas made scenes from the Bible with the flower heads . I 'm
58118	58209	58211	58211	Adam	153	'm taking her place and the bird sits on my neck , behind my ear , keeping warm . I feed it milk and worms I dia up on my hands and knees , and yesterday it flew for the first time . Flew from the ground where I was planting and up to a thorn . It sang and I held out my finger to bring it home . At night it sleeps in my room in a collar box . I wo n't give it a name . I 'm
58265	58270	58253	58253	She	157	' Look at that , '
58604	58618	58590	58590	He	1731	' You 'll never get out , Henri , not if they think you 're

59332	59611	59329	59329	I	0	'm in love with her , what does that mean ? It means I review my future and my past in the light of this feeling . It is as though I wrote in a foreign language that I am suddenly able to read . Wordlessly she explains me to myself ; like genius she is ignorant of what she does . I go on writing so that I will always have something to read . a There is a frost tonight that will brighten the ground and harden the stars . In the morning when I go into the garden I 'll find it I webbed with nets of ice and cracked ice where I over - watered today . Only the garden freezes like that , the rest is too salty . I can see the lights on the boats and Patrick , who is with me , can see into St Mark 's itself . His eye is still marvellous , especially so since walls no longer get in the way . He describes to me the altar boys in red and the Bishop in his crimson and gold and on the roof the perpetual battle between good and evil . The painted roof that I love . 159 THE PASSION It 's more than twenty years since we went to church at Boulogne . Out now , into the lagoon , the boats with their gilded prows and triumphant lights . A bright ribbon , a talisman for the New Year . I will have red roses next year . A forest of red roses . On this rock ? In this climate ? I 'm
