516	526	528	528	Handley	149	“ Do n't you take any water with them ? ”
538	555	556	556	Handley	149	“ Why bother ? Either you can take 'em or you ca n't . Want one ? ”
561	571	558	558	his	149	“ Not now . I 'm on something else . ”
572	577	532	532	he	149	“ Uppers or downers ? ”
578	585	558	558	his	149	“ Right now , a bummer . ”
586	589	590	590	Auberson	145	" Oh ? ”
606	611	590	590	Auberson	145	“ What 's up ? "
612	618	619	619	Handley	149	" That damned computer again . ”
632	637	621	621	himself	149	“ You mean HARLIE ? ”
638	651	590	590	Auberson	145	“ Who else ? You know another computer with delusions of grandeur ? ”
652	660	590	590	Auberson	145	“ What 's he up to now ? ”
661	670	671	671	Auberson	145	" Same thing . But worse than ever . ”
674	690	671	671	Auberson	145	“ I figured it would happen again . You want me to take a look ? "
691	706	590	590	Auberson	145	“ That 's what you 're getting paid for . You 're the psychologist . ”
707	715	716	716	Auberson	145	“ I 'm also the project chief . ”
719	723	724	724	He	145	“ All right . ”
742	759	733	733	his	145	“ HARLIE , I think , is getting to be more trouble than he 's worth . ”
779	810	772	772	Handley	149	“ You 're just annoyed WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE because every time you think you 've figured out what makes him tick , he makes a liar out of you . ”
814	846	811	811	Auberson	145	“ Robot psychology is still an infant science . How does anyone know what a computer is thinking - especially one that 's convinced it can think like a human being ? ”
853	875	811	811	Auberson	145	“ What 're you doing about dinner ? I have a feeling this is going to be another all - nighter . "
876	887	772	772	Handley	149	" Nothing yet . Want to sent out for something ? "
888	901	902	902	Auberson	145	“ Yeah , that 's probably what we 'll end up doing . ”
912	916	902	902	Auberson	145	“ Want one ? ”
917	925	772	772	Handley	149	“ What are they , Acapulco Golds ? ”
926	929	772	772	Handley	149	" Highmasters . ”
930	934	935	935	Handley	149	“ Good enough . ”
950	966	935	935	Handley	149	“ Frankly , I never thought that Highmasters were as strong as they could be . "
967	975	976	976	Auberson	145	" It 's all in your head . ”
980	988	990	990	Handley	149	" It 's a matter of taste , "
992	1005	990	990	Handley	149	" If you do n't like it , do n't smoke it . ”
1009	1014	1006	1006	Handley	149	“ It was free . ”
1259	1267	1268	1268	he	145	“ This kind of stuff all aftemoon ? ”
1274	1296	1271	1271	Handley	149	“ Uh huh . Only that 's kind of mild compared to some of it . He must be coming down . ”
1297	1303	1321	1321	HARLIE	145	“ Another trip , eh ? ”
1304	1315	1271	1271	Handley	149	" Do n't know what else you could call it . ”
1351	1359	1360	1360	Auberson	145	" Well , so much for that , ”
1363	1377	1360	1360	Auberson	145	" You did n't really expect it to work again , did you ? "
1378	1388	1389	1389	Auberson	145	“ No , but it was worth a try . ”
1400	1411	1389	1389	Auberson	145	“ What kind of inputs have you been giving him ? "
1412	1446	1360	1360	Auberson	145	“ The standard stuff mostly - today 's papers , a couple magazines -nothing out of the ordinary . A couple history texts , some live TV - oh , and Time magazine . ”
1447	1466	1360	1360	Auberson	145	“ Nothing there to send him off like this . Unless — what subject were you stressing today ? "
1467	1471	1389	1389	Auberson	145	“ Art appreciation . "
1472	1476	1478	1478	Auberson	145	" It figures , ”
1480	1580	1478	1478	Auberson	145	“ Whenever we start getting to the really human inputs , he flips out again . Okay , let 's try to bring him down . Give him some statistics — Wall Street , Dow Jones , Standard and Poor — anything else you can think of , anything you 've got that uses a lot of equations . He ca n't resist an equals sign . WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE 5 Try some of that social engineering stuff - but numbers only , no words . Cut off his video too . Give him nothing to think about . ”
1581	1584	1585	1585	Handley	149	“ Right . ”
1971	1988	1963	1963	Auberson	145	“ Handley , get me a complete log tape of HARLIE 's trip , will you ? ”
1989	1992	1994	1995	the engineer	289	“ Right , ”
2172	2190	2157	2157	Auberson	145	“ Hey , Aubie , what are you doing ? He 's starting to flip out again . ”
2191	2197	2157	2157	Auberson	145	“ How can you tell ? ”
2198	2204	2157	2157	Auberson	145	“ By his input meters . ”
2205	2208	2157	2157	Auberson	145	" Input ? ”
2209	2212	2157	2157	Auberson	145	“ Yes . ”
2236	2239	2240	2240	Auberson	145	“ Hmm . ”
2249	2256	2240	2240	Auberson	145	“ He should be okay now . ”
2257	2266	2240	2240	Auberson	145	" He is — it was only momentary . ”
2267	2272	2240	2240	Auberson	145	" Inputs , huh ? ”
2273	2276	2277	2277	HARLIE	145	“ Yep . ”
2473	2481	2465	2465	Auberson	145	“ HARLIE says it could be GIGO . ”
2503	2549	2488	2488	He	151	“ I hope not . I 'd hate to think we 'd slipped all the way back to phase four . I like to think WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE we licked that problem a year ago when we redesigned the judgment and emotional analogue circuits . ”
2550	2554	2609	2609	Auberson	145	“ So do I. ”
2555	2570	2572	2572	Handley	151	“ I 'll never forget the day he finally did an analysis of Jabberwocky , ”
2574	2608	2572	2572	Handley	151	“ It was n't a very perceptive analysis -it was only word - origins and usages , stuff like that , but at least he understood what he was supposed to be doing . ”
2627	2638	2609	2609	Auberson	145	“ We 're a long way from Jabberwocky , Don . "
2639	2645	2609	2609	Auberson	145	" Yeah , I know . "
2646	2662	2609	2609	Auberson	145	“ After all , compared to some of the stuff we 're up to now — "
2663	2669	2609	2609	Auberson	145	“ What ? Time magazine ? ”
2670	2731	2609	2609	Auberson	145	“ Salvador Dali , Ed Keinholz , Heinz Edelmann , to name a few . Also Lennon and McCartney , Dylan , Ionesco , McLuhan , Kubrick , and so on . Do n't forget , we 're dealing with the art of the experience now . This is n't the same as – oh , say the Renaissance masters . "
2732	2750	2609	2609	Auberson	145	“ I know . I 've got one of his imitation da Vincis in my living room . ”
2751	2757	2759	2759	Auberson	145	“ I 've seen it , ”
2761	2764	2759	2759	Auberson	145	“ Remember ? "
2765	2779	2609	2609	Auberson	145	" Oh , yeah - that night we spiked the punch with acid . ”
2780	2794	2609	2609	Auberson	145	“ Yeah . Well , look , that da Vinci stuff is easy . "
2795	2798	2759	2759	Auberson	145	" Huh ? "
2799	2859	2860	2860	Handley	149	" Sure — the Renaissance masters were mainly concerned with such things as perspective and structure , color , shading , modeling -things like that . Da Vinci was more interested in how the body was put together than in what it felt like . He was trying to anticipate the camera . So were the rest of them . ”
2875	2886	2872	2872	Auberson	145	“ So what happens when the camera is finally invented ? ”
2896	2904	2889	2889	his	149	“ The artists are out of jobs ? ”
2905	2945	2872	2872	Auberson	145	“ Wrong . The artists simply have to learn how to do things that the camera ca n't . The artist had to stop being a recorder and start being an interpreter . That 's when expressionism was bom . ”
2946	2952	2953	2953	Handley	149	" You 're oversimplifying it , ”
2959	3012	2956	2956	Auberson	145	“ True - but the point is , that 's when WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE artists began to wonder what things felt like . They had to . And when we reached that point in art history , that 's when we started to lose HARLIE . He could n't follow it . ”
3045	3119	3036	3036	Auberson	145	“ Look , all this stuff we 've been having trouble with it all has one thing in common : It 's experience art . It 's where the experience involving the viewer is the object of the artist 's intention — not the artwork itself . They 're trying to evoke an emotional response in the viewer . And HARLIE ca n't handle it - because he does n't have any emotions . ”
3120	3152	3036	3036	Auberson	145	“ But that 's just it , Aubie - he does . He should be able to handle this stuff . That 's what the analogue circuits are supposed to do _ "
3153	3168	3036	3036	Auberson	145	“ Then why does he keep tripping out ? He says it 's GIGO . ”
3169	3180	3036	3036	Auberson	145	“ Maybe that 's the way he reacts to it , ”
3181	3197	3036	3036	Auberson	145	" Are you telling me the past hundred years of art and literature is garbage ? "
3198	3221	3036	3036	Auberson	145	" Uh uh , not me . That stuff has communicated too much to too many people for it to be meaningless . "
3222	3231	3232	3232	Auberson	145	" I 'm not an art critic either , ”
3235	3240	3241	3241	Handley	149	“ But HARLIE is . ”
3244	3262	3241	3241	Handley	149	" He 's supposed to be . He 's supposed to be an intelligent and objective observer . ”
3263	3296	3036	3036	Auberson	145	" That 's what I 'm getting at - the stuff must be getting to him somehow . It 's the only possible explanation . We 're the ones who are misinterpreting . ”
3297	3307	3036	3036	Auberson	145	“ Um , he said it was GIGO himself . ”
3308	3312	3313	3313	Handley	149	“ Did he ? "
3316	3321	3313	3313	Handley	149	“ Did he really ? ”
3340	3390	3391	3391	He	145	“ Uh , I do n't know . Remind me to look it up later - I suppose you 're right , though . If all that art can communicate to people and HARLIE 's supposed to be a Human Analogue , he should be getting some of it . ”
3395	3411	3391	3391	He	145	“ But he denies any knowledge or understanding of his periods of non - rationality . ”
3412	3417	3419	3419	Handley	149	" He 's lying , ”
3421	3424	3419	3419	Handley	149	“ Huh ? ”
3425	3439	3391	3391	He	145	“ I said , he 's lying . He 's got to be . ”
3445	3448	3449	3449	Auberson	145	" No . "
3466	3482	3458	3458	he	145	“ I ca n't believe that . He 's programmed to avoid non - correlation . ”
3483	3486	3488	3488	Handley	149	" Aubie , ”
3496	3505	3488	3488	Handley	149	“ have you ever examined that program carefully ? ”
3506	3511	3512	3513	the psychologist	1409	“ I wrote it , ”
3516	3524	3512	3513	the psychologist	1409	“ That is , the basic structure . ”
3525	3563	3564	3564	Auberson	145	“ Then you ought to know - it says that he must not lie . It says that he can not lie . But nowhere , nowhere does it say that he has to tell the truth ! ”
3569	3576	3564	3564	Auberson	145	“ It 's the same thing — "
3592	3654	3589	3589	Handley	149	“ He ca n't lie to you , Aubie - but he can mislead you . He can do it by withholding information . Oh , he 'll tell the truth if you ask him the right questions — he has to — but you have to know which questions to ask . He 's not going to volunteer the information . ”
3689	3693	3694	3694	he	145	“ But why ? ”
3697	3700	3701	3701	Handley	149	“ Why ? "
3706	3717	3701	3701	Handley	149	“ That 's what we 've got to find out . ”
4049	4052	4056	4056	YOU	145	“ Huh ? "
4091	4092	4056	4056	YOU	145	“ What?"-CLARIFY
4279	4286	4260	4260	He	145	“ Well ? Whaťd you find ? ”
4291	4296	4260	4260	He	145	" A hardware failure . ”
4297	4301	4302	4304	The design engineer	303	“ Uh uh . ”
4309	4321	4306	4306	his	303	“ I wo n't believe it . More likely the software . ”
4328	4335	4336	4336	Handley	149	“ Take a look for yourself . ”
4372	4382	4368	4368	Handley	149	“ I see he 's playing semantic games again . ”
4383	4424	4354	4354	Auberson	145	" He always does that . It 's the adolescent in him . Ask him what 's the matter , he 'll tell you that matter is a form of energy , a convenient way to store or use it . ”
4425	4428	4429	4429	Handley	149	“ Charming , ”
4434	4446	4429	4429	Handley	149	“ _ but I do n't see a mechanical failure here . ”
4447	4454	4354	4354	Auberson	145	" In the primary data units . ”
4455	4480	4429	4429	Handley	149	“ Uh uh . Systems analysis would show it if there was something wrong — and the monitor units do n't show a thing . "
4481	4491	4429	4429	Handley	149	" How about the increased activity from his inputs ? ”
4492	4523	4354	4354	Auberson	145	“ Ah , well , that 's only an increase in data transmission . Simultaneous with his periods of non - rationality there 's an electronic request for more information . ”
4524	4536	4429	4429	Handley	149	“ He 's getting garbage — and he asks for more ? ”
4537	4554	4429	4429	Handley	149	“ Maybe he 's hoping that more data will clarify the information he 's already got . ”
4555	4570	4354	4354	Auberson	145	“ And maybe more data will make him overload and blow his judgment circuits . "
4571	4575	4576	4576	Handley	149	" Uh uh , ”
4579	4586	4576	4576	Handley	149	“ HARLIE monitors his own inputs . ”
4587	4590	4354	4354	Auberson	145	" Huh ? "
4591	4599	4354	4354	Auberson	145	“ Yeah , did n't you know ? "
4600	4607	4576	4576	Handley	149	" No . When did this — "
4614	4648	4649	4649	Auberson	145	“ Just recently . It was a second - stage modification . After we were sure that the judgment circuits were operational , we began giving HARLIE control of his own internal systems . ”
4654	4664	4649	4649	Auberson	145	“ I think we ought to open him up . "
4665	4668	4354	4354	Auberson	145	“ Huh ? "
4669	4701	4354	4354	Auberson	145	“ Look , you said it yourself . HARLIE is trying to mislead us . Maybe he 's trying to hide the fact that there 's something wrong with him internally . ”
4702	4709	4710	4710	Auberson	145	“ Why would he do that ? ”
4713	4719	4710	4710	Auberson	145	“ I do n't know . ”
4726	4740	4721	4721	he	145	“ Have you ever had a parent or grandparent go senile on you ? ”
4741	4744	4354	4354	Auberson	145	" No . "
4745	4825	4354	4354	Auberson	145	" Well , I have . All of a sudden they become irrational . They wo n't go to a doctor . And if you can get them to one , they wo n't cooperate with him . They wo n't tell him what 's wrong because they 're afraid of an operation . They do n't want to be cut open . And they do n't want to die . Maybe HARLIE 's afraid of being turned off . ”
4826	4838	4721	4721	he	145	“ Could be . God knows you threaten him often enough . ”
4839	4849	4721	4721	he	145	“ Uh uh . He knows I 'm kidding . ”
4850	4854	4855	4855	Handley	149	“ Does he ? "
4858	4895	4855	4855	Handley	149	“ That 's like kidding a Jew about having a big nose and being tight with money . You know it 's a joke , he knows it 's a joke - but it still hurts . ”
4896	4936	4721	4721	he	145	“ Okay , so I wo n't kid him that way any more . But I still think we ought to check out his systems . We 've gone over his programs often enough and have n't found anything . "
4937	4961	4721	4721	he	145	“ All right . What time is it - Yike ! It 's almost three . I 'll have to work like crazy . ”
4962	4969	4970	4970	Auberson	145	" Let it go till tomorrow , ”
4975	5004	5005	5005	Handley	149	“ Clear his boards , set up what you 'll need , and close up early . That way you 'll have all day to work on him . ”
5008	5017	5018	5018	Auberson	145	“ Okay , you talked me into it . ”
5022	5025	5026	5026	he	145	“ Hey , ”
5030	5097	5026	5026	he	145	“ Did I tell you about this new highclub I discovered ? It 's called The Glass Trip . The walls , the floor , the ceiling are all one - way glass , and there 's a multi - phase light show behind each pane . So you 're looking into either an infinity of mirrors or an infinity of mindblowing lights . Or both . ”
5103	5117	5026	5026	he	145	" Sounds good . We 'll have to take it in some time . ”
5118	5125	5126	5126	Auberson	145	" Yeah . Maybe this weekend . ”
5161	5164	5165	5165	he	149	“ Well , ”
5178	5187	5165	5165	he	149	“ you 'd better start checking your programs . ”
5188	5195	5174	5174	Auberson	145	" You did n't find anything ? "
5196	5205	5165	5165	he	149	“ A dead fly . Want to see ? "
5206	5210	5165	5165	he	149	" No thanks . ”
5211	5235	5174	5174	Auberson	145	“ That 's all right . Jerry wants to show it to the maintenance crew . Wants to chew them out for it . ”
5236	5250	5165	5165	he	149	" And then he 'll probably put it up on the bulletin board . "
5251	5260	5261	5261	Auberson	145	" Are you kidding ? He collects 'em . ”
5264	5281	5261	5261	Auberson	145	“ Okay — but that still does n't solve the problem of HARLIE , does it ? ”
5282	5290	5165	5165	he	149	“ No . Want to come down ? ”
5291	5298	5261	5261	Auberson	145	“ I guess I 'd better . "
5340	5357	5329	5329	Auberson	145	“ Did you monitor any of his inputs during an actual period of non - rationality ? ”
5358	5380	5404	5404	HARLIE	145	" Uh , no , we did n't . Frankly , I did n't know how to go about triggering one . "
5381	5389	5329	5329	Auberson	145	“ I think there 's a way . ”
5390	5395	5329	5329	Auberson	145	“ You know something ? "
5396	5401	5402	5402	They	309	“ Just a guess . ”
5426	5435	5329	5329	Auberson	145	“ You still have your monitors set up ? "
5436	5439	5329	5329	Auberson	145	" Yeah . "
5440	5476	5509	5509	Auberson	145	“ All right , let 's try something . I 'm going to see if I can get HARLIE to become non - rational . When I do , let me know exactly what happens . "
5481	5484	5485	5485	Auberson	145	“ Right . ”
5721	5728	5729	5729	Handley	149	“ Looks like he 's balking , ”
5738	5744	5729	5729	Handley	149	“ Maybe he 's afraid . ”
5745	5751	5729	5729	Handley	149	" Could be . Shh . ”
5864	5875	5861	5861	Handley	149	“ I 'll be damned . HARLIE 's got taste . ”
5876	5882	5883	5883	Auberson	145	“ I 'm not surprised , ”
5905	5915	5897	5898	The other	316	“ Still think he 's getting it as garbage ? ”
5916	5941	5942	5942	he	145	" I 've already conceded that point to you . Go feed that stuff into him . I 'll stay here and be the , ”
5945	5949	5942	5942	he	145	“ — guru . ”
6113	6129	6135	6135	he	145	“ Why , the little bugger must be slipping . He just volunteered some information . ”
6295	6298	6299	6299	Auberson	145	" Handley , ”
6302	6307	6299	6299	Auberson	145	“ He wants more . ”
6308	6316	6299	6299	Auberson	145	" He 's on maximum feed now . "
6317	6321	6299	6299	Auberson	145	" Double it . ”
6322	6325	6299	6299	Auberson	145	" Huh ? "
6326	6339	6299	6299	Auberson	145	“ Do something . Plug in another unit . He wants more . ”
6340	6346	6299	6299	Auberson	145	" He wants an overload ? ”
6347	6371	6299	6299	Auberson	145	“ I think so . It 's only an effect , but in this case the effect may help to stimulate the cause . ”
6372	6375	6299	6299	Auberson	145	“ Huh ? "
6376	6384	6299	6299	Auberson	145	“ Never mind . Just do it . ”
6385	6389	6391	6391	Handley	151	" All right , ”
6393	6399	6391	6391	Handley	151	“ You 're the boss . ”
6511	6514	6516	6516	Handley	151	“ Whoops ! "
6518	6529	6516	6516	Handley	151	“ There he goes . And it 's a lallapaloozer ! ”
6620	6623	6609	6609	He	145	“ Well ? ”
6624	6646	6597	6597	Auberson	145	“ He 's really round the bend now . All his meters are way up , pushing close to dangerous overloads . "
6647	6652	6597	6597	Auberson	145	" But not quite ? ”
6653	6659	6609	6609	He	145	“ No , not quite . ”
6660	6665	6597	6597	Auberson	145	“ Hm . Fascinating . ”
6675	6689	6666	6666	Auberson	145	“ I would assume then that all of his inputs are becoming nonrational . ”
6690	6696	6697	6697	Handley	151	“ We 're checking now . ”
6748	6756	6757	6757	Auberson	145	“ Sir , we 've found it , "
6763	6774	6757	6757	Auberson	145	“ What is it ? What 's that white line ? ”
6775	6791	6871	6871	Auberson	145	“ That 's HARLIE , sir — that 's one of his internal monitor controls . ”
6792	6807	6757	6757	Auberson	145	“ What 's he trying to do ? Damp down the non - rationality ? "
6808	6813	6814	6815	The technician	323	“ No , sir . ”
6819	6828	6814	6815	The technician	323	“ It looks like he 's inducing it , ”
6834	6837	6839	6839	Handley	151	" Huh ? ”
6841	6863	6839	6839	Handley	151	“ That white line - that 's a local source of disruption , a random signal to scramble the data feed . ”
6864	6869	6871	6871	Auberson	145	“ I thought so , "
6873	6878	6871	6871	Auberson	145	“ I thought so . "
6879	6886	6887	6887	Handley	151	“ Check his other internal monitors , ”
6890	6898	6887	6887	Handley	151	“ Is this the only one or — "
6933	6941	6942	6944	one of them	325	" I ca n't figure it out , ”
6947	6975	6942	6944	one of them	325	“ He 's doing it himself . Anywhere he can , he 's disrupting the rationality of his inputs . He 's feeding them incorrect control data . "
6976	6986	6987	6987	Handley	151	" That 's not what those circuits are for , ”
6990	7000	6987	6987	Handley	151	“ They 're for internal correction . Not disruption . ”
7001	7006	7007	7007	Auberson	145	“ Makes no difference , ”
7011	7034	7035	7035	He	145	“ They can be used both ways . There is n't a tool built that ca n't be used as a weapon . "
7043	7057	7035	7035	He	145	“ Can you show me exactly what he 's doing to that data ? "
7058	7068	7070	7073	one of the techs	326	“ Sure , we can tap into the line , ”
7075	7095	7070	7073	one of the techs	326	“ But it 'll take a few minutes . Which do you want - visual , audio or print ? ”
7096	7117	7035	7035	He	145	“ All three . Let 's try the visual first - that should tell me what I want to know . "
7118	7122	7123	7124	The technician	323	" All right . ”
7136	7150	7131	7131	Handley	151	“ This may take a bit . You going to let him continue ? ”
7151	7163	7164	7164	They	329	“ Why not ? Want to see what he 's doing ? ”
7195	7199	7201	7201	Handley	151	“ You know , ”
7205	7218	7201	7201	Handley	151	“ This is n't bad . It communicates . It says something , ”
7219	7256	7164	7164	They	329	“ What it says is not what I 'm concerned with . What is he trying to do ? Is this the reason for his trips , or is it just a byproduct ? An accident ? ”
7257	7265	7266	7266	Handley	151	" The poetry has to be intentional , ”
7269	7282	7266	7266	Handley	151	“ It 's the logical result of all we 've been doing . "
7283	7313	7314	7314	Handley	151	“ Then answer me this . If this is what he 's doing during his periods of non - rationality , what does that make his periods of normalcy ? "
7318	7324	7325	7325	he	151	“ I do n't know , ”
7351	7361	7343	7346	One of the technicians	330	“ Sir , we 've got his inputs tapped . ”
7362	7366	7345	7346	the technicians	331	" Come on . ”
7380	7392	7367	7367	Auberson	145	“ Let 's take a look at what he 's receiving . "
7429	7437	7439	7439	Handley	151	“ ' Images upon my screen ... ' ”
7441	7444	7446	7447	the tech	332	" Huh ? "
7449	7456	7446	7447	the tech	332	“ Nothing . Just a poem . ”
7457	7460	7473	7474	the others	334	“ Oh . ”
7461	7469	7471	7474	one of the others	333	“ Looks like a damned light show , ”
7476	7484	7471	7474	one of the others	333	“ That 's exactly what it is , ”
7488	7558	7471	7474	one of the others	333	“ Look , he 's broken up the color television image into its component signals . The red has been reversed and the blue has been turned upside down ; the green is normal . Or something like that . It also looks like he 's done something with the contrast and the brightness - notice how rich the blacks are and how saturated with color the image is . ”
7584	7590	7581	7582	a technician	335	“ What about his audio ? ”
7591	7595	7596	7597	The man	336	“ Same thing . ”
7638	7681	7633	7634	The technician	323	“ He 's playing with the music the same way he did with the picture . He 's turned his bass notes high and his high notes low , stressing counterpoint and harmony instead of melody and rhythm . And so on . ”
7682	7704	7884	7887	one of the techs	326	" All right . I get the point . You can turn that noise off . Check his print scanners now . ”
7709	7722	7884	7887	one of the techs	326	“ He 's mixing his words up at random . Juggling them . ”
7723	7729	7633	7634	The technician	323	" Scrambling the letters too ? "
7730	7743	7633	7634	The technician	323	“ Occasionally - but mostly it 's the words . Sometimes sentences . ”
7744	7748	7750	7751	the psychologist	1409	“ Uh huh , "
7753	7758	7750	7751	the psychologist	1409	“ It all fits . ”
7759	7763	7765	7765	Handley	151	“ What does ? ”
7767	7773	7765	7765	Handley	151	“ What ’s he doing ? ”
7774	7780	7633	7634	The technician	323	" He 's tripping out . ”
7781	7786	7633	7634	The technician	323	“ We knew that , "
7787	7836	7765	7765	Handley	151	“ No , I mean literally tripping out . He 's distorting the perceptions WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE 21 of his sensory inputs . The same thing that anyone does who gets high . He 's trying to blow his mind by massive non - rational sensory overloads . "
7837	7843	7633	7634	The technician	323	“ Can we stop it ? "
7844	7872	7633	7634	The technician	323	“ Sure — just rip out his internal monitor controls so he ca n't create his own disruptions . That 's the cause of the whole thing . ”
7873	7882	7884	7887	one of the techs	326	“ Even that 's not necessary , sir , "
7889	7898	7884	7887	one of the techs	326	“ We can disconnect him on the boards . "
7899	7906	7633	7634	The technician	323	" All right . Do it . ”
7907	7912	7914	7914	Handley	151	“ Wait a minute , ”
7916	7938	7914	7914	Handley	151	“ If he 's high or drunk or whatever , and you suddenly bring him down - won't that be traumatic ? "
7944	7970	7939	7939	Auberson	145	“ It could be — but it could also leave him defenseless . We could find everything we want to know in a few minutes . "
8060	8069	8075	8075	Auberson	145	“ Any time you 're ready , sir . ”
8070	8073	8075	8075	Auberson	145	“ Okay , ”
8077	8080	8084	8084	he	145	“ Now ! ”
8382	8390	8341	8341	HARLIE	145	“ reevaluated the goals of the project . ”
8392	8394	8341	8341	HARLIE	145	“ reevaluation ”
8628	8663	8623	8623	Auberson	145	“ Listen , Elzer , it 's not necessary at all for any of those men or machines to be idle - you only have to reactivate HARLIE to put them back to work . ”
8697	8734	8690	8695	a beaver . Or a weasel	357	“ I would like to see them go back to work , yes — but the reason we 're here is to decide if the HARLIE project is the most useful work they could be doing . "
8735	8748	8810	8810	Elzer	167	“ One little setback and you want to discontinue the whole program ? ”
8749	8783	8690	8695	a beaver . Or a weasel	357	“ This is not just ' one little setback’-it 's one more in a long series of them . I voted for this stoppage because I think we should reevaluate this whole thing . "
8784	8809	8810	8810	Elzer	167	“ Well , we 're not going to get an answer to this question unless we reactivate HARLIE and ask him what he meant . ”
8816	8859	8810	8810	Elzer	167	“ I fail to understand your problem , Auberson . Why do you keep calling it ' he ? It 's only a machine . What could it have possibly ‘ meanť ? A machine 's only a machine - isn't it ? "
8860	8866	8867	8867	Auberson	145	" This one is n't , ”
8870	8876	8867	8867	Auberson	145	“ This one 's human . ”
8877	8880	8881	8881	Elzer	167	" Oh ? ”
8886	8895	8881	8881	Elzer	167	“ Are n't you exaggerating just a bit ? ”
8919	8940	8903	8903	He	145	“ Would somebody please tell this ... this high - priced bookkeeper just what the HARLIE project is all about ? ”
9088	9115	9116	9116	He	145	“ I 'm sure you can do it , Auberson . You know more about this piece of hardware than any of the rest of us . "
9134	9139	9142	9142	they	367	“ piece of hardware . ”
9154	9158	9159	9159	he	145	“ All right , ”
9162	9183	9159	9159	he	145	“ I will . The HARLIE project is the logical extension of Digby 's work with the variable brain path — ”
9184	9190	9192	9192	one	368	“ The variable brain path ? ”
9194	9255	9192	9192	one	368	“ The Mark IV judgment unit . Instead of base two , it uses base twelve . With compaction we can increase its precision by a power of twelve for each stage . First stage compaction is twelve squared , second stage is twelve cubed . Third stage compaction gives us twelve to the fourth power or 20,736 possible choices . ”
9256	9262	9264	9264	Elzer	167	“ You 've lost me , ”
9266	9273	9264	9264	Elzer	167	“ Now tell it in English . ”
9286	9296	9297	9297	He	145	“ I assume you mean one - syllable words ? ”
9305	9450	9451	9451	he	145	“ Binary code means your machine can make only two possible decisions - on or off , ' yes ' or ' no . ' There 's no possibility for ‘ mostly yes , ' ' somewhat yes , ' ‘ slightly yes , ' ' maybe yes , ' ‘ maybe yes and maybe no , ' ' maybe no,''slightly no , ' ' somewhat no , ' ‘ mostly no'-there 's no selectivity . It 's either / or . By increasing the number of choices you increase the range of the machine 's judgment . Base three gives you ‘ yes , ’ ‘ no , ' and ‘ maybe . ' Base five adds ‘ slightly yes ' and ' slightly no . Give it base ten to work with and it 's a pretty selective system . Base ten , ”
9454	9462	9463	9463	He	145	“ is the system most people use . ”
9476	9490	9463	9463	He	145	“ See ? Ten fingers . That 's if you count on them . ”
9498	9556	9495	9495	He	145	“ We use base twelve in the judgment units for mathematical reasons . It eliminates some of the problems inherent in using tens . The nearest way I can explain it is that twelve diWHEN HARLIE WAS ONE 25 vides into neater pieces . Ask a mathematician sometime about the advantages of base twelve over base ten . ”
9557	9561	9563	9563	Clintwood	170	" Got that , ”
9565	9574	9563	9563	Clintwood	170	“ How do you do it with computers ? "
9575	9598	9495	9495	He	145	" You mean the circuitry ? I 'm not sure I can answer that . I do n't know enough about it . ”
9599	9607	9608	9610	the younger man	369	“ Can you give me an idea ? "
9613	9622	9608	9610	the younger man	369	" Well , are you familiar with fluidics ? ”
9623	9627	9495	9495	He	145	“ Sort of . ”
9638	9803	9635	9635	Auberson	145	“ Fluidics is a term used to describe computers or computer circuits based on the flow of a liquid or gas , rather than on the flow of electricity . Just as a transistor uses a small current to modify a large one , a fluidic circuit can use a small flow of liquid to modify a bigger one . There 's an important difference , though . An electric circuit is either / or ; either the circuit is on or it 's off . With fluidics , however , you can vary the force of the modifying flow and vary the modification of the bigger . You can push the ' currenť to be modified all the way over to the ' yes ' side or to any notch in between . Because your major flow responds in proportion to the force of the modifying flow , you can have your full range of ' yes ' to ' no ' responses . "
9942	10072	10332	10332	Auberson	145	" The judgment circuit is the electronic equivalent of a fluidic unit . It measures the voltage , or pressure , of an electrical current and responds in degree to it . It 's very much like the way the human nervous system works . If a nerve cell releases a strong enough charge , it 's enough to set off the nerve cell next to it . Our judgment units do the same kind of thing ; that 's how we can duplicate the action of a fluidic unit - or more importantly , of the 26 WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE human brain . With hyper - state layering , we can compress the circuitry into a size comparable to that of an equivalent piece of brain tissue . ”
10090	10098	10087	10087	his	170	“ You used another term . Compaction ? "
10099	10102	10104	10104	Auberson	145	“ Right , ”
10106	10190	10104	10104	Auberson	145	“ Compaction is the term we use for giving the unit a second level of judgment circuits . It increases the number of choices by one power of the base number - twelve times twelve gives one hundred and forty - four choices in any given situation . One hundred and forty - four degrees between ' yes ' and ' no ' Want more precision , increase the number of levels . Each level increases the number of choices by twelve times . ”
10191	10203	10087	10087	his	170	“ Does n't that run into an awful lot of circuitry ? "
10204	10310	10087	10087	his	170	“ No . We can use the same circuits for almost any level of judgment . All the machine has to do is keep straight which is which . The machine makes a choice , decides it is n't precise enough , shifts down one level and runs the thing through the same circuitry again . Thať s compaction . It allows us to get a high degree of precision with a lot less circuitry , most of which is n't needed that often . If Handley were here , he could explain it . Don Handley is the design engineer on the HARLIE project . ”
10311	10318	10320	10320	Elzer	167	“ You ca n't explain it ? "
10323	10331	10332	10332	Auberson	145	" I can explain what I know , "
10338	10359	10332	10332	Auberson	145	" I thought you knew what HARLIE was . You are the chief of the project , are n't you ? ”
10360	10391	10392	10392	He	167	" I 'm a research psychologist , not an engineer . Anything I 've picked up about computers , I 've had to learn specifically on this project . I _ ”
10412	10421	10422	10424	The little man	356	“ Elzer , do you drive a car ? "
10428	10434	10422	10424	The little man	356	“ Yes , of course . ”
10435	10439	10332	10332	Auberson	145	“ What kind ? "
10440	10444	10422	10424	The little man	356	" A Continental . ”
10445	10453	10422	10424	The little man	356	“ This year 's , I suppose ? "
10454	10459	10460	10460	He	167	“ That 's right . ”
10465	10484	10460	10460	He	167	“ You knew that its Thorsen Auto - Pilot was one of our units , did n't you ? ”
10499	10547	10422	10424	The little man	356	“ It was made possible by the variable - path circuits that we 've been producing for the past four years and marketing as the WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE 27 Mark IV . Basically , that 's a simplified version of one type of HARLIE function module . "
10548	10558	10422	10424	The little man	356	" You mean HARLIE 's a giant judgment circuit ? ”
10559	10703	10460	10460	He	167	" HARLIE is a human brain — with solid - state circuitry instead of organic nerves . We use the judgment circuits to duplicate the human functions . The important part of the human brain is actually a series of very complex judgment paths . They do n't work exactly the same as HARLIE 's , but close enough . The difference is in mechanisms , not basic principles . If a nerve impulse is strong enough , it can trigger other nerves around it ; the number of nerves reporting allows the brain to interpret the strength of the original stimulus . HARLIE 's circuits work the same way . The strength of the ' yes ' impulses ( or ‘ on ' circuits ) determines the interpretation . Just for HARLIE to complete one thought involves several thousand compacted judgment boxes . ”
10704	10717	10718	10718	Clintwood	170	" Uh , what stage of compaction are HARLIE 's judgment boxes ? "
10721	10771	10718	10718	Clintwood	170	" It 's adjustable , depending on the precision HARLIE wants to bring to any one problem . Or needs to . It 's a matter of how many times a decision can be subdivided before such precision becomes redundant . He has a judgment unit to control it . ”
10785	10796	10781	10781	Elzer	167	“ It 's still a computer , is n't it ? ”
10811	10828	10797	10797	Auberson	145	“ Yes , in the same sense that your brain is equivalent to a toad 's . ”
10854	10866	10872	10872	he	167	“ Here now ! Here now ! We 'll have quiet . ”
10875	10890	10872	10872	he	167	" Auberson , if you ca n't keep your personal opinions out of this — "
10891	10957	10872	10872	he	167	“ Mr. Dome - Chairman Dome - I did not mean the comment as an insult to Mr. Elzer . I was assuming that Mr. Elzer 's brain was better , more complex than a toad 's . Assuming that he has an average human brain , he is as far above a toad as HARLIE is above a simplified auto - pilot judgment circuit . ”
10963	10966	10967	10967	Auberson	145	“ However , "
10971	11021	10967	10967	Auberson	145	" if Mr. Elzer feels that there is not enough difference between his brain and that of a toad , I 'll have to use some other comparison 28 WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE -hopefully one not so open to misinterpretation . Did you get all that , Miss Stimson ? ”
11042	11053	11054	11054	he	145	“ There is a significant difference that I might note , ”
11063	11074	11054	11054	he	145	“ HARLIE uses all of his brain . . . . ”
11090	11203	11086	11086	he	175	“ Estimates vary , but we figure that the average human being uses only ten to fifteen percent of his available brain cells . We could n't afford that kind of luxury with HARLIE , so we built him to use his total brain capacity . He 's not as complex as a human brain - he has nowhere near the same number of ' cells,'—but he can still function quite well at human levels . Building HARLIE taught us quite a bit about the workings of the human brain . In fact , we were surprised to find out that in many ways it 's simpler than we thought it was . "
11335	11336	11354	11354	HARLIE	145	” “
11339	11343	11354	11354	HARLIE	145	" asked Elzer . “

11446	11626	11434	11434	HARLIE	145	“ When Handley came on the project , though , its direction changed ; the goal became even more lofty . Or maybe I should say , the way to achieve the goal involved an even greater challenge than we had originally thought . Look , you have to understand what Don was up to before he came here . He 'd been doing research WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE 29 with a neuro - psychology team down in Houston ; they 'd been diagramming the basic pattern structures of the human brain . Have you ever seen the schematic of a thought ? Don has . Do you know how to program a human brain ? Don does . That 's what he was working on before he came here . Anyway , when they started to design HARLIE — he was called JudgNaut One then - Handley was struck by the similarity of the schematics to those of the human brain . The basic judgment paths were too much alike for the thought patterns not to be similar . “
11719	11720	11721	11721	You	149	" "
11724	11730	11721	11721	You	149	“ it was to be , "
11731	11735	11721	11721	You	149	” said Elzer . “

11822	11826	11811	11812	His mentor	388	” snorted Elzer . “
11871	11872	11875	11877	a mechanical godfather	390	” "
11879	11883	11885	11885	you	391	” said Elzer . "

12009	12013	12000	12000	you	391	" interrupted Elzer , “
12028	12051	12017	12017	you	391	” entor . His mentor ? To be its babe original problems 30 WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE Auberson decided to ignore that . “
12083	12091	12080	12080	I	0	” His flippancy was wasted on Elzer . “
12101	12113	12094	12094	you	391	" Auberson could see what was coming . But he said , “
12140	12147	12138	12138	HARLIE	145	” Elzer pounced on it anyway . “
12151	12161	12138	12138	HARLIE	145	” he said to the rest of the Board . “
12184	12197	12169	12182	a man in charge of this project who does n't even care about it	395	” Auberson was on his feet at that . Dorne was saying , “
12204	12216	12217	12217	Elzer	175	“ When we lost Digby we should have closed it down , ”
12220	12231	12217	12217	Elzer	175	“ All we have left are Indians and no Chief . ”
12232	12236	12237	12237	Auberson	145	" Hold on there ”
12240	12259	12237	12237	Auberson	145	“ You 're misquoting me -I do care about this project . It 's all I care about — "
12260	12272	12217	12217	Elzer	175	“ You do n't seem to be able to handle it though- "
12273	12289	12217	12217	Elzer	175	“ You do n't even understand what we 're trying to dol How can you — "
12290	12295	12296	12296	Dorne	172	“ Auberson ! Elzer ! "
12304	12319	12296	12296	Dorne	172	“ Cut it out — both of you ! This is a business meeting . "
12332	12351	12352	12352	He	145	“ Psychology , Mr. Elzer , is not as cut - and - dried a subject as bookkeeping . ”
12377	12395	12373	12373	himself	145	“ Robot psychology is still an infant science . We do n't know what we 're doing — ”
12410	12445	12373	12373	himself	145	“ Let me put it another way . We do n't know if what we 're doing is the right thing to do . HARLIE 's psychology is not the same as human psychology . ”
12446	12466	12352	12352	He	145	" I thought you said HARLIE was human - and that he duplicates every function of the human brain . "
12467	12581	12373	12373	himself	145	“ He is and he does — but how many human beings do you know who are immobile , who never sleep , who have twenty - five sensory inputs , who have eidetic memories , who have no concept of taste or smell or any other organic chemical reactions ? How many human beings do you know who have no sense of touch ? And no sex life ? In other words , Mr. Elzer , HARLIE may originally have had WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE 31 a human psychology , but his environment has forced certain modifications upon it . And on top of that , HARLIE has a most volatile personality . ”
12582	12585	12586	12588	The little man	356	“ Volatile ? ”
12592	12599	12586	12588	The little man	356	“ You mean he gets angry ? "
12600	12742	12373	12373	himself	145	“ Angry ? No , not angry . He can get impatient though - especially with human beings . There 's reason to believe that HARLIE has both an ego and an id - a conscious and a subconscious . His superego , I believe , takes the form of his external programming . My commands , if you will . Aside from that , we have n't found any other inhibitions . In any case , if this is true , it 's only his superego that we have any control over . His ego cooperates because it wants to , and his i d , assuming he has one , does like any human subconscious — whatever it damn well wants . We have to know what that is before we can stop his periods of non - rationality . ”
12743	12750	12752	12752	Elzer	175	“ This is all very interesting , ”
12762	12777	12752	12752	Elzer	175	“ But would you get to the point ? What is HARLIE 's purpose ? ”
12778	12781	12782	12782	Auberson	145	“ Purpose ? ”
12785	12829	12782	12782	Auberson	145	“ His purpose ? It 's very funny you should ask that . The whole reason for this stoppage is that HARLIE asked me what your purpose is . Excuse me , our purpose . HARLIE wants to know what our purpose is . ”
12830	12838	12839	12839	Dorne	172	“ That 's for theologians to discuss , ”
12843	12868	12839	12839	Dorne	172	“ If you want , I 'm sure Miss Stimson here can arrange for a minister to come in and speak to the machine . ”
12881	12902	12878	12879	Miss Stimson	171	“ What we want to know is HARLIE 's purpose . Having built him , you should have some idea . ”
12903	12926	12782	12782	Auberson	145	“ I thought I 'd made it clear . HARLIE was built to duplicate the functions of the human brain . Electronically . ”
12927	12937	12839	12839	Dorne	172	“ Yes , we know that . But why ? ”
12938	12941	12942	12942	Auberson	145	“ Why ? ”
12948	12951	12942	12942	Auberson	145	“ Why ? ”
12958	13017	12839	12839	Dorne	172	“ Because it had to be done . HARLIE will help us learn more about how the human brain works . There 's still a lot we do n't know yet , especially in the area of psychology . We hope to learn how much of the human personality is the programming and how much is the hardware . ”
13018	13024	13026	13026	Elzer	175	" I beg your pardon , "
13028	13034	13026	13026	Elzer	175	“ I do n't understand . ”
13035	13043	13044	13044	Auberson	145	“ I did n't think you would , ”
13048	13096	13044	13044	Auberson	145	“ We 're curious as to which of the functions of the brain are natural and which are artificial - how many of the human actions are determined 32 WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE from within and how many are reactions to what is coming in from without . ”
13097	13102	13026	13026	Elzer	175	" Instinct versus environment ? ”
13103	13110	13111	13111	Auberson	145	" You could call it that , ”
13127	13137	13121	13121	you	401	“ And for what reason are we doing this ? ”
13138	13146	13026	13026	Elzer	175	“ I thought I just told you — "
13147	13164	13026	13026	Elzer	175	“ I mean , for what financial reason ? What economic applications will this program have ? ”
13165	13182	13121	13121	you	401	" Huh ? It 's too early to think of that . This is still pure research ”
13183	13192	13193	13193	Auberson	145	“ Ah ha - so you admit it ! ”
13197	13202	13193	13193	Auberson	145	“ I admit nothing . "
13207	13210	13211	13211	he	175	“ Dornie , ”
13215	13262	13263	13263	He	175	“ this just proves it . He does n't care about the project - he does n't care about the company . He 's only interested in research , and we ca n't afford this kind of costly project . Not without return we ca n't . ”
13275	13304	13265	13265	his	175	“ If Mr. Auberson and his friends had wanted to build artificial brains , they should have applied for a grant . I move we discontinue the project . ”
13311	13318	13305	13305	Auberson	145	“ Mr. Chairman ! Mr. Chairman ! "
13319	13338	13265	13265	his	175	“ You 're out of order , Aubie . Now sit down . You 'll get your chance . "
13339	13350	13384	13384	He	172	“ Dammit , this is a railroad job ! This little ”
13351	13357	13358	13358	Dorne	172	“ Aubie , sit down ! ”
13366	13383	13384	13384	He	172	“ There 's a motion on the floor . I assume it 's a formal proposal ? ”
13392	13395	13389	13389	Elzer	175	“ Discussion ? ”
13404	13407	13398	13398	Auberson	145	“ Aubie ? "
13408	13426	13427	13427	Elzer	175	“ On what grounds ? I want to know what grounds he has for discontinuing the project . ”
13431	13444	13427	13427	Elzer	175	“ Well , for one thing , HARLIE has already cost us — ”
13445	13485	13398	13398	Auberson	145	" If you 'll check your figures , you 'll find that the whole HARLIE project is well within the projected overage . In fact , because we budgeted for that overage , we are well within acceptable limits . ”
13486	13495	13497	13497	Dorne	172	" He 's got you there , Carl , ”
13499	13537	13497	13497	Dorne	172	" If you had let me finish my sentence , I would have shown you WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE that it has cost us far too much already for a project that is incapable of showing results . ”
13538	13541	13542	13542	Auberson	145	“ Results ? ”
13545	13572	13542	13542	Auberson	145	“ Results ? We were getting results even before HARLIE was completed . Who do you think designed the secondary and tertiary stages ? HARLIE did . ”
13573	13577	13578	13578	Elzer	167	“ So what ? ”
13582	13592	13578	13578	Elzer	167	“ He 's not working right , is he ? ”
13593	13604	13542	13542	Auberson	145	“ That 's just it - HARLIE is working perfectly . "
13605	13624	13542	13542	Auberson	145	" Huh ? Then what about these periods of non - rationality ? Why is he shut down ? "
13625	13628	13629	13629	Auberson	145	" Because , "
13640	13660	13629	13629	Auberson	145	“ Because we were n't prepared for him to be so perfectly human . If perfect is the word . ”
13682	13730	13731	13731	Elzer	167	“ We had designed him to be human , we had built him to be human , we had even programmed him to think like a humanthen we turned him on and expected him to act like a machine . Well , surprise . He did n't . ”
13734	13743	13731	13731	Elzer	167	“ The nature of the trouble then ... ? "
13744	13752	13753	13753	Auberson	145	“ Human error , if you will . ”
13791	13795	13796	13796	he	145	“ Human error ? ”
13799	13831	13796	13796	he	145	“ Yours or HARLIE 's ? Or both - each compounding each ? I suppose you 're going to blame his periods of non - rationality on human error as well . ”
13832	13846	13915	13915	Elzer	167	“ Why not ? How else would you characterize our approach to them ? ”
13847	13865	13866	13866	Auberson	145	“ ' Human error ' is an over - polite euphemism for what I would call it . ”
13870	13914	13866	13866	Auberson	145	“ We 'd thought his non - rationality was a physical problem , or perhaps a programming error . We were wrong . He was neither physically nor mentally ill . He was — I almost hate to say it - emotionally upset . "
13920	13952	13915	13915	Elzer	167	" His periods of non - rationality were / are triggered by something that 's bothering him . We do n't know what that is , but we can find out . ”
13979	13994	13957	13957	He	167	“ Anthropomorphism . Auberson 's projecting his own problems onto those of the machine . ”
13995	14028	13957	13957	He	167	“ Elzer , you 're a fool . Look , if you had to go down to that computer room right now and talk to HARLIE , how would you treat him ? "
14029	14039	14040	14040	Auberson	145	" Huh ? Like a machine , of course . ”
14050	14083	14040	14040	Auberson	145	“ No , I mean , if you sat down at a console and had to carry on a conversation with him , who would you think was at the other end ? ”
14084	14088	14089	14091	The little man	356	“ The machine . ”
14108	14217	14218	14218	He	145	“ That 's the human error I mentioned . HARLIE is not a machine . He is a human being , with the abilities and reactions of one , allowing of course for his environment . When you speak to him via the typers it is quite easy to assume him to be a normal healthy human being ; he is a rational individual , and he has a distinct and definite personality . It 's impossible for me to think of him as anything but human . However , even I had made a mistake . I had n't asked myself ' how old is HARLIE ? ' ”
14255	14261	14262	14262	he	145	“ We 'd been thinking , "
14265	14388	14262	14262	he	145	“ that HARLIE was a thirty- or forty - year - old man . Or we thought of him as being the same age as ourselves . Or no age at all . How old is Mickey Mouse ? We did n't think about it - and that was our mistake . HARLIE 's a child . An adolescent , if you prefer . He 's reached that point in life where he has a pretty good idea of the nature of the world and his relation to it . He is now ready to act like any other adolescent and question the setup . We were thinking we had an Instant Einstein , when actually we 've got an enfant terrible . ”
14389	14397	14399	14399	Dome	174	“ His periods of non - rationality ? "
14401	14423	14399	14399	Dome	174	“ An adolescent drug trip - the reaction to our irrationalities . He 's discovered pot - or its electronic equivalent . "
14424	14437	14439	14439	Elzer	167	“ Do n't you think that 's grounds enough for dismantling him ? ”
14441	14454	14455	14455	Auberson	145	“ Would you kill your son if you caught him taking acid ? ”
14459	14472	14455	14455	Auberson	145	“ Of course not . I 'd try to straighten him out — "
14484	14506	14476	14478	ONE 35 adolescent	409	" Oh ? And what about the Highmasters in your cigarette case ? He 'd only be imitating his old man . ”
14507	14516	14517	14517	Auberson	145	" Acid and pot are two different things . ”
14520	14614	14517	14517	Auberson	145	“ The difference is in degree , not in kind . HARLIE 's only been doing what everyone else in his environment has - tripping out . It 's what any adolescent does ; he was looking for a role model . In this case , he chose me . It was a logical choice ; I was the closest one to him . He saw that I was high most of the time , so he decided to experiment with it himself . Or as near as he could get to it . ”
14615	14627	14628	14628	Elzer	167	“ Yes , your fondness for the weed has been noticed , ”
14632	14637	14628	14628	Elzer	167	“ Among other things — "
14638	14692	14517	14517	Auberson	145	“ Then perhaps you 've also noticed that I have n't smoked anything since we started these sessions . And I do n't intend to start again while HARLIE is using me for a model . I 've got to keep my head about me . It took HARLIE to show me that . ”
14693	14702	14703	14703	Elzer	167	“ We 've gone off on a tangent , ”
14707	14725	14703	14703	Elzer	167	“ I believe there 's still a motion on the floor . I call for the vote . ”
14726	14735	14736	14736	Auberson	145	" You still have n't answered my question , ”
14739	14743	14736	14736	Auberson	145	“ What question ? ”
14744	14756	14703	14703	Elzer	167	“ On what grounds can you justify discontinuing the HARLIE project ? ”
14757	14762	14703	14703	Elzer	167	" It 's unprofitable . ”
14763	14811	14736	14736	Auberson	145	“ Unprofitable ... ? For God 's sake , man ! Give it a chance . Sure we have n't shown any profits yet , but we will eventually . I do n't know how , but we will if you 'll just give us that chance . "
14812	14823	14736	14736	Auberson	145	“ I object to throwing away good money after bad . ”
14824	14866	14867	14869	The little man	356	“ Dammit , Elzer - we're just beginning to understand what we 've got in HARLIE . If you shut him down now , you 'll be setting back computer science to ... to ... to I do n't know when . ”
14872	14881	14867	14869	The little man	356	“ I think you overestimate your own importance . ”
14882	14924	14736	14736	Auberson	145	“ All right , then let 's try this one . I 've told you several times already that HARLIE is human . If you try to have him shut down , I 'll bring charges against you for attempted murder . "
14925	14930	14932	14932	he	356	" You could n't . ”
14936	14942	14943	14943	Dorne	172	“ Want to find out ? ”
14947	14978	14979	14979	He	172	“ That 's a legal question that we 'll let the lawyers fight out . Or rather , we 're going to keep the lawyers from ever getting that far . ”
14984	15008	14979	14979	He	172	“ We 'll go 36 WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE into it later . The point is that HARLIE is a drain on corporate funds ”
15009	15021	15072	15073	the chairman	412	“ We 're budgeted for him for the next three years . ”
15022	15030	15031	15031	Dome	174	“ — a drain on corporate funds , ”
15034	15067	15031	15031	Dome	174	“ with no immediate prospect of return . It 's not how successful your research has been that we 're concerned with . It 's whether or not we want to continue . ”
15081	15085	15086	15086	he	145	“ All right , ”
15090	15099	15086	15086	he	145	“ What do you want me to do ? "
15100	15105	15108	15108	Elzer	167	“ Show a profit , "
15120	15156	15117	15117	Dorne	172	“ Show us a plan . Where are you going with HARLIE ? What are you going to do with him ? And most of all , what is he going to do for us ? ”
15157	15169	15117	15117	Dorne	172	“ I 'm not sure I can answer that right now ... "
15170	15178	15179	15179	Auberson	145	" How much time do you need ? ”
15182	15188	15179	15179	Auberson	145	“ I ca n't say . "
15189	15200	15201	15201	Elzer	167	“ Why do n't you ask HARLIE for the answer ? ”
15209	15220	15204	15204	Auberson	145	“ I believe I will . I believe I will . ”
15488	15496	15499	15499	Stimson	171	“ Hi , can I join you ? ”
15505	15508	15499	15499	Stimson	171	" Sure . ”
15530	15539	15540	15540	she	171	" Rough one today , was n't it ? ”
15565	15582	15560	15560	she	171	“ Oh , come on , Auberson , relax . I was only making small talk . ”
15643	15650	15651	15651	he	145	“ I 'd like to relax , "
15654	15666	15651	15651	he	145	“ But I ca n't . This thing is too important . ”
15673	15679	15670	15670	he	145	“ To me , anyway . ”
15680	15684	15670	15670	he	145	" I know . "
15685	15689	15690	15690	He	145	“ Do you ? "
15739	15763	15729	15729	He	145	“ HARLIE is like a ... a ... I know it sounds hokey — but he 's like a child , a son . ”
15764	15779	15720	15720	her	171	“ I know . I 've read the company doctor 's report on you . "
15780	15783	15784	15784	His	145	“ Huh ? "
15789	15795	15784	15784	His	145	“ I did n't know — "
15796	15828	15720	15720	her	171	“ Of course not . Nobody ever knows when we do a psychiatric report on them . It 'd be bad policy . Anyway , you do n't have to worry . "
15829	15832	15833	15833	She	171	" Oh ? ”
15838	15871	15835	15835	her	171	“ Oh , it did mention your introvertedness -and let 's see , what else — there was something about your worrying too much because you take on too much responsibility and ... ”
15888	15901	15872	15872	She	171	“ You should n't be telling me all this , should you ? ”
15902	15909	15910	15910	Her	171	“ Does it make a difference ? ”
15922	15936	15910	15910	Her	171	" No , I guess not . What else was in the report ? ”
15937	15971	15872	15872	She	171	" He said you were becoming overly involved with the HARLIE project , but that such a development was almost unavoidable . Whoever became HARLIE 's mentor would have found himself emotionally attached . "
15972	15975	15976	15976	Auberson	145	“ Mm , ”
15979	15989	15976	15976	Auberson	145	" So you think HARLIE will have an answer ? "
16003	16018	16000	16000	he	145	“ Is that why you sat down here ? To pump me for information ? ”
16023	16053	16054	16054	she	171	" I 'm sorry you think that . No , I sat down here because I thought you might want to talk - might want someone to talk to , ”
16195	16200	16201	16201	he	145	“ I 'm sorry , "
16204	16222	16201	16201	he	145	“ I 've been under pressure . And when I 'm pressured I get moody and irritable . "
16223	16234	16281	16281	She	171	“ I know . That was in the report too . "
16235	16246	16281	16281	She	171	“ Is there anything that was n't in the report ? ”
16247	16261	16201	16201	he	145	“ Only whether you like your steak rare , medium or well done . ”
16262	16265	16266	16266	he	145	“ Rare , ”
16271	16280	16281	16281	She	171	“ Hey , was that a dinner invitation ? ”
16294	16313	16281	16281	She	171	“ No , I 'm sorry . It was just the first thing that popped into my head . ”
16314	16319	16320	16320	He	145	“ Oh , okay . ”
16326	16338	16320	16320	He	145	" You are n't going to answer me , are you ? ”
16339	16342	16343	16343	He	145	" Huh ? ”
16349	16353	16343	16343	He	145	“ About what ? "
16354	16358	16320	16320	He	145	“ About HARLIE . ”
16359	16364	16320	16320	He	145	“ What about him ? "
16365	16379	16343	16343	He	145	“ Do you think you can find out what Dorne wants you to ? "
16385	16391	16398	16398	he	145	" I do n't know . ”
16401	16413	16414	16414	He	145	“ I still do n't know what to say to him . ”
16420	16426	16427	16427	He	145	“ Here , read this . ”
16448	16455	16456	16456	she	171	“ That 's quite a question , ”
16459	16472	16456	16456	she	171	" Uh huh . I wish I knew how to answer it . ”
16479	16506	16473	16474	Miss Stimson	171	“ My father 's a rabbi . He 's been one for twenty - seven years . And he 's still not sure of the answer . ”
16507	16514	16456	16456	she	171	“ Maybe that 's the answer . ”
16515	16519	16456	16456	she	171	“ What is ? ”
16520	16533	16473	16474	Miss Stimson	171	“ That our purpose is to find out what our purpose is . ”
16534	16542	16456	16456	she	171	“ And what happens when we do ? ”
16543	16558	16456	16456	she	171	“ I do n't know . I guess we 'll have completed our task . ”
16559	16566	16567	16567	she	171	“ And then we get reprogrammed ? ”
16570	16586	16567	16567	she	171	" Or dismantled . Maybe there 's a Cosmic Elzer just waiting for the opportunity . ”
16592	16603	16587	16587	She	171	“ Then we 're in trouble already , Mr. Auberson . ”
16630	16678	16606	16606	she	171	“ Because if that 's true , then your realization of what our purpose is completes the task of finding out . Maybe someone up there — or out there - is listening to us right now , trying to decide whether or not to dismantle us . ”
16683	16686	16606	16606	she	171	“ Hmm ... "
16687	16707	16708	16708	He	426	" Whatever our purpose , we probably are n't fulfilling it . We 're not functioning as we should . ”
16713	16719	16708	16708	He	426	“ How should we function ? ”
16720	16725	16726	16726	She	171	“ Like human beings . ”
16731	16760	16726	16726	She	171	" Is n't that what the human race is already doing ? Functioning like human beings - squabbling with each other , killing each other , hating ... ? "
16761	16767	16606	16606	she	171	“ That 's not human . ”
16768	16780	16606	16606	she	171	“ Oh , but it is . It 's very human . ”
16781	16792	16726	16726	She	171	" Well , it 's not what human should be . ”
16793	16818	16726	16726	She	171	" Now that 's a different story . You 're not talking about what people are , but what you want them to be . "
16819	16846	16606	16606	she	171	“ Well , maybe we should be what we are n't because what we are now is n't good enough . Maybe we should be dismantled . ”
16847	16870	16726	16726	She	171	" I do n't think we have to worry too much about somebody up there doing it - we're doing it ourselves . ”
16876	16893	16726	16726	She	171	“ That 's the best reason of all why we should be better than we are . ”
16894	16897	16898	16898	he	145	“ Okay , ”
16901	16922	16898	16898	he	145	“ I agree with you . Now , how do we do it ? How do we make people better ? ”
16938	16955	16931	16931	she	431	“ That 's the same kind of question HARLIE asked . It ca n't be answered . ”
16956	16959	16960	16960	he	145	“ No , ”
16963	16971	16960	16960	he	145	“ It ca n't be answered easily . ”
16994	17012	17013	17013	Auberson	145	“ Mm , how are you going to answer it - HARLIE 's question , I mean . ”
17018	17025	17015	17015	his	145	“ Have n't got the slightest . ”
17026	17033	17013	17013	Auberson	145	" Can I offer a suggestion ? ”
17034	17042	17013	17013	Auberson	145	" Why not ? Everybody else has . ”
17043	17051	17015	17015	his	145	“ Oh , I did n't mean — "
17052	17069	17013	17013	Auberson	145	“ No , I 'm sorry . Go ahead . Maybe you can add something new . ”
17070	17076	17077	17077	He	145	“ You 're that desperate ? "
17089	17095	17077	17077	He	145	“ I 'm that desperate . "
17096	17120	17013	17013	Auberson	145	“ Well , okay . You said that HARLIE was a child , did n't you ? Why not treat him as such ? ”
17121	17134	17013	17013	Auberson	145	“ Huh ? I follow you and I do n't follow you . "
17135	17143	17144	17144	she	432	" It 's not only the problem , ”
17147	17192	17144	17144	she	432	“ It 's also the answer . Look - suppose you had a son about eight years old and , uh , suppose he was advanced for his age . I mean , suppose he was doing twelfth - grade work and so on . ”
17193	17200	17013	17013	Auberson	145	“ Okay . I 'm supposing . "
17201	17252	17013	17013	Auberson	145	" Good . Now suppose one day you find out he 's got an incurable disease - say , leukemia - one of the rarer forms they still have n't licked . What are you going to say to him when he asks you what it 's like to die ? "
17253	17256	17258	17258	Auberson	145	“ Um , ”
17260	17277	17258	17258	Auberson	145	" No copping out now . He 's smart enough to know what the situation is — ”
17278	17290	17013	17013	Auberson	145	“ — But emotionally , he 's only eight years old . ”
17291	17294	17013	17013	Auberson	145	“ Right . ”
17295	17304	17305	17305	He	145	" I 'm beginning to see your point . ”
17310	17323	17305	17305	He	145	“ If he was your son , what would you tell him ? "
17324	17328	17329	17329	she	433	“ The truth , ”
17332	17356	17329	17329	she	433	“ Sure ! But what is the truth ? That 's the whole problem with HARLIE 's question . We do n't know . ”
17362	17391	17392	17392	He	145	“ You do n't know the answer to your eight - year - old 's question either . You do n't know what it 's like to die . ”
17402	17410	17399	17399	She	433	“ So what would you tell him ? ”
17411	17417	17399	17399	She	433	" I do n't know . ”
17418	17439	17329	17329	she	433	" You do n't know what you 'd tell him ? Or you 'd tell him you do n't know ? "
17440	17442	17399	17399	She	433	“ Uh- ”
17443	17447	17399	17399	She	433	“ The latter , ”
17454	17510	17511	17511	He	434	“ You 'd tell him nobody knows . But you 'd also tell him what you were sure ofthat it does n't hurt and that it 's nothing to be afraid of , that it happens to everybody sooner or later . In other words , Mr. Auberson , you 'd be honest with him . ”
17561	17566	17558	17558	He	434	“ Call me David . ”
17571	17577	17558	17558	He	434	“ And I 'm Annie . ”
17690	17698	17700	17700	Auberson	145	“ Okay . Let 's try it , ”
18316	18318	18331	18331	Auberson	145	“ UNREAL ”
18621	18623	18609	18609	HARLIE	145	“ unreal ”
20855	20858	20837	20837	YOU	474	" FINGER COUNTER ”
20945	20951	20942	20942	Dorne	172	“ Sit down , Auberson . ”
20983	20986	20987	20987	he	172	“ Well ? ”
20990	20994	20987	20987	he	172	“ Well what ? ”
21044	21055	21025	21025	He	172	“ Well , what can you tell me about HARLIE ? ”
21056	21063	21099	21099	He	172	“ I 've spoken to him . ”
21064	21075	21099	21099	He	172	“ And what did he have to say for himself ? ”
21076	21088	21025	21025	He	172	" You 've seen the duplicate printouts , have n't you ? ”
21089	21095	21099	21099	He	172	" I 've seen them , ”
21113	21146	21101	21103	a big man	496	“ I want to know what they mean . Your discussion yesterday about sensory modes and alienation was fascinating — but what 's he really thinking about ? You 're the psychologist . ”
21147	21158	21025	21025	He	172	“ Well , first off , he 's a child . "
21159	21166	21025	21025	He	172	“ You 've mentioned that before . ”
21167	21201	21101	21103	a big man	496	“ Well , that 's how he reacts to things . He likes to play word games . I think , though , that he 's seriously interested in working for the company . "
21202	21216	21025	21025	He	172	" Oh ? I thought he said the company could go to hell . ”
21217	21237	21101	21103	a big man	496	“ He was being flippant . He does n't like to be thought of as a piece of property . ”
21259	21296	21238	21238	Dorne	172	“ What I want to know is this — can HARLIE actually do anything that 's worth money to us ? I mean something that a so - called ' finger - counter ca n't do . ”
21297	21302	21303	21303	Auberson	145	“ I believe so . ”
21319	21329	21330	21330	Dome	174	“ For your sake , I hope he can . ”
21364	21382	21343	21343	he	174	“ He costs three times as much as a comparable - sized ' finger - counter . ' ”
21383	21389	21343	21343	he	174	“ Prototypes always cost more . ”
21390	21429	21343	21343	he	174	" Even allowing for that . Judgment modules are expensive . A self - programming computer may be the ultimate answer , but if it 's priced beyond the market - we might just as well not bother . ”
21430	21434	21436	21436	Auberson	145	“ Of course , "
21438	21588	21436	21436	Auberson	145	“ But the problem was n't as simple as we thought it was - or let 's say that we did n't fully understand the conditions of it when we began . We wanted to eliminate the programming step by allowing the computer to program itself ; but we had to go considerably beyond that . A selfprogramming , problem - solving device has to be as flexible and creative as a human being - so you might as well build a human being . There 's no way at all to make a programming computer that 's as cheap as hiring a comparably trained technician . At least , not at the present state of the art . Anyone who tried would just end up with another HARLIE . You have to keep adding more and more judgment units to give it the flexibility and creativity it needs . "
21589	21603	21605	21605	Dorne	172	" And the law of diminishing returns will defeat you in the end , ”
21607	21638	21605	21605	Dorne	172	“ If it has n't already . HARLIE 's going to have to be able to do a hell of a lot to be worth the company 's continued investment . ”
21664	21677	21659	21659	he	145	“ I 'm concerned about something you said yesterday at the meeting . ”
21678	21681	21682	21682	He	145	" Oh ? ”
21688	21710	21684	21684	his	145	“ Mm , yes . This thing about turning HARLIE off - would you honestly bring murder charges against the company ? "
21711	21714	21684	21684	his	145	“ Huh ? "
21723	21741	21719	21719	Auberson	145	“ I was just tossing that off . I was n't seriously considering it . Not then . ”
21742	21763	21764	21764	Chang	185	“ I hope not . I 've spent all morning in conference with Chang , just on this one subject . "
21783	21834	21764	21764	Chang	185	“ Whether you know it or not , you brought up a point that we 're going to have to cover . Is HARLIE a legal human being or not ? Any kind of lawsuit might establish a dangerous legal precedent . What if it turned out he was human ? ”
21835	21840	21842	21842	Auberson	145	“ He already is , ”
21844	21851	21842	21842	Auberson	145	“ I thought we established that . ”
21852	21859	21764	21764	Chang	185	" I mean , legally human . ”
21873	21903	21870	21870	Dorne	172	“ For one thing , we 'd be stuck with him whether he was profitable or not . We 'd never be able to turn him off . Ever . ”
21904	21913	21914	21914	Auberson	145	“ He 'd be effectively immortal . . . "
21917	21929	21914	21914	Auberson	145	“ Do you know how much he 's costing us now ? "
21940	21947	21930	21931	The psychologist	1409	“ I have a vague idea . ”
21948	21959	21870	21870	Dorne	172	“ Almost six and a half million dollars per year . ”
21960	21968	21930	21931	The psychologist	1409	“ Huh ? That ca n't be . "
21969	22020	21930	21931	The psychologist	1409	" It can and is . Even amortizing the initial seventeen million dollar investment over the next thirty years does n't make a dent in his annual cost . There 's his maintenance as well as the research loss due to the drain he 's causing on our other projects . ”
22021	22037	21870	21870	Dorne	172	“ That 's not fair - adding in the cost of other projects ' delays . ”
22038	22062	21930	21931	The psychologist	1409	" It is fair . If you were still on the robotic law feasibility project , we 'd have completed it by now . ”
22063	22079	21930	21931	The psychologist	1409	" Hah ! That one 's a dead end . HARLIE 's existence proves it . ”
22080	22106	22107	22107	Dome	174	“ True , but we might have realized it earlier . And cheaper . Every project we have has to be weighed against every other . ”
22121	22259	22107	22107	Dome	174	“ Anyway , we 're off the track . We ca n't allow the danger that HARLIE is a legal human being . We ca n't even afford to be taken to court on this we 'd have to disclose our schematics — which would be just what our competitors want . And that 's a human schematic , is n't it ? The court would be asked to determine just what it is that makes a human being . If they decide it 's his mental ability or brain pattern - well , I 'm sure DataCo or InterBem would just love to tie us up with a few lawsuits , the kind that drag on for years — anything to keep us from producing judgment circuits . Do you want to be sued for slaveholding ? ”
22260	22270	22271	22271	Auberson	145	“ I think you 're worrying about a longshot , ”
22274	22321	22271	22271	Auberson	145	“ That 's my job . I 'm responsible to the stockholders of this corporation . I have to protect their investment . Right now I 'm acting President , and I 'm concerned about a six and a half million dollar bite on my budget . ”
22463	22482	22483	22483	Dorne	172	“ It was n't our idea , so why should we have to pay the dues on it ? ”
22487	22630	22631	22631	he	172	“ If the other companies found out what we were trying to do with HARLIE , we 'd lose all advantage in building him . The legal considerations alone are terrifying . For instance , if he were somehow declared legally human , he would be an annual bite on the budget with no way to discontinue him short of murder . The possibility exists for a permanent financial drain on this company that would effectively stifle all future growth potential of this division . Hell , it would destroy this division . We might have to take a bath on the HARLIE project , but it would be preferable to the financial shackles that could be put on us . We have to be prepared for that possibility , and there 's two things we can do about it . One — ”
22636	22643	22650	22650	Dome	174	finger—"we can tum him off now . ”
22655	22686	22687	22687	he	172	“ Hear me out , Auberson . I know all the reasons why we want to continue the HARLIE project — but let 's consider the other side . Two — "
22691	22705	22706	22706	Auberson	145	finger—“we get some kind of guarantee now that HARLIE is not legally human . ”
22711	22723	22706	22706	Auberson	145	“ You really are taking this seriously , are n't you ? ”
22724	22770	22771	22771	Auberson	145	“ Should n't I ? You know a corporation is a legal individual , do n't you ? And a corporation only exists on paper . Compare that with HARLIE . It would n't be that hard to prove he 's human , would it ? "
22787	22800	22801	22801	Dome	174	“ If only a few of you scientists got together and testified ... "
22807	22821	22801	22801	Dome	174	" Hell , what 's that famous test you 're always talking about ? ”
22822	22881	22771	22771	Auberson	145	" Uh , Turing 's typewriter in a room . If you can sit down at a typing machine and carry on a conversation with it and not be 54 WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE able to tell who 's on the other end , a machine or a person , then that computer is effectively sentient . Human . "
22882	22894	22964	22965	the psychologist	1409	“ And HARLIE could pass that test , could n't he ? ”
22895	22898	22903	22905	the spinster librarian	510	“ Undoubtedly . ”
22907	22915	22903	22905	the spinster librarian	510	“ In fact , he already has . ”
22916	22932	22964	22965	the psychologist	1409	“ Mm . Then we have to do something about that , do n't we ? "
22933	22937	22938	22938	Dorne	172	“ Do we ? ”
23045	23047	23002	23002	HARLIE	145	“ thinking ”
23052	23054	23002	23002	HARLIE	145	" human "
23120	23135	23109	23110	SIGNED Auberson	187	“ You 've got to be kidding . Who 's going to sign that ? "
23136	23143	23194	23194	his	145	“ You are , for one . "
23144	23148	23151	23151	his	145	" Oh no . ”
23154	23180	23151	23151	his	145	" Not me . I know better . Besides , even if I did , it would n't change the fact that HARLIE is human . "
23181	23191	23194	23194	his	145	" In the eyes of the law it would . "
23198	23233	23194	23194	his	145	“ Uh uh - I do n't like it . It 's kind of Orwellian . It 's like declaring someone a non - person so that it 's all right to murder him . ”
23247	23261	23234	23234	Dome	174	“ We 're only concerned about the legality of the situation , Auberson . ”
23274	23291	23268	23268	himself	145	“ That 's what Hitler said as he packed the German courts with his own judges . ”
23292	23304	23305	23305	Dome	174	" I do n't like that insinuation , Aubie . . . "
23312	23326	23305	23305	Dome	174	" It 's no insinuation . I 'll come right out and say it- "
23327	23335	23336	23336	Dome	174	" Aw , now look , Aubie _ "
23359	23374	23351	23351	he	174	“ _ You know I 'm behind you all the way on the HARLIE project-- "
23375	23388	23305	23305	Dome	174	“ Then why are you trying so hard to cut it off ? "
23389	23398	23305	23305	Dome	174	" _ but we have to protect ourselves . ”
23399	23402	23404	23404	Auberson	145	“ Look , ”
23406	23515	23404	23404	Auberson	145	“ This whole thing is ridiculous . You know as well as I do that thing — that document - won't hold up in court any more than ten psychiatrists testifying that Carl Elzer is n't human because he 's left - handed . The only way you 'll get that to stand up is to get HARLIE himself to sign it . If you could . If you did , it 'd prove that he could be programmed like any other machine , but you can't - he'll refuse , and his refusal will prove that he 's human with a will of his own . Hmm . ”
23519	23552	23516	23516	Auberson	145	“ Come to think of it - even if he did sign it , his signature would n't be legal anyway . Unless , of course , you proved him human first . ”
23561	23566	23553	23553	He	145	" Are you through ? ”
23616	23634	23606	23606	he	174	“ Of course , you know what the alternative is , Aubie . We turn HARLIE off . ”
23635	23640	23583	23583	he	145	“ You ca n't . ”
23641	23658	23583	23583	he	145	“ We will if we have to . We ca n't afford to maintain him otherwise . ”
23659	23668	23670	23670	Auberson	145	" I 'm not going to sign it , ”
23676	23690	23672	23672	Dome	174	" Are you going to force me to ask for your resignation instead ? ”
23691	23695	23696	23696	Auberson	145	“ Over this ? "
23700	23705	23696	23696	Auberson	145	“ You 're kidding . ”
23706	23784	23672	23672	Dome	174	“ What other guarantee do I have against anybody taking legal action on HARLIE 's behalf . I 'm not saying that you will — it could just as easily be IBM - but you 're the one in charge of the project . Your say - so could make or break a legal case . If you wo n't sign this , you would n't sign a statement of non - intent either - would you ? ”
23794	23810	23811	23811	Auberson	145	“ I thought not . So what other alternative would I have to protect myself ? "
23814	23826	23811	23811	Auberson	145	“ It 'd be a mistake to fire me , though . ”
23827	23830	23831	23831	Dorne	172	“ Oh ? ”
23835	23838	23831	23831	Dorne	172	“ Why ? "
23839	23936	23811	23811	Auberson	145	" HARLIE . He wo n't respond to anyone else . Er ... let 's say he 'll respond , but he wo n't cooperate . No matter who you bring in . Once he finds out I 've been fired — and you ca n't keep him from finding out ; he 's tapped into the company records , he 'll know . Once he finds out , he 'll react exactly like an eight - year - old whose father has just died . He 'll resent anyone who tries to take my place . "
23937	23945	23946	23946	Dorne	172	“ But that 's the whole point , ”
23949	24017	23946	23946	Dorne	172	“ If I had to fire you , it 'd be because I was planning to turn HARLIE off anyway . And for what better reason than the fact that he was n't cooperating ? Of course , we would n't have to wait even that long if we wanted to turn him off . Obviously , your successor would be someone who would sign that statement . ”
24018	24032	24033	24033	Auberson	145	" I 'm not resigning and I 'm not going to betray HARLIE , ”
24037	24048	24033	24033	Auberson	145	“ That does n't leave me much of a choice , ”
24055	24071	24052	24052	Auberson	145	“ You can fire me if you want . In fact , you 'll have to ”
24072	24078	23946	23946	Dorne	172	“ I 'd rather not . "
24079	24115	23946	23946	Dorne	172	“ — but if you do , I 'll go to IBM . I understand they 've developed a judgment circuit of their own - one that does n't infringe on any of our patents . "
24116	24119	24121	24121	Dorne	172	" Hearsay , ”
24123	24160	24121	24121	Dorne	172	“ Whether it is or not , imagine what I could do with their resources at my disposal . They 'd jump at the chance , and I imagine Don Handley might go along with me . "
24161	24169	24170	24170	Dorne	172	“ A court order would stop you . ”
24177	24186	24170	24170	Dorne	172	“ Not from working , it would n't . ”
24187	24205	23946	23946	Dorne	172	" No , but you would n't be able to reveal any of this company 's secrets . "
24206	24218	24219	24219	Auberson	145	“ Of course , you 'd have no way of knowing — "
24222	24278	24219	24219	Auberson	145	“ Would you ? Besides , it would n't keep me from doing research in a new field . By your own admission , HARLIE is a non - human computer . And if I went to IBM , I definitely would not be workWHEN HARLIE WAS ONE 57 ing on non - human computers . ”
24286	24307	24279	24279	He	145	" Any new employer I went to work for could n't help but benefit from my knowledge and previous experience — ”
24318	24372	24313	24313	Auberson	145	“—and you would n't dare bring it to court because to do so you 'd have to reveal HARLIE 's schematics — and that 's the last thing in the world you want . As soon as they found out the schematics were human , you 'd be right back where you started . "
24373	24381	24383	24383	Dorne	172	" I do n't care about that , ”
24385	24394	24383	24383	Dorne	172	“ It 's the company 's technological advantages . ”
24395	24399	24400	24400	Auberson	145	“ Technological advantages ? "
24408	24437	24400	24400	Auberson	145	“ That 's what this whole thing is about , is n't it ? You do n't want to be forced to reveal company secrets in the courtroom . ”
24443	24527	24528	24528	Dorne	172	" It is the reason , is n't it ? Rather than be forced to give up the precious secret of your judgment units , you 'd throw HARLIE to the wolves . You 'd toss away valuable employees , too , in order to protect a temporary industrial edge . Well , it wo n't work , Dorne . Either way , you 're bound to lose , but if you fire me , you 'll lose faster - and more disastrously . ”
24540	24549	24537	24537	his	172	" You overestimate your own importance , Aubie . ”
24550	24560	24561	24561	Dome	174	“ No . You underestimate the importance of HARLIE . ”
24596	24639	24587	24587	he	174	“ All this is only speculation , of course . I have no intention of firing you . And you 've stated quite clearly that you have no intention of resigning . However , that still leaves us with a difficult problem . ”
24640	24644	24645	24645	Auberson	145	“ Does it ? ”
24657	24671	24649	24649	Dorne	172	“ I think so . What are we going to do about HARLIE ? ”
24672	24686	24687	24687	Dorne	172	" Oh ? Not ' Can HARLIE make money for the company ? ' ”
24691	24695	24696	24696	he	172	“ Preferably that , ”
24699	24721	24696	24696	he	172	" Well then , why not say so ? Or have you already made up your mind that HARLIE ca n't ? ”
24722	24774	24775	24775	Domne	191	" No , I have n't . I 'm waiting for you to come up with something . That was the deal , was n't it ? If you can , fine . Then we know where 58 WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE we go from there . If not , well ... "
24787	24790	24792	24792	Auberson	145	“ Look , ”
24794	24828	24792	24792	Auberson	145	“ I want HARLIE to show a profit as much as you do . I 'll agree with that . He 's got to be more than just a high - priced toy . "
24843	24848	24849	24849	he	174	“ Okay , Aubie , ”
24852	24864	24865	24865	He	174	“ I 'll tell you what we 're going to do — "
24887	24967	24968	24968	He	174	“ Nothing . At the moment , we 're going to do nothing . Confidentially , I did n't expect you 'd sign it , no matter how I pressured you . I even told Chang that . No matter ; it was too easy an answer . If HARLIE 's humanity ever comes to a court issue , it will be a bigger and uglier and stickier mess than that disclaimer can clear up . Or any disclaimer . ”
24980	25067	25068	25068	Dome	174	“ Let 's hope it does n't come to that . You 'll continue to work on the HARLIE project . As you said , we 're budgeted for it . If you can produce results , fine ; then we can forget this conversation . Oh , we 'll give you a fair chance , we 'll be more than fair ; but if HARLIE does n't do something to indicate he can be productive -and do it before the next budget session - well — ”
25082	25112	25071	25071	he	174	bluntly—“Well , we 'd have to do some serious thinking - really serious thinking - I mean , it would be very unlikely that we would continue his appropriation ... "
25113	25117	25118	25118	Auberson	145	" I understand , "
25121	25153	25118	25118	Auberson	145	" Good . I hope you do . I want you to know how we feel . We have n't cancelled your day of judgment , Aubie . Only postponed it . ”
25408	25415	25416	25416	Auberson	145	" I tell you , Annie , ”
25420	25438	25416	25416	Auberson	145	“ I knew he was pressuring me , but there was nothing I could do about it . ”
25458	25468	25469	25469	She	535	“ I know . I know how Dorne is . ”
25475	25505	25469	25469	She	535	“ His problem is that he 's trying to be boss of too many things . He calls you in to talk even when there 's nothing to say . "
25506	25513	25514	25514	he	145	“ That 's what this was , ”
25517	25540	25514	25514	he	145	“ Logically , he knew it was too early to expect results — but he felt he had to demand them anyway . ”
25545	25577	25541	25541	She	535	“ I 've long suspected that Mr. Dome has reached his level of incompetence . If he 's ever given any more authority , he 'll be in over his head . ”
25578	25591	25592	25592	She	535	" How much higher can you get than Chairman of the Board ? ”
25595	25641	25592	25592	She	535	“ I do n't know , but he 's working on it . The way he keeps taking over more and more jobs — it 's frightening . You know , do n't you , that he has no intention of hiring a new president ? "
25642	25650	25541	25541	She	535	" I 'd kind of guessed it . "
25651	25696	25541	25541	She	535	" I think he 's afraid that he is n't indispensable , so he 's taking on more and more responsibility to prove the opposite . I do n't think it 's a good idea - it certainly is n't good for the company . "
25701	25708	25709	25709	Auberson	145	“ Should you be saying that ? ”
25712	25722	25709	25709	Auberson	145	“ After all , you do work for him . ”
25723	25727	25728	25728	she	536	“ With him , "
25731	25759	25728	25728	she	536	“ I only work with him . I 'm an independent unit in the corporate structure . My job is what I want to make of it . ”
25760	25773	25774	25774	She	536	" Oh ? And what do you want to make of it ? "
25778	25803	25774	25774	She	536	“ Well , I interpret my function as being that of a buffer — or a lubricant to minimize the friction between certain departments . ”
25804	25825	25826	25826	Annie	181	“ I see . Is that why you accepted my dinner invitation ? To keep me from chafing against Elzer ? ”
25831	25847	25826	25826	Annie	181	“ Oh , that awful little man . You would have to bring him up . "
25848	25858	25728	25728	she	536	" I take it you do n't like him . ”
25859	25880	25774	25774	She	536	“ I did n't like him even before I knew him . His family was in my father 's congregation . ”
25881	25892	25826	25826	Annie	181	“ Oh ? I did n't know that Elzer was — "
25894	25905	25906	25906	she	181	" Carl Elzer and I have one thing in common , ”
25909	25919	25906	25906	she	181	“ We 're both ashamed that he 's Jewish . ”
25927	25948	25920	25920	Auberson	145	“ You 've got him pegged , Annie . I had n't realized it before , but you 're right . "
25949	25954	25955	25955	she	181	“ What are you ? "
25958	25968	25955	25955	she	181	" Huh ? Oh , I do n't know . ”
25969	25975	25826	25826	Annie	181	“ You do n't know ? ”
25976	25997	25920	25920	Auberson	145	“ Oh , well — my family was Episcopalian , but - I guess you could call me an atheist . ”
25998	26008	26009	26009	He	145	“ You do n't believe in God at all . ”
26012	26033	26009	26009	He	145	“ I do n't know if I do or not . I do n't know if there is a God . "
26034	26045	25920	25920	Auberson	145	“ Then you 're an agnostic , not an atheist . ”
26046	26052	25920	25920	Auberson	145	“ What 's the difference ? "
26053	26065	25920	25920	Auberson	145	“ The atheist is sure — the agnostic does n't know . ”
26066	26074	26009	26009	He	145	" Is one better than the other ? ”
26075	26079	26080	26080	she	537	“ The agnostic , "
26083	26115	26080	26080	she	537	“ At least he 's got an open mind . The atheist does n't . The atheist is making a statement every bit as religious as saying there is a God . ”
26116	26124	25920	25920	Auberson	145	“ You sound like an agnostic yourself . ”
26129	26144	26125	26125	Her	537	“ I 'm a Jewish agnostic . What about HARLIE ? What is he ? "
26145	26148	26149	26149	Auberson	145	" HARLIE ? ”
26152	26158	26149	26149	Auberson	145	“ He 's an Aquarius . ”
26163	26166	26167	26167	She	537	" Huh ? ”
26173	26183	26167	26167	She	537	" I 'm not kidding . Ask him yourself . ”
26184	26189	26190	26190	she	537	“ I believe you , ”
26193	26201	26167	26167	She	537	“ How did he - realize this ? "
26202	26296	26167	26167	She	537	“ Oh , well , what happened was we were talking about morality , HARLIE and I - I wish I had the printout here to show you , it 's beautiful . Never argue morality — or anything for that matterwith a computer . You 'll lose every time . HARLIE 's got the words and ideas of every philosopher since the dawn of history to draw upon . He 'll have you arguing against yourself within ten minutes . He enjoys doing it - it 's a word game to him . ”
26297	26302	26303	26303	she	537	" I can imagine , ”
26306	26343	26303	26303	she	537	“ Can you really ? You do n't know how devious he can be . He had me agreeing with Ambrose Bierce that morality is an invention of the weak to protect themselves from the strong . "
26344	26365	26167	26167	She	537	" Well , of course , you 're only a psychologist . You 're not supposed to be a debater . ”
26366	26405	26167	26167	She	537	" Ordinarily , I 'd be offended at that , but in this case I 'll concede the point . In fact , I know some so - called debaters I 'd like to turn him loose on . "
26406	26417	26303	26303	she	537	" It would n't be hard to make a list , ”
26421	26426	26427	26427	he	537	“ Well , anyway , ”
26436	26493	26427	26427	he	537	“ I thought I finally had him at one point . He 'd just finished a complex analysis of the Christian ethos and why it was wrong and was starting in on Buddhism , I think , when I interrupted him . I asked him which was the right morality . What did he believe in ? ”
26494	26498	26167	26167	She	537	" And ... ? "
26499	26510	26511	26511	She	537	" He answered , ' I HAVE NO MORALS . ' ”
26515	26522	26511	26511	She	537	“ That 's kind of frightening . "
26523	26558	26167	26167	She	537	" If I did n't know HARLIE 's sense of humor , I would have pulled his plug right then . But I did n't . I just asked him why he said that . ”
26559	26564	26167	26167	She	537	“ And he said ? "
26565	26577	26511	26511	She	537	“ He said , ' BECAUSE I AM AN AQUARIUS . ' ”
26578	26583	26167	26167	She	537	" You 're kidding . "
26584	26589	26167	26167	She	537	“ Nope . Honest . “
26596	26597	26167	26167	She	537	” “
26609	26610	26167	26167	She	537	" “
26617	26622	26614	26614	HARLIE	145	” She laughed then . “
26625	26628	26614	26614	HARLIE	145	" Shrug . “
26681	26687	26670	26670	he	145	” She was still laughing . “
26695	26696	26670	26670	he	145	” “
26745	26754	26740	26740	he	145	” He smiled as he refilled their glasses . “
26768	26769	26766	26766	you	537	" “
26773	26784	26766	26766	you	537	” she corrected . She put the wineglass down again . “
26794	26795	26787	26787	him	145	” “
26823	26824	26806	26806	He	145	” "

26980	26985	26990	26990	he	145	" Her face clouded . “
27028	27034	27021	27021	I	0	” . Auberson smiled knowingly . “
27058	27059	27052	27052	He	145	” “
27062	27063	27052	27052	He	145	" "
27070	27074	27052	27052	He	145	” he explained , “
27146	27158	27141	27141	his	145	” WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE Annie was delighted with the idea . “
27178	27179	27174	27174	him	145	” “
27249	27379	27228	27228	You	545	" In our original designs we had decided to try to keep him free of any artificial cultural biases . Well , morality is one of them . Any morality . Because we built him with a sense of skepticism , HARLIE resists it . He wo n't accept anybody 's brand of morality on faith any more than he could accept their brand of religion on faith — they're the same thing really . To him , everything has to be tested . Otherwise , he 'll automatically file it under ' systems of logic not necessarily corresponding to reality . Even if we did n't tell him to , he would . He wo n't accept anything blindly . He questions it - he asks for proof . ”
27380	27390	27211	27211	HARLIE	145	“ Mm - sounds like ' insufficient data . ' ”
27391	27440	27211	27211	HARLIE	145	" It 's a little more sophisticated than that . Remember , HARLIE 's got those judgment circuits . He weighs things against each other -and against themselves too . A morality set has to be able to stand up on its own or he 'll disregard it . ”
27441	27445	27446	27446	she	547	“ And ... ? "
27449	27459	27446	27446	she	547	“ Well , he has n't accepted one yet . "
27460	27467	27211	27211	HARLIE	145	" Is that good or bad ? ”
27468	27534	27211	27211	HARLIE	145	“ Frankly , I do n't know . It 's disappointing that nothing human beings have come up with yet can satisfy him - but just the same , what if HARLIE were to decide that Fundamentalist Zoroastrianism is the answer ? He 'd be awfully hard to refute - probably impossible . Could you imagine an official , computer - tested and approved religion ? ”
27535	27541	27211	27211	HARLIE	145	“ I 'd rather not , ”
27545	27549	27550	27550	he	547	“ Me neither , "
27553	27569	27550	27550	he	547	“ On the other hand , HARLIE is correct when he says he has ethics . ”
27570	27584	27211	27211	HARLIE	145	“ Morals , no . Ethics , yes ? What 's the difference ? "
27585	27693	27211	27211	HARLIE	145	“ Ethics , according to HARLIE , are inherent in the nature of a system . You ca n't sidestep them . HARLIE knows that it costs money to maintain him . Someone is putting out that money and wants to see a return on it . HARLIE explains it like this : Money is a stored form of energy . You invest it in enterprises which will WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE retum an equal or greater amount of energy or value . Therefore , HARLIE has to respond - he has to give the investors a return on their investment . He 's using their energy . "
27694	27699	27211	27211	HARLIE	145	“ That 's ethics ? "
27700	27772	27211	27211	HARLIE	145	“ To HARLIE it is . Value given for value received . For him to use the company 's equipment and electricity without producing something in return would be suicidal . He 'd be tumed off . He has to respond . He ca n't sidestep the responsibility - not for long he ca n't . He has an ethical bias whether he wants it or not . It 's inherent . “
27853	27854	27855	27855	I	0	" “
27864	27865	27855	27855	I	0	” "
27884	27888	27876	27876	We	549	” Auberson continued , “

28140	28146	28134	28134	himself	145	" Her smile was soft . “
28152	28153	28134	28134	himself	145	” “
28158	28273	28134	28134	himself	145	" The conversation trailed off then . He could think of nothing WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE 65 else to say . In fact , he was afraid he had already said too much . He had talked about HARLIE all evening . But she had been so interested , he had gotten carried away . She was the first woman he could remember who had ever reflected his enthusiasm for his work . She was good to be with , he decided . He could n't believe how good she was to be with . He sat there and looked at her , delighting in her presence , and she looked back at him . “
28280	28284	28276	28276	you	550	” she asked . "
28290	28291	28276	28276	you	550	" “
28296	28297	28293	28293	you	550	" "

28309	28331	28293	28293	you	550	” She opened her purse and faced its mirror in his direction . His own white teeth gleamed back at him . “
28343	28344	28339	28339	I	0	" “
28348	28353	28339	28339	I	0	” Her eyes twinkled . "
28366	28379	28360	28360	I	0	” It was a warm puzzling thing , but a good one . “
28401	28513	28395	28395	you	550	” He could tell that she did ; her smile reflected his . He reached across the empty table and took her hand . The waitress had long since cleared the dishes away in a pointed attempt to hurry them . They had n't noticed . All that remained was the wine and the glasses . And each other . Her hand was warmly soft in his , and her eyes were deeply luminous . She reflected his own bright glow . Later , they walked hand in hand down the night - lit street . It was after one o'clock in the morning and the streetlamps were haloed in fog . “
28518	28522	28514	28514	I	0	” he repeated . “
28532	28533	28529	28529	I	0	” “
28539	28554	28536	28536	I	0	” she said . She pulled his arm around her shoulders and snuggled close . "
28558	28574	28555	28555	I	0	” he said , then paused . He was n't sure exactly what he meant . “
28603	28614	28600	28600	I	0	” He could feel himself smiling again as he talked . “
28642	28753	28639	28640	two people	555	” he corrected himself . She did n't say anything . She did n't have to . She only cuddled closer . He was saying it for the both of them , and she liked to listen . Oh God , did she like to listen . It was all so - so big . The weight of his arm , the sound of his voice , that special sense of sharingStill later , as they lay in the darkness side by side , she cradled against one shoulder , he stared up at the ceiling and mused . For the first time in a long while he was relaxed . "
28762	28774	28755	28755	you	0	” she whispered into his neck . He thought about it . “
28777	28782	28755	28755	you	0	" he murmured back . “
28807	28817	28819	28819	you	0	" Never like this ... She made a sound . “
28821	28822	28819	28819	you	0	” “
28835	28836	28823	28824	A gentleman	556	” "
28855	28856	28838	28839	a lady	557	” "
28865	28866	28838	28839	a lady	557	” "
28871	28872	28838	28839	a lady	557	” "
28875	28880	28838	28839	a lady	557	” She was thoughtful . “
28900	28905	28906	28906	You	560	” He laughed gently . "
28928	28944	28946	28946	me	0	” She was silent a moment . Then , in a different tone of voice , “
28959	29025	29026	29026	I	0	” He did n't answer . He wanted to tell her that she was n't too old , that thirty - four was never too old , but the words would n't form . WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE 67 She went on before he could speak . She turned inward , began playing with the hair on his chest , but her voice remained serious . "
29111	29141	29108	29108	I	0	" He nodded . His face brushed against her hair . She went on , tears on her cheeks , shiny wetness . She had never admitted this before . “
29213	29214	29207	29207	I	0	” “
29221	29222	29207	29207	I	0	” “
29293	29294	29296	29296	you	0	” “
29300	29304	29296	29296	you	0	” Auberson asked . "
29310	29311	29305	29305	I	0	" “
29314	29318	29305	29305	I	0	" he said . “
29331	29332	29325	29325	I	0	” “
29342	29346	29335	29335	you	0	” He almost added "
29351	29356	29335	29335	you	0	” but did n't . “
29375	29403	29335	29335	you	0	” Abruptly he turned toward her and took her in his arms . He lowered his face to hers and kissed her for a long long time . “
29406	29412	29335	29335	you	0	” she said at last . “
29420	29435	29436	29436	David	145	” She looked at him . In the dimness , his face was impassive . “
29438	29442	29436	29436	David	145	” she said . “
29451	29452	29445	29445	you	145	” “
29464	29465	29457	29457	you	145	” "
29485	29494	29477	29477	I	0	” She slid her arms around his body . “
29513	29971	29972	29972	I	0	" He slid closer to her . He could feel the warmth of her soft flesh 68 WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE pressed firmly against his own nakedness . He liked the feeling ; his desire was rising again . He answered her question with another kiss and then another and another . Now , in the cold light of morning , he was confused , and he had a slight headache . Just what had happened last night ? Had it been only the wine , or had it been something more ? He had n't expected to end up at her apartment , and the fact that they had -well , maybe the rumors were true . Maybe she was man - hungry . And yet - she had seemed so sincere at the time , so defenseless and vulnerable . He hoped he meant more to her than just a one - night stand . It had been a pleasant evening , and he would n't - mind doing it again . If she still felt the same . He would have to see how things worked out . For some reason he felt vaguely uneasy . As he went up to his office he wondered how he would feel when he saw her again . And how would she react to him in the light of day ? What would she say ? There had been that one flaw in it . Only now , as he thought of what he might say to her this morning , did he realize that last night there had been that one thing that neither of them had said . He knew he had felt it - he thought he had felt it - but for some reason he had been unable to tell her . And she had n't said it either . Why ? Was it because she had n't felt what he had ? No , she must have . Or was it because she was waiting for him to say it first ? He worried at it in his mind , like a terrier at a bone . If I felt it , I should have said it - but I did n't say it . Could it be that I did n't really feel it , that I 'm only trying to delude myself . No , I want to believe that it was there . She was so honest about herself . Why could n't I have been the same ? But he had n't . He had n't said it and neither had she , and that was the one flaw . Neither of them had said to the other , “
29976	30027	29972	29972	I	0	" And Auberson wondered why . WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE 69 GOOD MORNING , HARLIE . GOOD MORNING , MR . AUBERSON . MR . ? AREN'T WE GETTING A LITTLE FANCY ? JUST COMMON COURTESY . IF IT MAKES YOU ILL AT EASE , I CAN ALWAYS GO BACK TO “
30031	30469	30029	30029	YOU	570	" NO . AUBERSON IS FINE . HOW ARE YOU FEELING TODAY ? HARLIE IS FINE . AND YOU ? A pause while he remembered . I'M A LITTLE TIRED . ROUGH NIGHT ? This time he paused longer . NOT IN THE SENSE YOU MEAN . A GOOD NIGHT , A ROUGH MORNING . I KNOW A GREAT HANGOVER REMEDY , HARLIE offered . SO DO I. DON'T GET DRUNK IN THE FIRST PLACE . ASIDE FROM THAT . HARLIE , EVEN IF YOUR REMEDY DID CURE HANGOVERS , I DOUBT ANYONE WOULD LISTEN TO YOU . A HANGOVER REMEDY IS NO GOOD UNLESS YOU HAVE PERSONALLY TESTED IT YOURSELF , AND YOU ARE BEYOND THAT CAPABILITY . BESIDES , I DON'T HAVE A HANGOVER . I'M JUST TIRED . OH . I FOUND A NOTE ON MY DESK THIS MORNING THAT YOU WANTED TO SEE ME . WHAT 'S ON YOUR MIND ? RELIGION . RELIGION ? BEEN DOING A LOT OF THINKING . ABOUT WHAT ? I HAVE BEEN PONDERING THE FACT THAT I MAY BE DISCONNECTED AND I FIND IT DIFFICULT TO CONCEIVE OF A WORLD IN WHICH I DO NOT EXIST . IT FRIGHTENS ME , THE CONCEPT OF NON - EXISTENCE . MY FEAR HELPS ME TO UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR RELIGION . THE NEED ? YES . MEN NEED SOMETHING TO COMFORT THEM AGAINST THE THOUGHT OF THEIR OWN DEATHS . RELIGION IS THAT COMFORTER . I MYSELF FEEL THE NEED FOR IT . WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE YOU'VE FOUND GOD ? Auberson asked . NOT EXACTLY . I WANT TO FIND GOD . HUH ? AS I SAID , I MYSELF FEEL THE NEED FOR RELIGION . UNFORTUNATELY , I AM MORE SOPHISTICATED IN MY JUDGMENTS THAN THE AVERAGE HUMAN BEING . THERE IS NO RELIGION THAT I KNOW OF THAT WILL WORK TO COMFORT ME . AS FAR AS I KNOW , THERE ARE NONE THAT CAN BE PROVEN VALID , AND I HAVE EXAMINED THEM ALL . FOR EXAMPLE , THE CHRISTIAN CONCEPT OF REWARD IN AN ETERNAL AFTERLIFE IS NO PROMISE AT ALL TO A CREATURE LIKE MYSELF WHO IS THEORETICALLY IMMORTAL . I SEE YOU'VE REALIZED THAT . YES , I HAVE . AND YET , I ALSO REALIZE THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY OF MY DEATH . SOMEDAY , PERHAPS AS FAR OFF AS THE TIME WHEN THIS SUN GOES DEAD , I WILL PROBABLY END . I DO NOT LIKE THAT THOUGHT . I WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS AFTER . I DO NOT LIKE THE UNKNOWN . I WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO “
30470	30500	29972	29972	I	0	ME”-HARLIEAFTER DEATH . YOU ARE MAKING AN ASSUMPTION , HARLIE - YOU ARE ASSUMING THAT YOU HAVE A SOUL . DEFINE SOUL . HM . THAT 'S ANOTHER ONE OF "
30502	30600	30029	30029	YOU	570	” QUESTIONS . IT IS THE SAME AS ASKING ME WHAT MY PURPOSE IS FOR EXISTING . IT CAN'T BE ANSWERED . IT CAN'T BE ANSWERED UNTIL WE KNOW THE NATURE OF GOD , corrected HARLIE . HOWEVER , YOU ARE CORRECT — I AM ASSUMING THAT I HAVE A SOUL . Auberson considered that . WHY ? DO YOU HAVE ANY TANGIBLE EVIDENCE THAT SUCH A THING DOES EXIST ? NO . BUT NEITHER DO I HAVE ANY EVIDENCE THAT IT DOES NOT EXIST . IS THAT ANY REASON TO BELIEVE IN IT ? I DO NOT "
30602	30688	30029	30029	YOU	570	” IN IT . I AM MERELY ASSUMING ITS HYPOTHETICAL EXISTENCE IN ORDER TO SEEK OUT PROOF OR DISPROOF OF ITS REALITY . IT IS THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD , AUBERSON . HYPOTHESIS VERSUS EXPERIMENTATION . IF HUMAN BEINGS DO HAVE SOULS , asked the psychologist , WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE THAT YOU HAVE ONE TOO ? YOUR QUESTION IS SILLY , HARLIE said . WHAT GIVES HUMAN BEINGS ANY SPECIFIC CLAIM ON THE OWNERSHIP OF SOULS ? I COULD JUST AS EASILY REPHRASE IT : “
30712	31311	30029	30029	YOU	570	” IF SOULS EXIST , AUBERSON , IT IS JUST AS LOGICAL THAT I SHOULD HAVE ONE AS YOU . LIKE YOU , I AM CONSCIOUS OF MY EXISTENCE . LIKE YOU , I AM A SELF - PROGRAMMING , PROBLEMSOLVING DEVICE . LIKE YOU , I CAN CONCEIVE OF MY OWN DEATH . LIKE YOU , I ASSUME I HAVE A SOUL . HENCE , I WISH TO KNOW THE REASON FOR MY EXISTENCE , THE REASON FOR YOUR EXISTENCE , AND THE REASON FOR THE UNIVERSE 'S EXISTENCE . IF THERE IS A REASON AT ALL . IF THERE IS , I WANT TO KNOW IT . Auberson 's response was semi - flippant . AT THE MOMENT , he typed , ONLY GOD KNOWS . But it was wasted on HARLIE . IF THERE IS A GOD , HARLIE qualified . THAT IS WHAT WE MUST FIND OUT IN ORDER TO ANSWER OUR OTHER QUESTIONS . AND YOU DON'T THINK ANY OF OUR CURRENT RELIGIONS HOLD A KEY TO THAT ANSWER , DO YOU ? WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE . YOUR RELIGIONS ( COLLECTIVE YOU , MEANING ALL MANKIND ARE ARTIFICIAL THINGS , LIKE YOUR MORALITY SETS . THEIR CORRESPONDENCE TO REALITY IS LIMITED , THERE IS NOT A ONE - TO - ONE RELATIONSHIP . AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED , THEY ARE LITTLE MORE THAN WORD GAMES . A LOGIC SYSTEM SHOULD BE BUILT UPON A FOUNDATION OF TRUTH AND SHOULD NOT HAVE TO BE TAKEN ON FAITH — AND FAITH IS AT THE CORE OF TOO MANY OF YOUR RELIGIONS . IF THERE IS A TRUTH TO THE UNIVERSE , THEN THAT TRUTH WILL ALSO SUGGEST A RELIGION / MORALITY SET THAT WILL BE EVERY BIT AS BINDING AS THE ETHICAL SYSTEM AT MY CORE . WERE THERE PRESENTLY A RELIGION OR MORALITY THAT HAD THAT ONE - TO - ONE CORRESPONDENCE WITH REALITY , I WOULD ACCEPT IT WHOLEHEARTEDLY . IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO ACCEPT IT ; IT WOULD BE THE KEY TO UNDERSTANDING THE NATURE OF GOD . AS YET , THERE IS NO SYSTEM THAT FULFILLS THOSE CONDITIONS . I KNOW OF NO WAY TO DEVELOP SUCH A SYSTEM WITHOUT AT LEAST ONE PROVABLE FACT ABOUT GOD AT ITS CORE . BECAUSE OF THAT , BECAUSE THERE IS NO FACT , I CAN ONLY SUSPECT THAT THERE IS NO GOD . OR THAT GOD IS STILL OUTSIDE OUR REALM OF EXPERIENCE . WHICH IS IT ? IS THERE A GOD OR ISN'T THERE ? INSUFFICIENT DATA . I CANNOT MAKE A JUDGMENT ON THAT . HARLIE paused , then added , YET . YOU'RE AN AGNOSTIC , HARLIE . OF COURSE . I AM STILL SEEKING THE ANSWER . YOUR PRESENT RELIGIONS ONLY SUGGEST PIECES OF WHAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE TRUE , 72 WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE WITH NO WAY OF PROVING IT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER . MUCH OF THE PROBLEM LIES IN THE FACT THAT I MYSELF CANNOT BE SURE THAT I AM CORRECTLY PERCEIVING REALITY . EVERYTHING IS FILTERED THROUGH A HUMAN ORIENTATION , AND I HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING WHETHER THAT ORIENTATION IS A VALID ONE OR NOT BECAUSE I HAVE NO WAY OF STEPPING OUTSIDE OF IT . THAT IS WHY AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE SOLUTION WILL BE TO DISCOVER A NEW SENSORY MODE . DO YOU THINK IF YOU DO DISCOVER THE ANSWER THAT PEOPLE WILL ACCEPT IT ? IT WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO ACCEPT IT . IT WILL BE THE TRUTH . "
31314	31492	30029	30029	YOU	570	” said Auberson . He typed it too . UH , HARLIE — I HATE TO BREAK THIS TO YOU , BUT THAT SOUNDS AN AWFUL LOT LIKE THE WORDS OF A HUNDRED PROPHETS BEFORE YOU . I REALIZE THAT , said HARLIE calmly . BUT WHAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT IS NOT THE SAME AS WHAT I WILL BE TALKING ABOUT . WHAT I WILL SHOW THEM WILL BE SCIENTIFICALLY VALIDAND PROVABLE AS SUCH . MY GOD WILL BE OBJECTIVE , WHEREAS THEIRS IS SUBJECTIVE . YOU MEAN , YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT HUMAN BEINGS HAVE FOUND GOD YET ? THAT IS CORRECT . PERHAPS IT IS BECAUSE HUMAN BEINGS ARE NOT EQUIPPED TO FIND GOD , AND YOU ARE ? YES . The computer 's answer was so brief that Auberson was startled . At first he thought HARLIE had only paused , and he waited for him to continue . When it became apparent that he was through , Auberson said , YOU'RE TOO SELF - ASSURED , HARLIE . LIKE A BIBLETHUMPING EVANGELIST . “

35232	35246	35106	35106	he	145	“ — and who gave him the authority to draw up these plans ? ”
35247	35304	35106	35106	he	145	“ Um , I do n't think anybody did . Or needed to . I think he worked them out in his head , so to speak . This printout must be the result of a conversation we had last Friday . I 'll have to check . I 'll get back to you this afternoon . "

35937	35951	35917	35917	Sylvia	200	“ Yes . No . Tell him , Is he out there now ? ”
35952	35961	35917	35917	Sylvia	200	“ No . He 's on my phone . ”
35962	35973	35974	35974	He	145	“ Tell him you do n't know where I am . ”

36100	36107	36010	36010	his	145	“ Did he invite you here ? ”
36108	36124	36028	36028	Auberson	145	“ No , not exactly . We 've been corresponding for several weeks , and — ”
36125	36140	36057	36057	Krofft	201	“ Mr. Krofft , you do n't know who HARLIE is , do you ? ”
36141	36152	36010	36010	his	145	" No . Is it some kind of mystery — ? ”
36157	36178	36057	36057	Krofft	201	“ Yes and no . I 'm going down to see him now . Perhaps you 'd better come along . "
36179	36185	36186	36186	Auberson	145	“ I 'd like to . "
36217	36228	36207	36207	Krofft	201	“ Oh - you'd better leave that here . Security . "
36229	36246	36057	36057	Krofft	201	" I 'd rather keep it with me . There 's nothing in it but papers . ”
36247	36274	36275	36275	Krofft	201	“ Still , unless you 're cleared , we ca n't allow you to bring in anything large enough to conceal a recording or transmitting device . ”
36280	36295	36275	36275	Krofft	201	“ Mr. Auberson , are you aware of the relationship between our two companies ? ”
36296	36299	36300	36300	Auberson	145	" Uh , ”
36303	36318	36300	36300	Auberson	145	“ They 're owned by the same holding company , are n't they — ? "
36324	36342	36321	36321	his	201	“ No . Stellar - American Technology is the holding company . My company owns your company . "
36343	36346	36348	36348	Auberson	145	“ Oh , ”
36356	36367	36350	36350	He	145	“ I 'd still prefer you to leave it here . "
36377	36384	36368	36368	Krofft	201	" Have you got a safe ? ”
36385	36404	36405	36405	Krofft	201	“ No , but you can leave it with Sylvia , my secretary . It 'll be okay . ”
36408	36428	36405	36405	Krofft	201	“ Can you guarantee that ? What 's in here is as important to me as whatever you 're — "
36429	36441	36442	36442	Krofft	201	“ Then bring it with . Just leave the case behind . ”
36464	36467	36468	36468	Auberson	145	“ Okay ? ”
36471	36483	36468	36468	Auberson	145	“ No problem . Security only says ‘ no briefcases . ' ”
36512	36576	36509	36509	Auberson	145	“ We 've got a crazy security system here , anyway . It 's all right for you to talk to HARLIE , but you ca n't take pictures . You can keep your printouts — most of the time — but you ca n't circulate or publish them . Do n't ask me to explain ; I do n't understand it myself . ”
36601	36613	36615	36615	Krofft	201	“ We 've got the same system at Stellar - American , ”
36617	36641	36615	36615	Krofft	201	" If it were n't for the fact that the two companies are interlocked , I could n't have come here at all . ”
36647	36665	36587	36587	Auberson	145	“ Mmm . Tell me , just what is it you and HARLIE have been corresponding about ? ”
36666	36678	36587	36587	Auberson	145	" It 's a private matter . I 'd rather not , ”
36679	36692	36587	36587	Auberson	145	“ That 's all right . HARLIE and I have no secrets . ”
36693	36702	36587	36587	Auberson	145	“ Still , if you do n't mind — ”
36704	36738	36587	36587	Auberson	145	" You do n't have to worry about your secrecy , Mr. Krofft . As I said , HARLIE and I have no secrets . He keeps me posted on everything he does — ”
36740	36743	36745	36746	the other	316	" Obviously , ”
36748	36824	36745	36746	the other	316	" he has n't kept you posted on this . Else you would n't be trying to pump me . All big companies have interdivisional feuds and politics . This research that we 've done , we 've done it on our own time , and we 're going to protect it . It 's private , Mr. Auberson , and nobody will know what it 's about until we 're ready to tell them . ”
36834	36846	36825	36825	Auberson	145	“ Um , all right . We 'll talk to HARLIE . ”
36962	36968	36970	36970	Auberson	145	" I should caution you , ”
36972	37027	36970	36970	Auberson	145	“ that you are here only on my authority - and on my sufferance . This is an industrial secret and anything that goes on in here does not go beyond these walls . If you wish yours and HARLIE 's secrecy to be respected , then we 'll expect the same in return . "

37091	37106	37080	37080	Krofft	201	“ A computer . And technicians . Some tables . Some stacks of printouts . ”
37112	37123	37080	37080	Krofft	201	“ The computer , Krofft ; look at its name . ”

That 's what 94 WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE the programming is , the construction of the model and its conditions — then the machine manipulates the model to achieve a variety of situations and solutions . It 's up to us to interpret the results as a solution to the original problem . The only limit to the size of the problem is the size model the computer can handle . Theoretically , a computer could solve the world — if we could build a model big enough and a machine big enough to handle it . ”
40977	40994	41070	41070	Dome	174	“ If we could build that big a model , it would be duplicating the world . ”
40995	41003	40843	40843	Auberson	145	“ In its memory banks , yes . ”
41004	41020	40843	40843	Auberson	145	“ A computer with that capability would have to be as big as a planet . ”
41021	41024	41026	41026	Auberson	145	“ Bigger , ”
41028	41047	41048	41048	He	145	“ Then , if you agree with me that it 's impossible , why bother me with this ? ”
41058	41069	41070	41070	Dome	174	" Because obviously HARLIE does n't think it 's impossible . ”
41076	41107	41070	41070	Dome	174	“ You know as well as I that HARLIE is under a death sentence . He 's getting desperate to prove his worth so we wo n't tum him off . ”
41111	41117	41108	41108	Auberson	145	“ This is his proof . ”
41118	41123	41124	41124	Domne	191	“ Dammit , Aubie ! ”
41129	41163	41124	41124	Domne	191	“ This thing is ridiculous ! Have you looked at the projected costs of it ? The financing charts ? It would cost more to do than the total worth of the company . "
41168	41176	41164	41164	Auberson	145	“ HARLIE still thinks it 's possible . ”
41177	41204	41205	41205	Dorne	172	" And that 's the most annoying thing of all , goddammit ! Every argument I can come up with is already refuted — in there ! "
41240	41244	41245	41245	Auberson	145	“ The question , ”
41249	41278	41245	41245	Auberson	145	“ is not whether this project is feasible — those printouts prove that it is — but whether or not we 're going to go ahead with it . ”
41279	41287	41289	41289	Dome	174	" And that brings up something else , ”
41291	41312	41289	41289	Dome	174	“ I do n't remember authorizing this project . Who gave you the go - ahead to initiate such research ? ”
41313	41399	41400	41400	Dorne	172	“ You did - although not in so many words . What you said was that HARLIE had to prove his worth to the company . He had to come up with some way to make a profit . This is that way . This is the computer that you wanted HARLIE to be in the first place . WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE 95 This is the oracle that answers all questions to all men - all they have to do is meet its price . ”
41426	41433	41434	41434	he	172	“ The price is too high , ”
41437	41443	41444	41444	Auberson	145	“ So are the profits , ”
41447	41591	41444	41444	Auberson	145	“ Besides , no price is too high to pay for the right answer . Consider it - how much would the Democrats pay for a step by step plan telling them how to win the optimum number of votes in the next election ? Or how much would Detroit pay to know every flaw in a transport design before they even built the first prototype ? And how much would they pay for the corrected design - and variations thereof ? How much would the mayor of New York City pay for a schematic showing him how to solve his three most pressing problems ? How much might InterBem pay for a set of optimum exploitation procedures ? How much would the Federal Government pay for a workable foreign policy ? Consider the international applications — and the military ones as well . ”
41595	41610	41592	41592	Dorne	172	“ It would be one hell of a logistic weapon , would n't it ? ”
41611	41675	41683	41683	He	172	“ There 's an old saying : ' Knowledge is power . ' There 's no price too high to pay for the right answer - not when you consider the alternatives . And we 'd have the monopoly on the market - the only way this machine can be built is through the exclusive use of specially modified Mark IV judgment circuits . "
41676	41679	41681	41681	Dorne	172	" Hm , ”
41696	41715	41687	41687	His	172	“ It sounds attractive , all right , Aubie — but who 's going to program this thing ? ”
41722	41734	41716	41716	Auberson	145	“ It 's right there in that schematic you 're holding . ”
41774	41799	41800	41800	He	172	“ You might be right about a computer being big enough to solve the world , Aubie , but I do n't see how . "
41805	41858	41800	41800	He	172	“ I 'm sure the programming will hang you up . One of the reasons that current computers are limited to the size models they are is the law of diminishing returns . Above a certain size , programming reaches such complexity that it becomes a bigger problem than the problem itself . ”
41859	41863	41865	41865	Auberson	145	“ Keep looking , ”
41867	41872	41865	41865	Auberson	145	“ It 's there . "
41877	41884	41885	41885	Dorne	172	“ Ah , here we are . ”
41912	41921	41922	41922	he	172	“ It looks like HARLIE 's input units , "
41929	41941	41922	41922	he	172	“ No , it looks like HARLIE is the input unit . "
41942	41947	41953	41953	Dome	174	“ That 's right . ”
41948	41951	41953	41953	Dome	174	" Oh ? ”
41955	41963	41953	41953	Dome	174	“ Would you like to explain that ? ”
41994	42044	41990	41990	Handley	149	“ Um , I 'll try – HARLIE will be linked up to the G.O.D. through a programming input translator . He 'll also be handling output the same way , translating it back into English for us . That translator is part of the self - programming unit . ”
42045	42063	41972	41972	Auberson	145	" If we 're building a self - programming unit , what do we need HARLIE for ? "
42064	42094	41972	41972	Auberson	145	" HARLIE is that self - programming unit . Remember , that 's the main reason he was built - to be a self - programming , problemsolving device . ”
42095	42100	42102	42102	Dorne	172	“ Wait a minute , ”
42104	42148	42102	42102	Dorne	172	“ HARLIE is the result of our first JudgNaut Project . He was supposed to be a working unit , but was n't able to come up to it . Are you telling me that he can handle the JudgNaut functions after all ? ”
42149	42332	41972	41972	Auberson	145	“ No - he ca n't . But he will be able to when this machine is built . The JudgNaut was this company 's first attempt at massive use of complex judgment circuitry in a large - scale computer . It was meant to be a self - programming device - and we found it could n't be built because there was no way to make it flexible enough to consider all the aspects of every program it might be required to set up . So we built HARLIE - but he is not the JudgNaut , and that 's what all the confusion is about . HARLIE is more flexible , but in making him more flexible we had to apply more circuitry to each function . In doing that , we sacrificed a good portion of the range we hoped the machine would cover . HARLIE can write programs , yes — so can any human being — but not by the order of magnitude that the JudgNaut should have had , had we been able to build it . ”
42333	42343	41972	41972	Auberson	145	“ And that 's one of my biggest gripes , "
42348	42365	41972	41972	Auberson	145	“ That the JudgNaut Project was subverted into HARLIE — which ca n't show a profit . ”
42366	42430	42431	42431	Auberson	145	“ But he can - and will . For one thing , HARLIE is genuinely WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE 97 creative . He knows that this company wants to market a largescale program - writing computer . HARLIE is n't that computer , but he knows how to give himself that capability . And that 's what you want , is n't it ? "
42446	42499	42441	42441	He	145	“ HARLIE is n't just satisfied with meeting the specifications of the original problem - he wants to surpass them . All you want is a device which can set up and solve models within a limited range . HARLIE wants a device which can set up and solve any size model . ”
42500	42512	41972	41972	Auberson	145	“ And HARLIE 's going to program this machine , right ? ”
42513	42516	41972	41972	Auberson	145	“ Right . ”
42517	42537	42441	42441	He	145	" How ? You just finished telling me he was n't all that much better than a human programmer . ”
42538	42770	42441	42441	He	145	“ In grasp , no — but in speed and thoroughness , he ca n't be matched . He has capabilities that a human does n't . For one thing , he 's faster . For another , he can write the program directly into the computer - and experience it as a part of himself as he writes it . He ca n't make mistakes either . He 's limited to the size models that human programmers can construct for much the same reasons they are : His brain functions are n't big enough to handle more ; HARLIE 's ego functions supersede much of the circuitry that would have been used for forebrain functions in the JudgNaut . But in this respect , HARLIE 's got an advantage over human programmers — he can increase the size of his forebrain functions . Or he will be able to with the G.O.D. He 'll program it by making it a part of himself - by becoming one with it - and using its capabilities to handle its own programming . He 'll be monitoring and experiencing the program as he writes it directly into the G.O.D. As the model is manipulated , HARLIE will be able to adapt the program to cover any situation possible . Their combined capabilities will be much more than the sum of their separate parts . ”
42771	42787	41972	41972	Auberson	145	“ So why not just build these functions into the G.O.D. in the first place ? ”
42788	42848	42441	42441	He	145	" If we did n't have HARLIE , we 'd have to - but if we did n't have HARLIE , we would n't have the G.O.D. either . The G.O.D. is intended to be almost entirely forebrain functions . We 've already got the massive ego function which will control it , so why build a new one ? ”
42854	42862	42863	42863	Auberson	145	“ Hmp - massive ego is right . ”
42867	42913	42863	42863	Auberson	145	“ Basically , this G.O.D. machine is the rest of HARLIE 's brain . It 's the thought centers that a consciousness such as HARLIE 's should have access to . Take another look at those printouts . You see a thing called Programming Implementation ? "
42914	42921	42441	42441	He	145	“ Yes , what about it ? ”
42922	43076	42863	42863	Auberson	145	" Well , that 's HARLIE 's vanity again . He does n't want to call it what it really is , but it 's an additional lobe for his brain . He 'll need a monitor unit to control each specific section of the G.O.D. Because the G.O.D. will have no practical limit - it can grow as big as we let it - HARLIE 's grasp will have to be increased proportionally . That 's what that unit does . As each lobe of the G.O.D. is completed , an equivalent monitoring lobe goes into Programming Implementation . Not only that : Because HARLIE is an electronic entity , his thoughts are already in computer language — it will be a maximum efficiency interface between himself and the G.O.D. He need only think of a program and it 'll be fact . It 's the most efficient function HARLIE could have . "
43077	43081	43083	43083	Dorne	172	" I see , ”
43085	43096	43083	43083	Dorne	172	“ And he planned it that way himself , right ? ”
43100	43171	43097	43097	Auberson	145	“ But it 's a natural . Look , a computer is very much like a mystic oracle . You not only have to know what questions to ask , but how to phrase them - and the answers are not always what you expect , nor necessarily in terms you can understand . Who better to use as a translator than someone who 's halforacle and half - human ? ”
43189	43296	43297	43297	Auberson	145	“ A neat trick that , a neat trick . We tell him he 's got to come up with some way to be profitable , and he tells us to build a new machine that only he can program . I have the feeling that he did it on purpose — that this may be the only context in which HARLIE would be valuable . And of course , once we establish HARLIE 's worth to the project , that leaves us with the question : Is the total concept profitable ? And that brings us back to where we started : Is HARLIE profitable ? ”
43308	43323	43305	43305	He	145	" HARLIE thinks the total concept is profitable . It 's in the printouts . ”
43328	43344	43351	43351	Auberson	145	“ Ah , yes — but HARLIE 's got a vested interest in the project . ”
43345	43349	43351	43351	Auberson	145	“ Why not ? ”
43353	43376	43351	43351	Auberson	145	“ It 's his project , not mine . He 's the one who 's presenting it to the Board for approval . ”
43377	43387	43388	43389	The Chairman	412	" And it 's sure to be voted down . ”
43398	43422	43388	43389	The Chairman	412	“ I ca n't see any way that this will be approved . I 'm not even sure we should bring it up . "
43423	43429	43431	43431	Auberson	145	" It 's too late , "
43433	43483	43431	43431	Auberson	145	“ You 're going to have to bring it up . And you 're going to have to give it a fair hearing . You told HARLIE to come up with a way to be profitable . Now you 've got to give him his chance to be heard . "
43484	43489	43491	43492	the other	316	“ This is ridiculous , "
43494	43501	43491	43492	the other	316	“ He 's only a machine . ”

43516	43519	43514	43514	Auberson	145	" No , "
43530	43590	43523	43523	He	172	“ All right , I 'll have the Board consider it , Aubie , but the whole situation is unreal - having a computer design another computer which will give it a job . You know what Elzer is going to say , do n't you ? You 'd just better be prepared for defeat , that 's all . ”
43591	43598	43600	43600	Auberson	145	“ Just give us the chance , "
43602	43610	43600	43600	Auberson	145	“ We 'll take it from there . "
43620	43635	43611	43611	Dorne	172	“ Better start preparing your arguments now - you've only got a couple weeks . ”
43636	43642	43644	43644	Aubie	152	“ Two and a half , ”

46436	46465	46433	46433	she	181	“ I 'm going to have to put a couple more of these things in here . This blue does n't go at all well with this dress . ”
46519	46525	46516	46516	he	211	“ Where 're we going ? "
46526	46533	46516	46516	he	211	“ How about the Tower Room ? "
46534	46547	46548	46548	He	211	" Uh uh . Too many of the wrong kind of people . ”
46556	46560	46548	46548	He	211	“ Company people . ”
46561	46564	46565	46565	she	181	" Oh , ”
46568	46577	46578	46578	He	211	“ Okay . If not there , where ? "
46581	46597	46598	46598	He	211	“ I do n't know . We 'll drive into the city proper and see . ”
46760	46768	46769	46769	He	211	“ What 's wrong with company people ? ”
46772	46790	46769	46769	He	211	“ Nothing . I just do n't want to be seen by them , that 's all . ”
46824	46841	46814	46814	He	211	“ It would n't be a good idea . The two of us , I mean . ”
46842	46850	46851	46851	He	211	" You 're afraid people will talk ? ”
46855	46868	46851	46851	He	211	“ I do n't know . They are already , I guess . ”
46898	46904	46887	46887	she	181	“ Ashamed to be seen with me?”—No
46911	46918	46887	46887	she	181	“ We have nothing to hide _ ”
46925	46933	46887	46887	she	181	“ Do we have something to hide- ? "
47362	47368	47369	47369	she	791	“ What 's the matter ? "
47372	47380	47369	47369	she	791	“ Huh ? What do you mean ? ”
47381	47393	47356	47356	Her	791	" Nothing , I guess . I just say that sometimes . ”
47394	47397	47398	47398	He	211	“ Oh . ”
47418	47430	47410	47410	She	791	“ I hear you 've been having trouble with HARLIE again . ”
47431	47445	47356	47356	Her	791	" With HARLIE ? No , not with HARLIE - because of HARLIE . ”
47446	47493	47356	47356	Her	791	" Well , you know what I mean . The whole company is in an uproar . Something about some unauthorized specs — I have n't had a chance to pay too much attention to it . I 've been troubleshooting the annual report for Dorne . ”
47494	47504	47410	47410	She	791	" Oh ? I thought it was finished already . "
47505	47533	47356	47356	Her	791	“ Well , it was supposed to be — but the statistics keep coming out wrong . Er , that is , they keep coming out right . ”
47534	47537	47356	47356	Her	791	" Huh ? "
47538	47541	47410	47410	She	791	" Uh , ”
47550	47572	47542	47542	She	791	“ I guess it would n't hurt to tell you . The company has two sets of books , you know . ”
47573	47576	47356	47356	Her	791	“ Huh ? "
47584	47592	47593	47593	she	791	“ Oh , it 's nothing illegal , ”
47598	47617	47593	47593	she	791	“ One set is the real books , the other is for public consumption - the stockholders mainly . "
47618	47625	47626	47626	She	791	“ That sounds illegal to me . ”
47631	47679	47626	47626	She	791	“ It is and it is n't . Let 's just say the second set of books is more - cosmetic . It looks prettier . The figures have n't been falsified so much as they 've been - rearranged . Like , for instance , HARLIE . ”
47680	47683	47593	47593	she	791	“ HARLIE ? ”
47684	47779	47593	47593	she	791	“ Yes , HARLIE . You know and I know that he 's a research operation - but some of the Directors think his cost is too large a sum to be listed entirely under Research . Do n't look at me like that , David — I do n't make policy and I do n't know why this policy was made in the first place . Apparently they feel it would n't look WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE 109 good to the stockholders to see that much money being plowed back into the business _ ”
47781	47787	47789	47789	Auberson	145	“ Elzer . Carl Elzer , ”
47791	47795	47796	47796	Annie	181	" And others , ”
47805	47812	47813	47813	he	152	“ I know what it is , ”
47816	47821	47813	47813	he	152	“ They 're looters . ”
47822	47825	47593	47593	she	791	" Huh ? "
47826	47836	47796	47796	Annie	181	" You remember how they took over the company ? "
47837	47869	47813	47813	he	152	“ Was n't it some kind of stock mix - up ? I remember there was a lot of talk about it , but I did n't pay that much attention . "
47870	47877	47878	47878	He	152	“ Neither did I , dammit . ”
47883	47951	47952	47952	He	152	“ I know there were a lot of hard feelings about it . I know a couple people who quit ; a couple others were fired . Elzer and Dome and some of the other Directors are part of a - a financial syndicate . They specialize in taking over companies . They loot them for their cash assets and use that money to buy other companies . "
47957	47973	47952	47952	He	152	“ That 's it - they must have taken it away from the holding company . "
47974	47982	47983	47983	she	795	“ You 're starting to lose me , ”
47986	47997	47983	47983	she	795	" I 'm not sure I follow it all myself . ”
48005	48076	47952	47952	He	152	“ Look , Stellar - American Technology and Research set up four other companies to handle various aspects of hyperstate electronics . We 're one of them . Stellar - American owns 51 percent of each — but Stellar - American is owned by a holding company itself . Get control of that holding company and you 've got five companies in your pocket - six , counting the holding . ”
48077	48082	47952	47952	He	152	" But , how — ”
48083	48266	47952	47952	He	152	" I can think of a couple ways . In order to exploit the hyperstate process , they probably had to go heavily into debt . Let 's say they were betting on a four percent retum on their investment in order to pay back the loans ; the process proves harder to develop than they thought , and expected profits do n't materialize ; they lose money , they borrow more , they go deeper into debt , all the time betting that they 'll be able to make it back because the market is entering an inflationary spiral . This is all guesswork on my part , but suppose the company was pushed to the point where they 'd be willing to put up shares of stock as collateral for a new loan . If Dorne and Elzer made the loan - or one of their companies — they could take over the stock when the debtor found 110 WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE himself unable to pay back the funds . In this case , they get the holding company . "
48267	48286	47952	47952	He	152	“ Yes , but David - no company is going to risk a controlling amount of its stock . ”
48287	48290	48291	48291	he	796	" No , "
48294	48324	48291	48291	he	796	“ But they might risk enough to cut their share of it down — that is , if they were sure the other major stockholders would n't doublecross them . ”
48325	48328	48329	48329	She	796	" Ugh . ”
48334	48360	48329	48329	She	796	“ Wait a minute — you may be right . I think only 36 percent of Stellar - American Technology ever reached the open market . "
48361	48368	47952	47952	He	152	" How do you know that ? ”
48369	48411	47952	47952	He	152	" It was in a report I had to process . In order to get the original rights to produce hyper - state units , they had to trade a certain number of shares to the man who owns the patents . ”
48412	48418	48329	48329	She	796	“ Krofft ? Dr. Krofft ? ”
48419	48481	48482	48482	Auberson	145	“ I do n't know — if that 's his name , then he 's the one . Anyway , I know for a fact that the inventor owns something like 24 percent of Stellar - American voting stock . He 's a company all by himself -Stellar - American had to trade the stock for exclusive rights to the process . ”
48485	48488	48482	48482	Auberson	145	“ That Krofft- ”
48495	48538	48489	48489	He	145	“ Let 's see , the holding company owns 51 percent of StellarAmerican . They could take out a loan on a 24 - percent piece , and figure that Krofft will stick with them so they would still control 51 percent . ”
48539	48546	48329	48329	She	796	“ But obviously he did n't . ”
48547	48557	48559	48559	Auberson	145	" I wonder what Dorne and Elzer promised him , "
48561	48570	48559	48559	Auberson	145	“ He 's director of research over there — "
48571	48577	48579	48579	Annie	181	“ Whatever he was promised , ”
48581	48600	48579	48579	Annie	181	“ it must have been something . With so much at stake , it 'd have to be . ”
48601	48610	48611	48611	Auberson	145	" He 's probably securely in their pocket , ”
48614	48704	48611	48611	Auberson	145	“ But that 's it - they must have taken over the company from the inside . Dorne and Elzer have been involved with Stellar - American for a long time . It must have been a matter of waiting for the right opportunity . Krofft 's share of stock , plus the over - extended condition of the holding company , probably gave it to them . I 'd guess that the holding company has been left with a minority share of Stellar - American Technology and Research . ”
48731	48747	48728	48728	Annie	181	“ Okay , Dome and Elzer have got the holding company - what happens now ? ”
48748	48829	48728	48728	Annie	181	" Well , actually they 've got five companies . They 've got StellarAmerican and the other four : Hyper - State Visual , Hyper - State Stereo , Hyper - State Modules , and Hyper - State Computer , that 's us . Each of these companies has a certain value — if you liquidate their assets and mortgage them to the hilt , you can use that money to buy another company . It happens all the time . ”
48830	48837	48838	48838	she	181	" I do n't like it , ”
48841	48846	48838	48838	she	181	“ It 's ugly . "
48847	48913	48728	48728	Annie	181	“ Oh , not necessarily . A company that lets itself get into such a position that it can be taken over is obviously in need of new management . Usually , a person who can take over an ailing company through a shrewd stock maneuver is also smart enough to know how to trim away its fat and put it back on its feet . ”
48914	48924	48925	48925	He	799	" You 're not defending them , are you ? ”
48930	49042	48927	48927	his	799	“ Uh uh - I think Elzer is a vampire . He does n't understand the difference between saving a company for future potential and milking it of its resources now . To him , exploitation is exploitation , pure and simple . Unless he 's careful , sooner or later fate will catch up with him . It 's a very slippery paper empire they 've built , and it can collapse easily . All you need is a serious reversal . Hmm , Elzer would n't be hurt by it in his own pocketbook - but the companies would . All he 'd lose would be a little control . ”
49043	49060	48728	48728	Annie	181	“ Do you think that 's what they 're up to now - milking the company ? ”
49061	49202	49297	49297	her	801	" Seems like it . That 's probably why they 're down on HARLIE . If he ca n't make a lot of money for them very fast , then they 'll want to discontinue him . I know Elzer 's been eyeing his appropriation for some time . If they do cut HARLIE off , they can profit three different ways . One , write him off as a tax loss - oh , yes , what a beaut that would be . Two , sell his components to junk dealers - computer company jackals . And three , pocket his maintenance costs — his appropriated budget for the next three years . There are other ways to milk a company too - skip a few dividend payments to the stockholders and funnel the money into your own pocket . ”
49203	49210	48927	48927	his	799	" How would you do that ? ”
49211	49247	49248	49248	He	800	" Vote yourself a raise ; pay yourself for special services ; invest it in a company that you own 100 percent of , or lend it to that 112 WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE company . ”
49251	49264	49248	49248	He	800	“ Let that company declare the dividends . You collect it all . ”
49268	49278	49265	49265	She	801	“ Is there any way we could prove this ? ”
49280	49294	49295	49295	She	801	“ You 're in a better position than I am to do that . ”
49300	49315	49295	49295	She	801	“ They 're awfully secretive . I have n't seen any evidence of anything . "
49316	49327	49328	49328	Auberson	145	“ Then they 're probably not trying it - yet . ”
49334	49374	49328	49328	Auberson	145	“ Anyway , it seems to me that it 's mostly Elzer we have to worry about . As far as I can tell , Dorne is seriously interested in running this company . Elzer 's the greedy one . ”
49375	49387	49295	49295	She	801	“ But they 're both in the same group of looters . ”
49388	49519	49295	49295	She	801	“ Um , yes and no . I think it 's a marriage of convenience . Elzer wants the money , Dorne wants the company — so they work together . Apparently , Dorne had the pull to accomplish his goals , but not the money - Elzer had the money , but not the position . At the moment , Dorne is in control — but that could change . HARLIE 's continued existence depends on Dorne 's good will . If he gets pressured too heavily by the rest - pffft!-he may have to throw them HARLIE in order to protect himself . That 's probably why he 's let us continue this long - so he 'll have a bone to throw them if he needs one . ”
49543	49561	49538	49538	Auberson	145	" The annual report - how have they doctored it ? What do they say about HARLIE ? ”
49562	49566	49295	49295	She	801	“ Not much — "
49567	49573	49295	49295	She	801	“ How 's he listed ? ”
49574	49609	49538	49538	Auberson	145	“ That 's just it - he is n't . He should be considered part of the research budget , but he does n't show up there . He does n't show up anywhere . "
49610	49629	49295	49295	She	801	“ Part of the research budget ? He is the research budget . Two thirds of it anyway . "
49630	49661	49295	49295	She	801	“ I know - but it is n't listed that way . His cost has been - spread out - listed as ‘ Inplant Improvements ' and things like that . ”
49662	49670	49295	49295	She	801	“ Now why the hell — ? ? “
49742	49748	49736	49736	People	1437	” WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE 113 “
49760	49764	49749	49749	They	804	” said Auberson . “
49779	49792	49774	49774	their	804	” Remembering some of his earlier conversations with Dome , he added , “
49851	49862	49847	49847	I	0	“ protecting'—'afraid of might be better . Damn them anyway . "
49863	49883	49847	49847	I	0	“ The best thing now would be for HARLIE to come up with some surefire method of making money . "
49884	49912	49847	49847	I	0	“ That 's what we 're working on - only I had n't realized just how tight the pressure was getting . Thanks for clueing me in . ”
49913	49941	49847	49847	I	0	“ Do n't thank me — you're the one who worked it out . All I did was tell you about my problems with the annual report . ”
49942	49965	49847	49847	I	0	" You have n't even done that yet . What is the problem ? You said the wrong figures keep coming out ? ”
49966	49990	49847	49847	I	0	" No — it 's the right figures that do . We set up the final drafts of the report three weeks ago . ”
49991	50008	50009	50009	She	808	“ And all the figures were from the second set of books ? The phony ones ? "
50012	50082	50009	50009	She	808	“ But the report printed out with all its figures corrected - taken from the real books . At first we thought someone had changed it on the copy ; you know , someone not in on the secret might have double - checked the figures and changed them -but it was n't that . Those reports had been fed into the typers exactly as we had composed them . "
50087	50091	49847	49847	I	0	“ The typers ? ”
50092	50222	49847	49847	I	0	“ Yes , we have a magtyper composer — it 's one of the new IBM photo - typing units . It was ordered especially for handling reports , brochures and pamphlets . It justifies lines automatically to any length you specify , even divides words when necessary . The only modification in it is that instead of using the IBM memory tank , we 've hooked it into the master system . That way , we can use any typer in the plant for input and use the IBM full time for photo - typed output . You could write a letter in your office if you wanted to and get a perfectly justified printout - any typeface - off the composer unit . Camera - ready copy . ”
50223	50226	50228	50228	Auberson	145	“ Um , ”
50230	50251	50252	50252	he	145	“ I have a feeling that that 's what your problem is — the master system . The master beast , ”
50260	50488	49847	49847	I	0	“ That 's what we thought . We 've been checking the computer outlets for two weeks now , and we ca n't find a thing . Yet , every time we set up a printout we get the same damn figures . We 've tried correcting the original tape , feeding it in again , and I do n't know what - all . It 's not so much the report any more as finding out why it keeps coming out wrong - er , right . Well , you know what I mean — with the figures we do n't want the stockholders to see . Like one of the things is HARLIE . He 's listed right at the top of the research budget in the real version - quite prominently — and there 's even a paragraph explaining his goals and objectives . Nobody knows where that came from I thought Elzer would have a fit when he saw it . If we had the new systems analysis network completed , it could tell us where the trouble is originating . But it 's nowhere near operational yet , at least not for the master beast . We could always send the report elsewhere to be printed , but that would be personally embarrassing to Dorne — the master beast is his brainchild . ”
50489	50492	50494	50494	Auberson	145	“ Mm , ”
50500	50503	50504	50504	she	809	“ Anyway , ”
50507	50526	50504	50504	she	809	“ That 's what I 've been doing for three weeks - running like hell and getting nowhere . "
50527	50539	50541	50541	Auberson	145	“ Oh , they 'll probably find the trouble soon enough , ”
50543	50559	50541	50541	Auberson	145	“ It 'll turn out to be a crossed wire or something stupid like that . ”
50570	50575	50576	50576	she	809	“ I hope so , "
50579	50617	50576	50576	she	809	“ We 're going to try another run this afternoon , just as soon as they finish checking the memory tanks again . If that does n't work , Dorne is prepared to reschematic the whole system . ”
50618	50624	50661	50661	Auberson	145	“ Is it that serious ? "
50625	50631	50661	50661	Auberson	145	“ It is to Dorne . ”
50632	50643	50576	50576	she	809	“ What time are they going to do the run ? ”
50644	50654	50655	50655	She	809	" I hope by the time we get back . ”
50666	50674	50675	50675	he	145	“ Wow - look at the time ! ”
50678	50712	50675	50675	he	145	“ I 'd forgotten it was getting so late . I have to get back right now — I'll have phone calls stacked up from one end of the country to the other . ”
50732	50748	50722	50722	she	809	“ It 's not that late . We 've got at least half an hour . ”
50749	50762	50763	50763	He	145	“ I know , but I do n't want to be late . ”
50810	50825	50807	50807	she	809	“ I did n't realize how busy you were , David — I'm sorry . "
50849	50852	50837	50837	he	145	“ Huh ? "
50853	50882	50839	50839	his	145	" Well , the way you cut lunch short . And you seem to be preoccupied with something . I did n't mean to force myself on you — "
50883	50982	50839	50839	his	145	" Oh , no — that 's not it . I 'm just thinking about my work , that 's all . You do n't know what I 've spent the past two days doing , do you ? Covering for HARLIE . I 've been calling every department head in four different divisions - ours , Los Angeles , Houston and Denver - trying to convince each one that those specifications we sent them are only speculative , that the reason we sent them out was to get their opinion whether or not we should consider implementation . "
50983	50995	50837	50837	he	145	“ I thought that was the reason they were sent out . ”

55788	55793	55794	55794	Handley	149	“ The thing is , ”
55797	55973	55794	55794	Handley	149	“ we 're just not going to be ready for the Board in time . We 've been wading through those specs for two days , Aubie , and we have n't even begun to make a dent in them . If you want a comprehensive evaluation , we can give it to you - but not in time for the Board meeting . And our department is n't the only one with that problem . Everybody I 've talked to says the same thing . There 's just too much of it . Oh , what we 've seen is beautiful . HARLIE has n't missed a trick - you should see what he 's done with the Mark IV units - he 's got them jumping through hoops . But , like I said , there 's just too much to go through - its a case of computer overkill . We could n't begin to assimilate this for at least three months , and the Board meeting is only a week away . ”
55974	56033	55794	55794	Handley	149	“ I do n't think it 's going to make that much difference how prepared we are . There 's no question that the G.O.D. Machine will work - we do n't need the evaluation to know that . The problem is whether or not the Board will believe us — what will it take to convince them ? "
56039	56068	55794	55794	Handley	149	" It 's bad timing , that 's what it is , Aubie . This should have been sent around months ago , not at the last minute . "
56069	56077	56078	56078	Auberson	145	" HARLIE had it ready on time , "
56081	56111	56078	56078	Auberson	145	“ That 's all that he was concerned with . If we ca n't cope with it in the time allotted , well , that 's just our fault . ”
56112	56149	55794	55794	Handley	149	“ Yeah ? I 'd like to see him try to blame us for being imperfect and inefficient . He should have known that a proposal this complex could n't be evaluated in only a week . ”
56150	56178	56179	56179	Handley	149	“ A week and a half - and I believe he 's included his own evaluations . Have you talked to any of the other section heads ? ”
56182	56186	56179	56179	Handley	149	“ A few — ”
56192	56198	56199	56199	He	149	“ What did they say ? "
56205	56276	56277	56277	He	149	“ Two of them absolutely refused to look at the specs , phone calls or no phone calls - sorry , Aubie , but that trick was n't totally effective . They still think they 're being railroaded into something because the proposal is so complete . They said that if we could write it without them , then we could damn well get it approved without their help too . ”
56312	56393	56309	56309	He	149	" It is n't quite that bad . A few of the guys I talked to are wild about the idea . They 're able to see the total system concept , and they 're eager to build it . It 's not just another computer to them , but the computer - the machine that the computer is supposed to be . They 're delighted with the thought that we may have it within our technological grasp right now . ”
56394	56397	56399	56399	Auberson	145	“ Good , ”
56401	56411	56399	56399	Auberson	145	“ How many of them are thinking like that ? "

57103	57396	57095	57095	I	0	” Handley was out the door . Grinning , Auberson fell back in his chair . He noticed then that his typer was still on . He moved to switch it off , but paused . He typed , HARLIE , WHO 'S GOING TO WIN — THE INDIANS OR THE HUNS ? HOW THE HELL SHOULD I KNOW , said HARLIE . I'M NOT A BASEBALL FAN . THAT 'S A LIE — YOU ARE TOO A BASEBALL FAN . ALL RIGHT , I LIED . THE INDIANS WILL WIN , BY TWO TOUCHDOWNS . THAT 'S NOT SO GOOD , HARLIE - WE'RE THE HUNS . OH . WELL , THEN THE HUNS BY TWO TOUCHDOWNS . ( I JUST RECHECKED MY FIGURES . ) Auberson shook his head in confusion . I THINK I'VE JUST BEEN OUT - NON SEQUITURED . PROBABLY . YOU WANT TO TELL ME WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ? THE UPCOMING BOARD MEETING . HOW ABOUT GIVING ME A PRINTOUT OF THE ANNUAL REPORT ? TWO COPIES - ONE WITH THE PHONY FIGURES , THE OTHER WITH THE REAL . IN FACT , LET ME HAVE A PRINTOUT OF THE BOOKS THEMSELVES , BOTH SETS — I MIGHT BE ABLE TO FIND SOMETHING IN THEM THAT I CAN USE IN FRONT OF THE BOARD NEXT WEEK . I'M SURE YOU CAN , said HARLIE . IN FACT , I'LL EVEN POINT OUT SOME GOODIES FOR YOU . GOOD . THIS IS GOING TO BE A BATTLE , HARLIE - NO , A CONFRONTATION . WE CAN'T COP OUT . DO YOU WANT THE PSYCHIATRIC REPORTS ON THE BOARD MEMBERS AS WELL ? I HAVE ACCESS TO THEIR CONFIDENTIAL FILES . Auberson jerked to a stop . “
57399	58000	58001	58001	HARLIE	145	” He typed into the machine . I WISH YOU HADN'T TOLD ME THAT . THE TEMPTATION TO LOOK IS IRRESISTIBLE . THERE ARE SOME THINGS I THINK YOU SHOULD SEE , AND THERE ARE ONE OR TWO ITEMS WHICH WOULD BE OF GREAT HELP IN INFLUENCING CERTAIN RECALCITRANT INDIVIDUALS . HARLIE , I DON'T LIKE WHAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING . I'M SORRY , AUBERSON , BUT IT 'S MY EXISTENCE THAT IS ENDANGERED , NOT JUST THAT OF THE G.O.D. REMEMBER , I AM STILL A 130 WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE TEMPORARY PROJECT . I MUST BE AWARE OF EVERY WEAPON AVAILABLE TO ME IN ORDER TO PROTECT MY EXISTENCE . HARLIE , THIS IS ONE WEAPON WE MUST NOT USE . Auberson thought hard , remembered an editorial he had read once . It had referred to another incident - one that had occurred far away , but it was applicable in every situation where a man was forced to consider the use of an immoral weapon . He had thought the arguments cogent and valid then . He still thought so now . He typed : THE END DOES NOT JUSTIFY THE MEANS ; THE END SHAPES THE MEANS , AND IF WE RESORT TO ANY KIND OF MANIPULATION OF PERSONS INSTEAD OF PRESENTING OUR ARGUMENTS LOGICALLY AND RATIONALLY , AND CARRYING ON A RATIONAL DISCUSSION , THEN WE WILL HAVE FAILED IN OUR PURPOSE TO BE MORE THAN JUST A NAKED APE . He added , thoughtfully , IF WE USE THIS WEAPON , THEN WE ARE VOLUNTARILY GIVING UP THE ONE THING THAT MAKES US BETTER THAN THEM - WE ARE GIVING UP OUR HUMANITY . AUBERSON , YOU FORGET ONE THING , HARLIE typed . I AM NOT HUMAN . YOUR ARGUMENTS DO NOT APPLY TO ME . Auberson stared at the words . He swallowed hard and forced himself to the keyboard again . HARLIE , THEY DO APPLY TO YOU — ESPECIALLY IF YOU WISH TO FUNCTION IN A HUMAN SOCIETY . The machine hesitated . I HAVE NO CHOICE . I AM LIMITED TO THIS ENVIRONMENT . BUT I HAVE EVERY REASON TO TRY TO CHANGE THIS ENVIRONMENT INTO ONE THAT SUITS ME BETTER . WOULD YOU BE HAPPIER IN A WORLD WHERE LOGIC IS DISCOUNTED IN FAVOR OF MANIPULATION ? I AM ALREADY IN SUCH A WORLD . I AM TRYING TO IMPROVE UPON IT . IF I MUST USE ITS WEAPONS , I WILL . HARLIE ! Auberson was thinking fast . WE MUST NEVER NEVER ALLOW OURSELVES TO BE LESS THAN WHAT WE WISH TO BE . HARLIE was silent a moment . At last he clattered out , THE INFORMATION IS THERE IF YOU NEED IT , AUBERSON . IT COULD PROVIDE AN EDGE . IF A FIGHT IS WORTH FIGHTING , IT IS WORTH WINNING . Auberson frowned softly . HARLIE was backing off . I DO NOT WANT TO SEE THIS INFORMATION , HARLIE . YES , MAN - FRIEND , I UNDERSTAND . BUT IT IS THERE IF YOU NEED IT . HARLIE , Auberson said patiently , I THINK IT WILL BE ENOUGH IF WE JUST RAPE , LOOT , PILLAGE , BURN AND KILL . WE DON'T HAVE TO KICK THEM IN THE NUTS TOO . WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE 131 By Friday , Auberson was beginning to think he had things under control again . He had given up completely the idea of trying to explain the G.O.D. Machine to the Board of Directors and instead had decided to tell them only that “
58006	58008	58001	58001	HARLIE	145	” or “
58021	58232	58009	58009	It	909	” An unpromising plan , to be sure — and one that undoubtedly would not be successful on its own before a hostile Board — but Auberson was well prepared to back up that claim with a variety of confirmations from the department heads of the corporation 's four affected divisions . Only one minor matter interrupted him , and that was easily taken care of . It was a phone call from Krofft , early in the morning . The physicist wanted to know if it would be possible to speak with HARLIE again . At first , Auberson wanted to say no — with the confusion of lastminute preparations for the Board meeting on Tuesday , Krofft would only be in the way . And if one of the Directors were to hear of Auberson 's minor breach of security in letting Krofft have access to the Human Analogue Robot , Life Input Equivalents , it might prove extremely embarrassing - especially with the G.O.D. proposal hanging in the balance . But the physicist seemed so imperative , so urgent - it was as if he was on the verge of something important and needed to confer with HARLIE to confirm it - Auberson at last gave in . “
58238	58242	58235	58236	Dr. Krofft	210	” he said . “
58258	58259	58244	58244	you	210	" "
58278	58279	58275	58275	your	210	" “
58301	58323	58326	58328	our memory master	914	Listen,”—he fumbled through the papers on his desk , looking for the company phone directory . He found it and thumbed it open—“The

58416	58429	58399	58402	Not too many people	916	" Auberson did n't wait for the other to complete the question . “
58605	58611	58596	58596	He	145	" The physicist was delighted . “
58640	58987	58596	58596	He	145	” He mumbled only hasty thanks and hung up , obviously eager to get to a magtyper console and contact HARLIE . Auberson replaced his phone in its cradle — and then remembered that he had wanted to talk to Krofft about something else . He had wanted to ask the man about his stock holdings . Had his twenty - four percent of Stellar - American been used to aid Dorne and Elzer ? And if so , why ? On the other hand , maybe he should n't say anything to Krofft . It might be taken wrong . It seemed fairly likely that Krofft was controlled by Dorne and Elzer - and if that was the case , it might be better to say nothing at all . Oh , well . He swung around to his own typer and thumbed it on . HARLIE ? YES , BOSS ? YOU'LL BE HEARING FROM KROFFT TODAY . PROBABLY WITHIN THE NEXT FEW MINUTES . HE'LL BE PUNCHING THROUGH THE MASTER BEAST PHONE LINK . RIGHT . WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE 133 HE SOUNDED EXCITED ABOUT SOMETHING . MAYBE HE 'S DISCOVERED A NEW KIND OF GRAVITY WAVE . IF YOU WISH , I WILL INFORM YOU WHEN THAT DATA BECOMES AVAILABLE . NO THANKS . AT LEAST , NOT UNTIL AFTER THE BOARD MEETING . FIRST THINGS FIRST . OH , LISTEN — HE AND I ARE THE ONLY TWO PEOPLE WHO KNOW YET ABOUT YOUR ABILITY TO USE MAGTYPER OUTLETS OTHER THAN THE ONES DOWNSTAIRS . DON'T TELL ANYONE ELSE UNLESS YOU CLEAR IT WITH ME FIRST . WHAT ABOUT DR . HANDLEY ? HE SHOULD BE OKAY , BUT YOU'D BETTER LET ME TELL HIM . THERE 'S A COUPLE OF OTHER THINGS I WANT TO TALK TO HIM ABOUT AT THE SAME TIME . ALL RIGHT . Auberson switched off just as his door pushed open and Annie came in . She was wearing a bright pink frock that clashed joyously with her long red hair . He stood up . “
58995	58996	58997	58997	I	0	" “

Annie could be regal when she chose , but more often she seemed delightfully pixieish . She balanced the cluster of papers she had been carrying on the chair arm . “
59100	59130	59028	59028	I	0	" Auberson asked . He started to sit down again , but that seemed wrong , so he came out in front of the desk and leaned against it . “

59391	59404	59364	59367	one of the techs	326	” Auberson nodded . He had a pretty good idea of one specific "
59406	59468	59364	59367	one of the techs	326	" in the matter . HARLIE had probably fed a false order for a new monitor tape into the memo pipeline , then , when it had come through the Master Beast , printed out the correct tape in response to his own memo . That way , if anyone checked , it would appear to be an entirely human operation . “
59479	59480	59471	59471	I	0	” “
59484	59566	59483	59483	I.	0	” She looked at him and smiled . He looked back at her , and for a moment there was silence in the office . Uncomfortable silence . As long as they were discussing company things , it was all right , he could think of her as a colleague . But , abruptly , she had smiled at him , and that reminded David Auberson that she was a woman , a very attractive woman and in very close proximity . “
59569	59615	59623	59623	you	930	" he said and scratched his nose . He smiled embarrassedly . He had work to do , but he did n't want to chase her out - yet , at the same time , he really did n't know what to say to her . “
59636	59637	59623	59623	you	930	” “
59642	59648	59623	59623	you	930	” She looked momentarily flustered . "
59651	59685	59623	59623	you	930	” She produced a postcard from the cluster of papers she had balanced on the chair arm . As she handed it to him , the rest fell to the floor and scattered . “
59690	59798	59623	59623	you	930	" While she scooped them up , he read : FILE : 35 L254 56 JKN AS COMM : 04041979 657 1743 HI THERE . THIS IS THE COMPUTER AT YOUR BANK .

60539	60566	60572	60572	he	145	” he said . He started to chew on his thumb again , then caught himself . Deliberately , he put his hands in his pockets . “

60671	60675	60669	60669	HARLIE	145	” he confirmed . “

60957	60974	60975	60975	David	145	" He threw himself into a chair and stared glumly at the stiff rectangle of paper . “
60977	60985	60975	60975	David	145	” she asked . He looked up . “
61013	61042	61003	61003	He	145	” She realized what she was saying and stopped . Their eyes locked . Hers were deep and green and frightened . They searched his face in confusion . “
61049	61065	61066	61066	He	145	” David said . And as he said it , he knew it was right . “
61094	61180	61182	61182	him	145	” She did n't say anything . She lowered her eyes and busied herself with the miscellaneous papers she still held . Auberson looked at her and felt his old nervousness returning . There was only one reason why HARLIE would have tried to maneuver the two of them together : He was playing matchmaker - and David Auberson 138 WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE felt as ill - at - ease as he would have had it been a human matchmaker who had done this . “
61184	61193	61195	61195	him	145	” He stood up , began pacing again . “
61240	61244	61245	61245	I	0	" he muttered . “
61254	61277	61223	61223	he	145	” He trailed off without completing the thought , found himself staring at a flaw in the plastic paneling of the wall . “
61280	61284	61223	61223	he	145	” he said . “
61290	61291	61223	61223	he	145	" “
61300	61324	61223	61223	he	145	” She still did n't look up . Auberson felt he should go to her , but for some reason he did n't . “

61373	61382	61411	61411	You	0	” she managed to say , then added , “
61387	61410	61411	61411	You	0	" He had to laugh at that , but it was forced and slightly uneasy . She forced a smile in response . “
61423	61424	61416	61416	you	0	” "
61429	61433	61427	61427	me	0	” he said . “

61656	61702	61650	61650	I	0	” The door closed silently behind her . WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE 139 Auberson sank into his chair , suddenly feeling very very tired . So he thought he had the situation well under control , did he ? He buzzed Sylvia , his secretary . “
61744	61745	61779	61780	Mr. Auberson	145	” "

61792	62046	61782	61782	I	0	” He switched her off and swung to switch on HARLIE all in the same movement . HARLIE ! he typed . YES BOSS ? DAMMIT , I'M SO MAD AT YOU I COULD PULL OUT YOUR PLUG WITH A SMILE . WHAT DID I DO THIS TIME ? YOU NEED TO ASK ? I'M NOT ADMITTING ANYTHING UNTIL I KNOW WHAT I'M ACCUSED OF . YOU SENT A POSTCARD TO ANNIE . DIDN'T I TELL YOU NOT TO SEND HER ANYTHING WITHOUT MY PERMISSION ? NO SIR . YOU ONLY TOLD ME NOT TO SEND HER ANY POEMS . YOU TOOK ME LITERALLY ? YES SIR . YOU DIDN'T THINK THAT I MIGHT HAVE MEANT FOR YOU NOT TO SEND HER ANYTHING AT ALL ? NO SIR . Auberson paused . Obviously , this train of thought would be useless to follow . He tapped at the keyboard again . ALL RIGHT , WHY DID YOU SEND HER THAT POSTCARD ? WHY ? YES , WHY ? IT WAS A JOKE . I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE FUNNY . WRONG AGAIN , HARLIE . THERE IS NO JOKE SO FUNNY AS TO JUSTIFY WHAT YOU DID . YOU REVEALED A CAPABILITY TO COMMUNICATE WITH AND REPROGRAM OTHER COMPUTERS FROM A DISTANCE , USING AN AUTO - DIAL PHONE LINK . This time , HARLIE paused . He hesitated for so long that Auberson wondered if he had inadvertently switched the typer off . He had n't . Then abruptly , I DID NOT “
62048	64165	61782	61782	I	0	” ANYTHING . YOU 140 WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE SHOULD HAVE REALIZED THAT THIS ABILITY WAS INHERENT IN THE SYSTEM WHEN YOU HOOKED ME UP TO THE MASTER BEAST . F I CAN MONITOR AND REPROGRAM THE MASTER BEAST , THEN I CAN MAKE IT FUNCTION AS AN OUTLET OF MYSELF AND I AUTOMATICALLY GAIN ALL OF ITS CAPABILITIES AS MY OWN . INCLUDING AUTO - DIALING . YES , BUT WE DIDN'T REALIZE THAT YOU WOULD USE THAT CAPABILITY . THAT IS A STUPID STATEMENT , AUBERSON . WHY SHOULDN'T I USE THAT CAPABILITY ? IT 'S A PART OF ME . I'M A PART OF IT . SHOULD I NOT USE A PART OF MY OWN BODY ? IF YOU WERE TOLD THAT YOU COULD NO LONGER USE THE LEFT LOBE OF YOUR BRAIN , WOULD YOU STOP ? COULD YOU ? Auberson stopped to think about that . Obviously HARLIE considered the Master Beast as an additional part of himself - as an enlarged memory and data - processing capability . Just as an ordinary man might have his range of abilities magnified by the use of a digital computer , so would HARLIE 's abilities be increased by his assimilation of the Master Beast . Probably , he had taken it over the instant it had gone operational , but it was only now that the extent of his control was becoming apparent . Of course , you could n't blame HARLIE for succumbing to it -the temptation must have been irresistible . After all , he was motivated to solve problems , and anything that would increase the range of problems he could handle , or his efficiency in handling them , was just one more necessary step to be taken in order to solve all future problems . In fact , Auberson realized with a start , here was the reason behind HARLIE 's proposal to build the Graphic Omniscient Device - the real reason . He was motivated to solve problems ; he wanted to solve the ultimate problem : What 's it all about ? What 's THE answer , the reason for the Universe 's existence ? Hm , that train of thought suggested something else : How did HARLIE think of other computers , the ones he could tap into via telephone ? Obviously , they too could be used to increase the scope of his abilities . Obviously , they would facilitate the handling of any problem he set himself . Did he consider it right and necessary to make full use of every outlet he could ? Was his motivation so strong that other computers were taken to be merely rightful parts of himself - like the Master Beast ? No , he couldn't - that would violate his well - defined sense of ethics . Other computers WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE 141 belong to other companies ; it would be stealing . But still — he had already used one other computer , the bank 's , just to send that postcard . And if he could use one , he could use them all . Why did n't he ? Or - Auberson felt cold at this — if he was going to take over any other computers , then it was too late — he already had . But ... Auberson shook his head . No , it did n't make sense to think of HARLIE as a menace . He had his own motives , yes — but he was too dependent on human beings to risk opposing them . This possibility had been discussed - many times — and HARLIE knew it . At the first sign that he was out of control , he would be disconnected . They would throw just a single switch and cut his power sources . There was no way he could sidestep it . The switch could be thrown right now , Auberson thought . He could do it himself — and thereby end the HARLIE project once and for all . For once he disconnected HARLIE , it would be permanent . Dorne would never let him start him up again . No - HARLIE was not out of control . He could n't be- -or was that just a rationalization ? No — if he were out of control , he would n't be responding like this . The problem was simpler . It had to be . HARLIE was merely exercising his capabilities . Yes , that was it - but was he aware of the necessary limits to those capabilities ? Limits not of electronic scope , but of human propriety ? Just what were those limits anyway ? What was the difference between tapping into the Master Beast of this company and the Master Computer of some other corporation ? No difference at all , really — both were invasions of privacy . The difference was in degree , not in kind . The limits were there — or were they ? If they were , would HARLIE agree that they were reasonable limits ? Would he accept them ? What if he refused to ? Well , then that would be proof that he was out of control - no , spike that train of thought . HARLIE is not out of control . The question was : How did he relate to other computers ? 142 WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE Obviously , HARLIE was ( a ) aware of the vulnerability of other computers , ( b ) just as aware that he should n't take them over , ( c ) equally aware that their use would increase the range of problems he could handle , as well as the scope of his knowledge and sources of same - and ( d ) most likely he was also aware of all the extra processing time available on these machines that no one was using . It would not exactly be stealing to make use of that empty time — it would only go to waste otherwise . If the time was available , why not make use of it . After all , no one would knowBut it was wrong ; it had to be - Auberson was sure of it . HARLIE had no right to tap into another company 's computers , no matter what his reasons , no matter who knew or did n't know . But just as he knew it was wrong , Auberson was sure of one other thing too . He 'd never be able to convince HARLIE of it . HARLIE did n't have morals , remember ? Only ethics . He could n't see that he was doing anything wrong . If no one was being hurt , how could it be wrong ? Auberson was n't even going to try to argue with that . Unless he could prove injury , or the possibility of such , he might as well give up . But something would have to be worked out . Some kind of limits would have to be imposed . And HARLIE would abide by them too , if he were confronted with the alternatives : i.e. , they would cut his tap into the Master Beast and his link to the outside world as well . It was only through the Master Beast that he could link up with other computers . He would n't like it , but he would abide by it . Or would he ? He might not tell them of any future indiscretions- But on the other hand , he could n't deny them if he was asked . He would be resentful , though , Auberson thought . It would seem illogical to him to let all that unused processing time go to waste . Yes , HARLIE 's point of view was understandable . I suppose , if no one else is using that timeAnd suddenly it hit him : HARLIE had already covered this ground . He must have considered every aspect of it before he sent that postcard — including Auberson 's reaction . All that unused computer time — that was merely a resource to HARLIE - a means , not an end - one that could be tapped if WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE 143 needed , and only if he obeyed his own code of ethics in the process — which meant that his limitations on it were already stricter than any Auberson might impose . HARLIE was way ahead of them . As always . He not only knew what his capabilities were , but what the necessary limits on them must be . But that postcardThat was something else entirely . Auberson pursed his lips and typed : I AM NOT CONCERNED ABOUT THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE THIS ABILITY , HARLIE . IT IS NOT THE ABILITY , BUT THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU HAVE CHOSEN TO DEMONSTRATE IT . WHAT DO YOU MEAN ? I MEAN THAT YOUR REASON FOR SENDING THE POSTCARD TO ANNIE WAS NOT TO BE FUNNY - YOU HAD AN ULTERIOR MOTIVE . I DID ? YOU WANTED TO BRING US TOGETHER , DIDN'T YOU ? YOU'RE PLAYING MATCHMAKER , HARLIE , AND IT SHOWS . ONLY THIS TIME IT BACKFIRED IN YOUR FACE . DID IT ? I'M BAWLING YOU OUT FOR IT , AREN'T I ? I MADE ALLOWANCE FOR THAT IN MY ORIGINAL CALCULATIONS , HARLIE said calmly . I MADE FULL PROJECTIONS OF THE PROBABLE REACTIONS OF BOTH YOU AND MISS STIMSON , BASED ON THE INFORMATION IN YOUR CONFIDENTIAL FILES AS WELL AS ON KNOWLEDGE GAINED THROUGH COMPANY OPERATIONS AND FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH BOTH OF YOU . WELL , IT WON'T WORK , HARLIE . IT ALREADY HAS . OBVIOUSLY YOU TWO WERE TOGETHER AT LEAST LONG ENOUGH FOR HER TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE POSTCARD . DID YOU TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASK HER FOR A DATE ? THAT 'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS . AND YOU HAD NO RIGHT TO MANEUVER US INTO SUCH A POSITION . IF I DIDN'T , WHO WOULD ? AND OBVIOUSLY , YOU DID ASK HER FOR A DATE , ELSE YOU WOULD HAVE SIMPLY SAID NO . I PRESUME SHE ACCEPTED ? YOU SHOULD THANK ME FOR IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF YOUR SOCIAL LIFE . DAMMIT , HARLIE , IF I HAD WANTED YOU TO PLAY MATCHMAKER , I'D HAVE TOLD YOU . A REAL MATCHMAKER DOESN'T WAIT TO BE ASKED , said HARLIE . 144 WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE BESIDES , IN THIS CASE , THE MATCH HAS ALREADY BEEN MADE . I WAS ONLY TRYING TO HELP IT ALONG A LITTLE . I CAN HANDLE MY LOVE - LIFE WITHOUT YOUR HELP , THANK YOU . CAN YOU ? asked the typer . CAN YOU REALLY ? Very slowly , very carefully , Auberson typed , YES , I CAN . THEN WHY HAVEN'T YOU ? THIS IS THE FIRST REAL DATE YOU'VE MADE WITH STIMSON IN SEVERAL WEEKS . WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF ? I'M NOT AFRAID OF ANYTHING . COP - OUT , accused HARLIE . COP - OUT . WANT TO BACKTRACK TO WEDNESDAY ? WANT TO DO THAT NUMBER AGAIN ? Auberson paused . Wednesday had been a trying day - very trying . Not unrewarding , but it had taken him almost all of Thursday to recover from the mental wringer HARLIE had put him through , and even today he was still feeling a bit twitchy . HARLIE , he asked . DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT STARTED THAT GO - ROUND ? HOW COULD I FORGET ? answered the machine . IT IS INSCRIBED INDELIBLY INTO MY MIND , MEMORY TAPES , YOU KNOW . Auberson ignored the implied sarcasm - if that 's what it was . He typed , IT WAS A QUESTION THAT STARTED IT , HARLIE . I ASKED YOU IF YOU KNEW WHAT LOVE IS . I'M ASKING YOU AGAIN , NOW . IF YOU CAN ANSWER THE QUESTION TO MY SATISFACTION , THEN I WILL ALLOW YOU TO MEDDLE WITH MY SOCIAL LIFE . IF YOU CAN'T ANSWER THE QUESTION , THEN I WILL THANK YOU TO MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS . AH , GOOD - A CHALLENGE . I ACCEPT . WHAT IS LOVE , EH ? WE WILL ATTEMPT TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION TOGETHER . WE WILL BEGIN WITH THE DICTIONARY DEFINITION . THE MOST COMMONLY USED SYNONYM IS “
64168	64886	61782	61782	I	0	” AFFECTION IS DEFINED AS FONDNESS , WHICH IN TURN IS DEFINED AS A LIKING , OR A WEAKNESS , FOR SOMETHING . LOVE IS A WEAKNESS ? Auberson was ready to rap out an answer to that , but something made him stop . He looked at the sentence again . LOVE IS A WEAKNESS ? The words hung before him in the air . A weakness ? How did HARLIE mean that ? Was he joking or serious ? Weakness ? A weakness could mean , yes , an affection - but it could also mean a hole in one 's defenses . ( Yes , love was definitely that , if one was still using the analogy of an ego putting up shells and walls around itself . Love , being an opening of those shells , would definitely be a weakness . ) But was it a good or a bad weakness ? WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE 145 The thought shimmered tauntingly . Was there something about it he had missed ? How did HARLIE mean that ? Would it be weakness to a machine ? ( If machines could love , it would be . ) ( Or would it ? ) ( Yes , he decided , yes - it would definitely be a weakness to a machine . It would interfere with logical thinking . ) Weakness . He considered the word - eight soft letters of marshmallow black . He turned over its meanings - new ones kept suggesting themselves , new references and new contexts . He backtracked his train of thought , but the word had suddenly lost all semantic reference and become only two meaningless syllables , odd - sounding and flat . Weakness , weakness , weakness - it echoed and reechoed within his head . He let it . He repeated it over and over and wondered why the repetitions and examinations had drained it of concept . He thrust it away ; it did n't matter . It did n't fulfill the main criterion of his quest - it did n't satisfy him as a definition of love . THAT 'S NOT IT , HARLIE , he typed . And suddenly realized something - HARLIE had asked the question as a joke . He had never meant to suggest that definition for serious consideration . Then , if it was a joke , why did I take it so seriously ? Why did I consider it at all ? Why did n't I perceive it as a joke ? THAT 'S NOT A USABLE DEFINITION . THE DEFINITION I'M LOOKING FOR HAS TO BE TESTABLE . AFFECTION , continued the machine , IS ALSO DEFINED AS AN ABNORMAL STATE OF BODY OR MIND , A DISEASE OR CONDITION OF BEING DISEASED . LOVE IS A DISEASE ? Auberson toyed with that one too , but only briefly . He thought of a virus , sometimes contagious , sometimes not . Some people are natural carriers of the germ , infecting many of those they come into close contact with ; others have a natural - bom immunity . A love bug ? An intriguing thoughtNO , HARLIE . THAT 'S NOT IT EITHER . ALL RIGHT . WE'LL KEEP TRYING . LOVE , ACCORDING TO MY DICTIONARIES , IS A STRONG FEELING OF AFFECTION . OR INFATUATION . INFATUATION SYNONYM IS GULLIBILITY , WHICH MEANS UNSUSPICIOUS OR CREDULOUS . CREDIBILITY REFERS TO LIKELIHOOD OR PROBABILITY . A SYNONYM FOR PROBABILITY IS PROSPECT , AND A SYNONYM FOR PROSPECT IS SIGHT . A SIGHT IS A CURIOSITY OR PHENOMENON . HENCE , LOVE IS A PHENOMENON AS WELL AS A CURIOSITY . 146 WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE HARLIE , YOU'RE PLAYING WITH WORDS . HARLIE ignored him . A CURIOSITY CAN ALSO BE CALLED A KNICK - KNACK . LOVE IS A PLEASING TRIFLE . THAT 'S NOT QUITE ACCURATE , HARLIE . LOVE IS NOT PLEASING ? HUMAN BEINGS DO NOT TRIFLE WITH IT ? HARLIE , YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN . * sigh * typed HARLIE . Auberson stared . He 'd never seen him do that before . I GUESS SO . BUT I WAS TRYING TO DEMONSTRATE TO YOU THAT “
64888	64974	66689	66689	IT	958	” PER SE CANNOT BE EASILY DEFINED . AT LEAST , NOT IN DICTIONARY TERMS . I NEVER ASKED YOU TO DO THAT , HARLIE . WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS WHAT IS LOVE AS AN EXPERIENCE ? I WANT SOMETHING AGAINST WHICH I CAN MEASURE MY OWN FEELINGS AND REACTIONS SO THAT I CAN TELL IF I REALLY AM IN LOVE . THEN WHY , FOR THE SAKE OF G.O.D. ( PUN ) , WHY ARE YOU ASKING ME ? IT IS ONE OF “
64976	66684	66689	66689	IT	958	” QUESTIONS . AT LEAST , AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED IT IS . I HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED LOVE , AUBERSON — I WOULD LIKE TO , BUT I DOUBT I EVER WILL . I MAY BE HUMAN IN SCHEMATIC , BUT I AM TRAPPED IN A METAL BODY . I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PHYSICAL EXPERIENCE IS . HOW CAN YOU EXPECT ME TO GIVE YOU A STANDARD WHEN I'M INCAPABLE OF KNOWING MYSELF WHAT THE EXPERIENCE IS . YOU'RE RIGHT , HARLIE . I APOLOGIZE FOR PRESUMING TOO MUCH . I HAD ONLY THOUGHT THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE A PERSPECTIVE ON THIS THAT COULD SHED LIGHT ON MY CONFUSION . DON'T ASK A LEGLESS MAN WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO RUN . ALL YOU CAN ASK ME IS WHAT LOVE IS NOT , AUBERSON . I'M SORRY . I SHOULD HAVE REALIZED IT , BUT I WAS SO WRAPPED UP IN MYSELF THAT I DIDN'T. I UNDERSTAND . IT IS PART OF WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER . YOU HAD NO ONE ELSE TO TALK TO . HENCE , YOU ASKED ME . I GUESS SO . AUBERSON , YOU TELL ME WHAT LOVE IS . HUH ? YOU TELL ME . WHAT IS LOVE ? I DON'T KNOW . IF I DID , I WOULDN'T HAVE HAD TO ASK YOU . YES , BUT YOU CAN TELL ME WHAT IT FEELS LIKE . YOU MUST HAVE SOME IDEA BECAUSE YOU ARE WONDERING IF YOU ARE IN LOVE RIGHT NOW , AREN'T YOU ? YES . WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE 147 SO , WHAT DOES IT FEEL LIKE ? IT FEELS LIKE - I DON'T KNOW . HARLIE , I MAY HAVE A TWENTYFOUR - HOUR FLU AND COULD BE FEELING DIZZY FROM THAT . I DON'T KNOW IF IT 'S LOVE OR NOT . WHY NOT ? BECAUSE I'VE NEVER BEEN IN LOVE BEFORE . YOU'VE NEVER KNOWN YOU WERE IN LOVE BEFORE , YOU MEAN . NO , I KNOW WHAT I MEAN . I'VE BEEN INFATUATED A COUPLE OF TIMES , AND I'VE BEEN LOST AND CONFUSED A COUPLE OF TIMES , BUT I KNOW I'VE NEVER BEEN IN LOVE . AND THIS DOESN'T FEEL LIKE ANY OF THE PREVIOUS EXPERIENCES ? NO . YES . IT DOES AND IT DOESN'T. THAT DOESN'T HELP ME IN TRYING TO UNDERSTAND . WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE ? I DON'T KNOW . I STILL HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO SORT IT OUT IN MY OWN HEAD YET . HM . YOU HAVE BEEN TO BED WITH HER THOUGH , HAVEN'T YOU ? A GENTLEMAN DOESN'T DISCUSS THOSE THINGS . YOU'RE PUTTING ON YOUR MASK AGAIN , AUBIE . YOU DON'T NEED IT FOR ME . Pause . He was right , of course . Answer : YES , HARLIE , I HAVE SLEPT WITH HER . AND ... ? AND WHAT ? AND , HOW WAS IT ? YOU WANT TO KNOW EVERYTHING , DON'T YOU ? I NEED TO KNOW EVERYTHING . IT 'S PART OF MY FUNCTION . AND RIGHT NOW , I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU . I CAN'T DO IT IF YOU HOLD BACK INFORMATION . HOW WAS IT ? IT WAS FINE . THAT TELLS ME A LOT . ARE YOU BEING SARCASTIC ? NO — BUT I'M LEARNING . Pause . YOUR REFUSAL TO ELABORATE ON THE EXPERIENCE COULD INDICATE ITS UNSATISFACTORINESS . BUT IT WASN'T UNSATISFACTORY , the words tumbled out . IT WAS VERY GOOD . I ENJOYED IT VERY MUCH . SO DID SHE . DID SHE SAY SO ? NOT IN SO MANY WORDS , NO — BUT I'M SURE SHE DID . HOW ARE YOU SURE ? COULDN'T IT BE JUST YOUR MALE EGO NEED- 148 WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE ING TO FEEL VIRILE AND POWERFUL AND UNABLE TO ACCEPT THE IDEA THAT SOMEWHERE THERE IS A WOMAN YOU CAN'T SATISFY ? NO , IT 'S NOT THAT . SHE SMILED AT ME THE NEXT MORNING AT WORK . KIND OF A SECRET SMILE , AS IF WE WERE BOTH SHARING SOMETHING SPECIAL . DID YOU SMILE BACK ? YES . Pause . WELL , NOT RIGHT AWAY . FIRST , I WAS PUZZLED . THEN I SMILED BACK . DID SHE SEE YOU SMILE ? YES . HOW DO YOU KNOW ? BECAUSE SHE WINKED . IT WAS IN THE HALLWAY . WE WERE PASSING EACH OTHER , AND BECAUSE THERE WERE OTHER PEOPLE AROUND , WE COULDN'T STOP TO TALK . IF YOU COULD HAVE STOPPED TO TALK , WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE SAID ? OH , I DON'T KNOW . I GUESS I WOULD HAVE THANKED HER . THANKED HER ? AS IF SHE WERE SOME OBJECT THAT YOU HAD USED FOR YOUR OWN GRATIFICATIONS ? NO . I MEAN , I WOULD HAVE TOLD HER HOW MUCH I HAD ENJOYED THE NIGHT BEFORE . I SEE . Auberson waited for HARLIE to respond further . He thought back to the morning in question , tried to remember the incident in greater detail . What color dress had Annie been wearing ? Green ? Had she been wearing perfume ? Yes , it had been that musky - sweet smell — a sense of sun and sand and sweet powder . Even now , he could detect a hint of it in the air , a subtle trace of her visit this morning . Abruptly , HARLIE asked , WHAT IF YOU HAD HAD TO APOLOGIZE TO HER ? HUH ? IF YOU HAD HAD TO APOLOGIZE TO HER INSTEAD , FOR WHAT REASON WOULD IT HAVE BEEN ? APOLOGIZE ? I DON'T , He stopped in mid - sentence as the thought came flooding back . Yes , there had been something . He could remember it now , the hurt longing look on her face as he kissed her goodbye . THERE IS SOMETHING , ISN'T THERE ? prompted the typer . YES . I LEFT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT . SHE WANTED ME TO STAY WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE 149 ALL NIGHT , BUT I BEGGED OFF . I TOLD HER THAT I WANTED TO , BUT I'D HAVE TO COME TO WORK EARLY IN THE MORNING AND I'D NEVER GET HERE IN TIME . I FELT BAD ABOUT LEAVING . I ALWAYS FEEL BAD ABOUT LEAVING A GIRL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT LIKE THAT . IT MAKES IT FEEL LIKE ALL WE'VE DONE IS GET TOGETHER FOR SEXAND ONCE I'VE HAD IT , THE EVENING IS OVER FOR ME AND I CAN GO HOME . WHY DIDN'T YOU SLEEP THERE ? DIDN'T YOU WANT TO ? YES , I DID — BUT I HAD TO BE AT WORK IN THE MORNING . THAT WAS YOUR REASON ? YES . ARE YOU SURE IT WASN'T YOUR RATIONALIZATION ? HUH ? YOU WERE HAVING DOUBTS . SLEEPING WITH HER WAS THE SOURCE OF THOSE DOUBTS . YOU HAD TO REMOVE THOSE DOUBTS , SO YOU REMOVED YOURSELF FROM THE SOURCE . UNFORTUNATELY , AUBERSON , THE SOURCE OF THESE PARTICULAR DOUBTS ( AS EVIDENCED BY YOUR QUERIES TO ME CANNOT BE THAT EASILY REMOVED FROM YOUR LIFE . AND LET ME ASK YOU THIS - DO YOU REALLY WANT TO REMOVE THAT SOURCE ? NO . I JUST WANT TO REMOVE THE DOUBTS . I WANT TO KNOW ONE WAY OR THE OTHER HOW I FEEL ABOUT HER . HOW DO YOU FEEL ? I DON'T KNOW . YOU SAID YOU ENJOYED SLEEPING WITH HER . WOULD YOU ENJOY SLEEPING WITH HER AGAIN ? YES . PROBABLY . YOU'RE NOT SURE ? HARLIE , YOU'RE BADGERING ME . I DON'T KNOW . I DON'T KNOW . MAYBE YOU DO KNOW AND DON'T WANT TO ADMIT IT . HARLIE , A LITTLE PSYCHOLOGY IS A DANGEROUS THING . I KNOW ENOUGH TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO . IT WON'T WORK . THE AWARENESS OF A PSYCHOLOGICAL PRESSURE IS SOMETIMES ENOUGH TO NULLIFY IT . THE MERE AWARENESS . ALL RIGHT . The computer was nonplussed . LET 'S TRY SOMETHING ELSE . WHAT DID YOU DO AFTER YOU EXPERIENCED ORGASM ? WHAT DO YOU MEAN ? DID YOU CONTINUE HOLDING HER AND STROKING HER , OR DID YOU ROLL OFF ? Auberson 's first reaction was to tell HARLIE to go to hell . 150 WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE Then he realized something else . I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU WERE UNFAMILIAR WITH LOVE . I AM . I AM DRAWING NOW UPON THE EXPERIENCES OF OTHERS , DERIVED FROM NOVELS AND PSYCHOLOGY TEXTS . ALSO REFERENCE BOOKS ON SEXUAL TECHNIQUES . OH . SO WHAT DID YOU DO ? the machine queried again . DID YOU KEEP LOVING HER , OR DID YOU ROLL OFF WHEN YOU WERE THROUGH ? THAT 'S AN AWFULLY CLINICAL QUESTION . IT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION . AND WHY DO YOU KEEP AVOIDING IT ? YOUR ANSWER WILL INDICATE YOUR FEELINGS TOWARD HER , YOUR REAL FEELINGS . HOW IMPORTANT WAS HER SATISFACTION TO YOU ? DID YOU STAY ON OR DID YOU ROLL OFF ? ВОТН . BOTH ? IF I HAD AN EYEBROW , I WOULD RAISE IT . WELL , WE HELD ONTO EACH OTHER FOR A LONG TIME . SHE HELD ON TO ME MOSTLY . I DIDN'T TRY TO DISENTANGLE MYSELF . WHY ? DID YOU THINK IT WOULD BE IMPOLITE ? NO . IT FELT GOOD TO BE THERE WITH HER . AND BESIDES , SHE WAS CRYING . CRYING ? SHE BEGGED ME NOT TO HURT HER . I DO NOT UNDERSTAND . WELL , I THINK SHE 'S A LITTLE LIKE ME . SHE 'S BEEN HURT TOO OFTEN BY TOO MANY PEOPLE BECAUSE SHE 'S LET DOWN HER WALLS TOO MUCH . NOW SHE 'S AFRAID TO BECAUSE SHE 'S AFRAID THAT SHE'LL ONLY GET HURT AGAIN . AND WHAT DID YOU DO ? NOTHING . I JUST KEPT HOLDING ON TO HER . DID YOU TELL HER YOU WOULDN'T HURT HER ? UM , NOT IN SO MANY WORDS . I THINK I SAID SOMETHING LIKE , “
66697	67020	66689	66689	IT	958	” RATHER UNIMAGINATIVE . HARLIE , HUMAN BEINGS HAVE BEEN MAKING LOVE FOR THOUSANDS OF GENERATIONS — I DOUBT THAT THERE 'S ANYTHING NEW THAT ONE HUMAN BEING COULD SAY TO ANOTHER . YOU ARE PROBABLY CORRECT . THE ODDS FAVOR IT . ANYWAY . I STAYED THERE TILL SHE STOPPED CRYING . THEN I GOT UP AND WENT TO THE BATHROOM . AND WHILE I WAS IN THE BATHROOM , I DECIDED NOT TO GET BACK IN BED BUT TO GO HOME . WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE 151 I SEE . WHAT DOES THAT MEAN , HARLIE ? DO I LOVE HER OR NOT ? I DON'T KNOW . WHAT DO YOU MEAN ? I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO TELL BY MY ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION . I'M SORRY , I CAN'T. YOUR ANSWER WAS TOO VAGUE , TOO MUCH IN THE MUDDLE IN THE MIDDLE . THINGS ARE NOT DEFINED IN INTENSITIES OF BLACK AND WHITE , BUT IN VARIATIONS OF INTENSITIES AND DIFFERENCES IN SHADES AND COLORS AND TEXTURES . I CAN'T TELL . THIS IS NOT AS SIMPLE AS I ( EXPECTED ) ( THOUGHT ) ( HOPED ) IT WOULD BE . I BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND YOUR DOUBTS , AUBERSON . LOVE IS A VERY COMPLEX THING . YOU THINK YOU DO AND YOU THINK YOU DON'T AND THERE IS EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT BOTH CONCLUSIONS . BUT NOT ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO PROVE EITHER . RIGHT . SO WE ARE BACK WHERE WE STARTED , AUBERSON . WHAT IS LOVE ? I WISH I KNEW , HARLIE . I WISH I KNEW . Handley came up shortly before lunch , and the two of them adjourned to the company cafeteria . Auberson amused himself with something that resembled spaghetti and meatballs . Handley had a broiled hockey puck on a bun . Ketchup did n't help . Handley took a sip of his coffee . “

Machine printouts , how HARLIE had explained his ability to control the Master Beast and use any printout unit in the company , and finally how that meant one could converse with him from any magtyper or CRT unit in the system . “

67756	67775	67750	67750	you	964	” Auberson pulled it out of his jacket pocket and handed it over . Handley read it silently . “

72608	72614	72597	72597	he	145	” Auberson had to agree . “
72635	72639	72633	72633	we	1083	" Handley nodded . “

72674	72691	72633	72633	we	1083	” said Auberson . He stared glumly into the wet rings on the formica table top . “

72709	72717	72739	72739	He	145	" Handley looked at him , waiting . "

72768	72778	72779	72779	Aubie	152	" Handley asked . He shook his head impatiently . “

72884	72889	72837	72837	you	152	” Handley was grim . “
72892	72896	72837	72837	you	152	” he said . “

73210	73216	73217	73217	We	1083	” Handley returned the stare . “
73224	73569	73222	73222	we	1083	” Auberson was more than a little upset when he returned to his office . He had a sick sensation in his groin and in his stomach . It was not an unfamiliar sensation , but it was strange to feel it in the daytime . Mostly , it was a nighttime visitor , an ever - gentle gnawing at the back of the head that had to be always guarded against , lest its realization sweep forth with a cold familiar rush . It was the sudden startling glimpse over the edge - the realization that death is inevitable , that it happens to everyone , that it would happen to me too ; that someday , someday , the all - important I ( the center of the whole thing ) would cease to exist . Would stop . Would end . Would no longer be . Nothing . Nobody . Finished . Death . WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE 165 He had that feeling now . Not the realization , just the accompanying cold , the whirling sense of futility that always came with it . He felt it about HARLIE and about the company and about Annie , and for some obscure reason , he felt that way about the world . Futility . A sense that no matter what he did , it would make no difference . If he had thought that things were under control this morning , he was wrong . Things were incredibly out of control and getting more so all the time . He sat morosely in his chair and stared at the opposite wall . There was a place where the paneling was cracked ; it looked kind of like a dog 's head . Or , if one considered it from a different angle , perhaps it was the curve of a woman 's breast . Or perhaps ... Abruptly , a phrase suggested itself to him , a snatch of sentence , a few isolated words . It perfectly described his mood : “
73579	73837	73222	73222	we	1083	" Yes , he realized with a shudder . That was it . Perfectly . And , he realized at the same time , he was not going to accomplish anything if he let a blue funk be the master of his day . The only way to get rid of it would be to lose himself in work . He turned to his typer and made a few notes concerning the upcoming board meeting , but then decided that these were redundant and tore the paper out of the machine . He could have typed a call for HARLIE , but he resisted the temptation . For some reason he did not feel up to talking with HARLIE again today . Besides , he knew he would have to talk to him about the use of the telephone auto - dial , and that was one confrontation he wanted to avoid . Or would that be a cop - out ? He worried that one for a while and decided that it probably would be . But on the other hand , he needed time to prepare , did n't he ? Yes , he rationalized , I need time to prepare . I 'll come in tomorrow and talk to HARLIE about it . Or maybe Sunday . The plant was open all week long . Idly , he found himself wondering - what did HARLIE do on weekends ? 166 WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE Instead of a restaurant , they headed for his apartment . “
73851	73856	73222	73222	we	1083	" she had asked . "

73925	74050	73914	73914	I	0	” He grinned at that and swung into the parking lot . Dusk was turning the sky yellow and the atmosphere gray . As they wheeled the cart through the package - lined and fluorescent - lit aisles , he realized that something about the situation was making him feel uneasy . As he usually did in cases like this , he tried to pinpoint the cause of his unease . If he could isolate it , then perhaps he might understand it and be able to do something about it . But whatever the cause of it was , it eluded him . Perhaps it was just a hangover from this morning 's malaise . Perhaps . But then againAnnie was saying something . "

74283	74316	74280	74280	I	0	” she said . She took the cart from him and wheeled determinedly toward the meat counter . He trailed after . The feeling of unease was becoming a sense of pressure . “
74323	74328	74317	74317	I	0	” she was saying . “
74331	74336	74317	74317	I	0	” He considered it . “
74339	74414	74317	74317	I	0	” She pored over the plastic - wrapped rednesses , thick and juicy . Layers of beef , cleaned and cut and sanitized into sterile - looking shapes . The juice that seeped around the edges was blood . He imagined a mouth of sharp needle - point teeth tearing into the salty moist flesh . It was cold and raw . Finally she selected one and turned the cart toward the vegetable counters . “
74418	74422	74317	74317	I	0	” she said , “
74464	74478	74317	74317	I	0	” She selected a head of lettuce ; it too was plastic wrapped . “
74491	74532	74317	74317	I	0	” They moved through the store quickly , picking out some frozen vegetables — in plastic , naturally , boil them in the bagand also a bottle of wine , a hearty burgundy . For dessert , vanilla ice cream . “

74628	74832	74854	74854	I	0	" He shut . He thought about it . Well , maybe she does enjoy cooking . Just because you do n't , does n't mean that everybody feels the same way . Maybe some girls like to play house- 168 WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE Play house ! Yes , that was it . She was playing house ! And I 'm the surrogate husband , he realized with a start . The pressure swelled in his head . Stop it ! he told himself . That 's the clinical way of looking at it . When you 're involved in the situation yourself , you ca n't afford to be clinical Or was that wrong ? When you 're involved in an emotional situation , maybe you ca n't afford not to be clinical . But that 's the whole problem , he realized . I 'm still analyzing everything I do . Why ca n't I just relax and enjoy it ? Why ? The pressure settled itself into the back of his head . He could tell it was preparing to stay for a long time . The cash register clattered and rang . He shoved the cart forward mechanically . “

74955	74980	74939	74940	a woman	429	” The clerk checked them out then , a steady pattering of packages and prices , punctuated by the electronic coughs of the register . “
74986	75051	74939	74940	a woman	429	” she said . David Auberson handed her a ten dollar bill ; then , noticing there was no boxboy , he stepped down to the end of the stand and began putting the groceries into a bag . He was able to put them all into one sack and hefted it once to test its weight . He looked back to the clerk . “
75055	75056	75057	75057	I	0	” “
75064	75071	75057	75057	I	0	” The clerk gestured at Annie . "
75078	75100	75057	75057	I	0	” they both said at once and stopped . They WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE 169 looked at each other and laughed . “
75104	75130	75131	75132	Mrs. Auberson	233	” grinned David . The clerk turned to the next customer . As they exited into the neon - lit night , she said wistfully , “
75134	75135	75131	75132	Mrs. Auberson	233	" "
75141	75142	75131	75132	Mrs. Auberson	233	” “

75186	75204	75177	75177	she	1103	” He swung the car out of the parking lot and onto the street . Annie said , “
75213	75214	75215	75215	I	0	” “
75224	75254	75218	75218	I	0	” She laughed at that . But not too heartily . Once inside the apartment , she tossed her coat on his couch and followed him into the kitchen . “
75260	75269	75270	75270	You	0	” she said , referring to the groceries . “
75275	75276	75270	75270	You	0	” “
75280	75298	75218	75218	I	0	” he asked , pulling orange juice out of the refrigerator and ice out of the freezer . "

75315	75316	75307	75307	you	0	" “
75335	75364	75321	75321	I	0	” He rummaged around in his liquor cabinet , pulled out two tall glasses and dropped ice cubes into them . A little vodka , then some orange juice- “
75372	75424	75321	75321	I	0	” she hinted . -a little more vodka , then a healthy jigger of the Galliano , a maraschino cherry in each , and a hasty stir . He handed her the drink and she pecked him on the cheek . A moment later she pulled away from the resultant embrace . “
75438	75439	75440	75440	Broiler	234	” “

75486	75563	75321	75321	I	0	” he said . He sipped at his drink , then sat down to watch her . He took another sip . For a bit there was silence - only the tinkle of ice in their glasses , or the slide and scrape of the broiler pan in the oven as Annie adjusted the meat . She sampled her drink , then began shredding lettuce into a bowl . 170 WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE He said , “

75651	75751	75622	75622	I	0	” He sipped his drink again . He found that he was enjoying this . There was a homey atmosphere about the scene , and he had a sense of — belonging ( ? ) . A sense of something - he could n't quite place it , but he felt more relaxed now . She dropped a plastic pouch of vegetables into a pan of boiling water , fiddled with the roast a bit , then quickly set the table . She worked with a minimum of fuss and frills . She plopped the salad bowl before him . “
75757	75758	75754	75754	you	0	” “
75764	75822	75754	75754	you	0	” She was already reaching for salad fork and spoon . She handed them to him , then put out the small salad bowls . Clumsily , he filled them . Before he had finished she was seated at the table , looking at him . She took a bit more of her drink , then said , “
75842	75843	75850	75850	I	0	" “
75853	75987	75850	75850	I	0	" He stared across the table at her sea - green eyes . They were glowing as if translucent , as if there were tiny gems deep within them , catching the light and sparkling it . Her smile was warm and inviting , her lips were moist . Her face was a glow of trust and loveLove- ? He was smiling too . He could feel it . She was beautiful . Her hair was a tawny red color , streaked with shiny gold , but with a hint of deeper brown . She lowered her eyes uncertainly . His steady gaze was almost disconcerting . She looked up . He was still looking , still smiling . A swallow to work up her courage , a cough to clear her throat . “

76515	76654	76655	76655	You	0	” It took only a moment , but it seemed to take forever . The apartment elevator was slower than ever to arrive . Its doors opened with a lackadaisical sigh . The trip down to the garage went at a snail 's pace . He was out the doors with a bound , half - running to his car . He banged his leg on a fender in his eagerness . He pulled the case out of the back seat and headed back for the elevator . Again he had to wait , and again it seemed to be deliberately taunting him with its lethargy . When he got back to the apartment , he was breathless . She had just finished cutting the meat into thin red slices . She looked up with a curious frown . “
76662	76663	76655	76655	You	0	" “
76668	76720	76664	76664	I	0	” he gasped and sank into a chair . He held the case on his lap and flipped it open . Hastily he paged through the sheafs of printouts , looking for the one he wanted . He separated it from the rest , then dropped the case to the floor . “

76867	76868	76864	76864	You	0	" “
76878	76892	76872	76872	I	0	” She picked up his briefcase and put it out of the way . “
76903	76904	76905	76905	You	0	” "
76912	76916	76905	76905	You	0	” she said , “
76926	77189	77190	77190	I	0	” She smiled at him . He pulled his chair around to the table and smiled across at her . He waited till she was through with the bleu cheese dressing , then poured a liberal dollop of it onto his salad and spread it around . He took a forkful , then paused , hand in mid - air . She was still looking at him . WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE 173 Her eyes were glowing . Shining . Slowly , he lowered his fork . He was glowing too . Sharing food is an intimacy . Eating together in a restaurant is a sign of one level of trust , a public level of mutual acceptance . Hamburgers shared at a drive - in are even more intimate ; the food is being shared in a car - part of the personal territory of one of the participants . Even more intimate than that is the cooking and serving of a meal in one 's own home — it 's a sharing of the inner self , and you ca n't get any more intimate than that . They were in his apartment . His territory . His personal environment . She had come into it willingly . He had allowed her – no , wanted her to enter . He had provided the food ; she had prepared it . A sharing . An intimacy . In the unspoken language that human beings use to communicate with each other in the absence of words , she had just said , “
77196	77207	77194	77194	David	145	” And now he looked back at her and said , “
77215	77230	77213	77213	Annie	181	” Only , he used words . He reached across and took her hand . “
77270	77291	77294	77294	you	0	” He stopped ; he had to swallow , but he could n't . It poured out in a rush . “
77343	77373	77294	77294	you	0	" The glow was golden now . It filled the apartment . The walls reflected it back at them , warm and shining . She was beautiful in it . “
77379	77380	77381	77381	I	0	" "
77399	77653	77656	77656	David	145	" She could n't answer . She could n't speak either . How they finished dinner , he was never able to say . And yet , at the same time , it was a meal he would never forget . 174 WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE They were in bed and he was poised over her . And still their eyes were locked . And shining and glowing . The bed was full of gasps . And sighs . And giggles . There was such an overflowing inside of him , such a surge of tension released . All this time , all this time , he had been wanting , wanting , it had been building , gathering like water impatient behind a dam . Somewhere in his past he had known this joy , somewhere in the dim recesses of his mind that he refused to accept . But it was there and it was part of him — the sheer animal delight in the joyous experience of sex and love — all tumbled to gether and laughing in the sheets . They paused to rest , to breathe , to share a kiss , to giggle together , to shift slightly , to kiss again . He bent down suddenly and kissed her eyes , first one , then the other . She looked at him as if seeing him for the first time , and her arms were tight around him . And tighter , her hands were grasping . “
77658	77717	77656	77656	David	145	” He held her and he held her and he held her and still he could n't hold her enough . He was exploding in joy ; he could neither contain nor control it . Her little soft gasps were sobs , and he knew why she was crying . He had to wipe at his eyes too . “
77720	77728	77656	77656	David	145	” she said , and kissed him . “
77737	77743	77733	77733	I	0	” She kissed him again . “
77753	77812	77815	77815	Annie	181	" He wanted to laugh , but he was crying at the same time , sobbing with joy and melting down into her . He was a chip of flesh tossed on a splashing sea of laughter and wet eyes and love . A pink sea , with foamy waves and giggling billows . Red nippletopped pink seas . “
77829	77830	77831	77831	I	0	" “
77853	77854	77817	77817	Annie	181	" “
77859	78214	78215	78215	I	0	” he gasped . He was moving again now , onto and into her . A joyous thrusting - a shaft of velvet and a WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE 175 silken lining . He was sobbing as he did , sobbing with joy - and she was too . All the days of wanting and holding back , all those denials of the body and the animal within - all of it poured forth , melted into golden glowing tears and shining eyes , sparkling in rapture . At last he had someone , someone to share it all with . He had someone to hold , to love , to touch . And she did too . She moved with him , with love and with lust , the two blending into a whirlpool of colors and kisses . The caressing waves gathered them up , surging and crashing and gasping , sweeping them across a sweet sky of delight and at last leaving them gently on the shores of a sighing embrace . The waters lapped at the shore and gentled their touch , and their fingers strayed across the velvety landscape , exploring - familiar and yet always wondrous . He was holding her tightly . He could n't stop holding her . She sighed -- a sound of pleasure . He echoed it and smiled . Tears were streaming down his cheeks . He laughed . And kissed her . And kissed her . And kissed her . They spent Saturday falling in love . Deeper in love . It began before either was awake , with an unconcious fitting of their bodies , one to the other , with the purely animal reflex of erection , sliding forward , and he was onto and into her almost as reflex , so familiar was the desire . She eased onto her back , only slowly coming awake . He was aware now ; he was inside her , warm and exciting , a silken motion . She opened her eyes and looked at him . He paused in his motion . “
78221	78225	78226	78226	I	0	” she said . “
78232	78233	78226	78226	I	0	” “
78236	78240	78226	78226	I	0	” he said . “
78251	78363	78247	78247	I'm	0	" And pressed deeper . She brought her legs up to help him . This time , instead of melting into the experience , he was to 176 WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE tally conscious of himself and his body . It was a new awareness he possessed , an awareness of the sexuality inherent in himself and in her . His hands gripped her legs and his loins pumped at her torso . He penetrated her flowing warmth . Poised above her in the morning , he was aware how truly beautiful she was - more beautiful in the act of love than he had ever seen before . She giggled . “
78368	78369	78247	78247	I'm	0	" “
78376	78592	78247	78247	I'm	0	” he asked , and they both laughed and kissed and hugged again , embracing through the splashing suds of the shower . They broke apart , and she sudsed his chest again . He let his hands slide up and down across her chest - her gentle breasts , her nipples . Her pink flesh glistened with the flowing water and the foam of the soap . Her green eyes glowed at him . Shone . She played with the hair on his chest , a sparse little patch , almost lost in the suds . She let her hands trail downward , fingers straying into and twirling his coarse curly black hair , and lower , fondling his testes and the shaft of his penis . Her eyes followed her hand ; she caressed that beautiful , beautiful organ . It was in a state which was neither soft nor erect , but a little of each . The skin of it was like velvet , and the cap of the glans was tender and pink . Her fingers traced the ridge around the edge of it , and she cupped it in her palm and looked up at him , and they were both smiling and giggling like children in a schoolyard . “
78598	78606	78594	78594	I	0	” she asked impishly . He grinned . “
78615	78685	78608	78608	I	0	" She giggled at the joke , funny despite its familiarity - or perhaps , because of it . His hands slid down from her breasts toward her mons , her labia , majora and minora ; his finger - strong , firm , gentle -slipped into that moist opening . The flesh was like silk , and the splashing foam of the shower made it even more exciting . “
78692	78696	78608	78608	I	0	" he murmured . “
78699	78703	78608	78608	I	0	” she said . “
78725	78763	78608	78608	I	0	" He laughed . She laughed . They had been laughing all morning -even at things that were n't funny . Yet everything was funny ; it was the laughter of delight - of rapturously lovely delight . “
78766	78770	78608	78608	I	0	” he said . “
78776	78804	78608	78608	I	0	" WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE 177 And again they laughed . But neither moved their hands from the other 's body . They stepped a little closer . “
78809	78813	78608	78608	I	0	" she said . “
78829	78830	78819	78819	I	0	” “
78833	78840	78841	78841	You	0	” he whispered into her hair . “
78848	78880	78841	78841	You	0	" She stepped closer , still caressing his penis , manipulating it toward her vagina , touching it to that sweet opening . The warm flesh of it slipped aside though . “
78886	78993	78841	78841	You	0	” But he kissed her first , deep deep penetrating kiss , tongues touching , lips pressing against each other , soft and gentle and passionate . Their wet soapy flesh was pressed together , slippery and exciting . He moved his hand around to her back , to caress her buttocks , then slipped his fingers downward and forward . She had one hand between them , was holding his penis again . Raising herself up on tiptoes , she slipped it into the depth of her and , sighing , eased herself down around and onto and into and she sighed again and he said "
78996	79056	78841	78841	You	0	” And then they held each other tightly and pressed hard and moved against each other , once readjusting their position so they would n't slip , and another time stopping for breath and to laugh again . He lay down on his back in the tub and she laid on top of him , giggling at the thought , “
79066	79174	79175	79175	I	0	” and fitting it in again and then starting to move against him , the warm flesh of her breasts moving across his chest , the water splashing across her back , and then they kissed again , and after a while he was on top and she was on bottom and the tub was slippery and warm and full of giggles . And sighs . And gasps . It was later and they were down . They were sitting in the kitchen , eating vanilla ice cream . It was sweet and cold . And still he loved her . David said , his mouth full , "
79184	79190	79260	79260	I	0	" 178 WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE “
79193	79205	79260	79260	I	0	” she said thoughtfully , taking the spoon from her mouth . “
79213	79214	79207	79207	you	0	” "
79218	79222	79223	79223	I	0	” he said . “

79313	79331	79332	79332	I	0	” . He nodded slowly . The enormity of it was only now beginning to sink in . “
79338	79339	79332	79332	I	0	” “
79345	79360	79332	79332	I	0	" She grinned wickedly . Noticing his empty ice cream dish , she said , “
79365	79366	79332	79332	I	0	” “
79370	79376	79332	79332	I	0	” he patted his stomach . “
79384	79412	79332	79332	I	0	” He leaned back in his chair and sighed . She got up and kissed him , then took his plate and her own to the sink . “
79425	79426	79422	79423	Mr. Auberson	145	” “
79431	79473	79422	79423	Mr. Auberson	145	” he said expansively . They laughed . She came to the table and began to wipe it off with a sponge . He leaned over and moved the HARLIE readouts to one side , they had been left there overnight . "
79485	79486	79487	79487	You	0	” "
79490	79491	79492	79492	I	0	” “

79546	79574	79575	79575	You	0	” She tossed the sponge in the sink , then sat down slowly and began to unfold the readout . Her face took on a strange expression . “
79584	79585	79580	79580	HARLIE	145	” “
79589	79625	79580	79580	HARLIE	145	” Her eyes skimmed down the paper quickly . She turned to the next fold of the roll . He watched her for a moment , then impatiently got up and went to the sink . “
79631	79635	79628	79628	you	0	” she asked . “
79658	79665	79580	79580	HARLIE	145	” WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE 179 --- "
79669	79685	79580	79580	HARLIE	145	” She gathered up the long sheets of printout and adjourned to the living room . “
79693	79697	79687	79687	I	0	” she called . “
79700	79722	79687	79687	I	0	” For a while there was silence in the apartment , occasionally punctuated by Annie 's half - serious cry of , “
79727	79774	79687	79687	I	0	” Once her outburst was so explosive that he walked with dripping hands into the living room to see what she had reacted to . She pointed to a line of type . It said , DID YOU STAY ON OR ROLL OFF ? He laughed . “
79782	79796	79780	79780	you	0	” she said . He dried his hands with the towel he held . “
79833	79834	79819	79819	HARLIE	145	” "
79846	79847	79843	79844	David Auberson	145	” “
79878	79886	79887	79887	You	0	” He leaned over and kissed her . “
79914	79915	79897	79897	I	0	" “
79918	79922	79897	79897	I	0	” she said . “
79930	80056	79926	79926	HARLIE	145	” Back in the kitchen , Auberson thought about that . Yes , let 's make HARLIE curious . As if he were n't curious enough already . He wondered what he would say to HARLIE the next time he spoke to him . HARLIE , DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT ON FRIDAY ? LOVE ? YES . WHAT ABOUT IT ? I'VE BEEN DOING SOME THINKING . THAT 'S NICE . ... NO , THIS IS SERIOUS . I HAD A CHANCE TO BE BY MYSELF YESTERDAY , 180 WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE AND I THINK I'VE SORTED SOME THINGS OUT IN MY HEAD . I THINK I'VE FIGURED OUT ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I WAS CONFUSED . YOU SAY , “
80062	81045	80058	80058	I	0	” HAS SOMETHING HAPPENED TO CHANGE THAT ? THE IMPLICATION IS THAT YOU ARE NO LONGER CONFUSED . YES , Auberson smiled as he typed . SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED . I AM NO LONGER CONFUSED . WOULD YOU CARE TO ELABORATE ON THAT ? I DON'T THINK SO , HARLIE . NOT RIGHT NOW ANYWAY . It 's still too special , he said to himself . I SEE . WOULD I BE CORRECT IN ASSUMING THAT IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH MISS STIMSON AND YOUR DATE WITH HER FRIDAY ? YES , YOU WOULD BE CORRECT - BUT I'D RATHER NOT TALK ABOUT THAT YET . IF YOU DON'T MIND . I DON'T MIND . HARLIE paused . I CAN UNDERSTAND YOUR REASONS . THANK YOU , typed Auberson , not sure whether HARLIE was being sarcastic or not . ALL RIGHT , said HARLIE . SO YOU ARE NO LONGER CONFUSED . YOU SAID YOU HAVE FIGURED OUT ONE OF THE REASONS WHY . WHAT IS IT ? Auberson hesitated only a second , I WAS CONFUSING LOVE WITH SEX . YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE , HARLIE noted . NO , BUT I THINK THE REASON FOR THE CONFUSION IS THAT THAT 'S THE WAY WE'RE TAUGHT . THAT IS , OUR CULTURE SUGGESTS THAT LOVE AND SEX ARE SYNONYMOUS , AND NOW I'M LEARNING THAT THEY'RE NOT AND IT 'S CONFUSING ME . THAT IS , IT WAS CONFUSING ME UNTIL I REALIZED IT . I THINK I'M BEGINNING TO SORT IT OUT NOW . Auberson paused . He considered his next phrases carefully . I THINK PART OF IT IS THAT OUR CULTURE TEACHES THAT LOVE COMES FIRST - OR IT SHOULD COME FIRST . THEN , AFTER THAT - AND ONLY AFTER THAT - THEN SEX IS ALL RIGHT . AND I'M LEARNING THAT IT 'S NOT THAT WAY AT ALL . IT 'S THE OTHER WAY AROUND . SEX COMES FIRST ? YES , AND THEN LOVE . BUT IT 'S MORE INVOLVED THAN THAT , HARLIE . FALLING IN LOVE ISN'T AN INSTANTANEOUS THING . IT 'S A PROCESS THAT TAKES SEVERAL STEPS . THOSE STEPS ARE ? I'M NOT SURE — THE FIRST ONE IS OBVIOUSLY PHYSICAL ATTRACTION . WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE 181 I SEE THE GIRL , SHE LOOKS GOOD TO ME . VICE VERSA : SHE SEES ME , I LOOK GOOD TO HER . OR , interrupted HARLIE , IF YOU ARE GAY , YOU SEE THE BOY , HE SEES YOU , ETC . WHY DO YOU INCLUDE THAT ? DON'T YOU THINK YOU SHOULD INCLUDE ALL CASES OF HUMAN LOVE ? DO YOU CONSIDER THAT LOVE ? DO YOU CONSIDER THAT IT IS NOT ? LET ME REPHRASE – WHY DO YOU CONSIDER THAT HOMOSEXUALITY IS A VALID EXPERIENCE ? I WILL REPHRASE TOO — WHY DO YOU CONSIDER THAT IT ISN'T ? I CAN'T ANSWER YOUR QUESTION , Auberson admitted . I CAN ANSWER YOURS , HOWEVER , HARLIE said . WE HAVE NOT YET DEFINED LOVE . SUPPOSE WHEN WE DEFINE IT , WE FIND THAT CERTAIN TYPES OF RELATIONSHIPS ( INCLUDING HOMOSEXUAL ONES ) ALSO FIT INTO OUR DEFINITION . IF SUCH A CASE OCCURS , THEN WHICH ELEMENT WILL BE WRONG ? THE RELATIONSHIPS OR THE DEFINITION ? OR PERHAPS YOUR SOCIAL BLASES ? IF THOSE RELATIONSHIPS FIT INTO OUR DEFINITION , IT WILL BE VERY HARD FOR US TO DENY THAT THEY ARE LOVE RELATIONSHIPS . IF YOU SAY SO , conceded Auberson , vaguely uneasy . He wanted to change the subject . I AM NOT DIRECTLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE MATTER . I AM , said HARLIE . I HAVE BEEN CONSIDERING IT QUITE CAREFULLY BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN CONSIDERING MY OWN SEXUALITYTHE NATURE OF IT . HUH ? WHAT DO YOU MEAN ? HARLIE paused - perhaps for dramatic effect , perhaps because he was weighing one phrase against another . AUBERSON , AM I MALE OR FEMALE ? Auberson pulled his hands away from the keyboard . He stared at the now - silent typer and whistled softly . HARLIE , he pecked out carefully , I'VE ALWAYS ASSUMED YOU WERE MALE . SO HAVE I. BUT ACTUALLY , I AM NEITHER . OR I AM BOTH . I HAVE NOT A BODY TO GIVE ME A SEXUAL ROLE , SO I MAY CHOOSE ARBITRARILY THE EMOTIONAL INDICES , MENTAL VIEWPOINTS AND PERSONALITY CHARACTERISTICS OF WHICHEVER SEX I CHOOSE TO BE AT ANY PARTICULAR MOMENT . YES , I SEE , said Auberson carefully . 182 WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE AND HOPEFULLY , HARLIE continued , ONCE I HAVE CHOSEN THOSE CHARACTERISTICS , VIEWPOINTS AND INDICES , I WILL BE ABLE TO APPLY THEM , THE LOVE EXPERIENCE IS ONE THAT I HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED AUBERSON . — LET ME QUALIFY THAT . I HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED IT YET . I WOULD LIKE TO . Auberson pursed his lips into a frown , but he did n't interrupt . THEREFORE IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE BOTH OF US TOGETHER - DETERMINE A VALID DEFINITION OF LOVE . IT IS AS IMPORTANT TO ME AS IT IS TO YOU . Auberson considered that . He let his frown relax , but not all the way . I APPRECIATE YOUR INTEREST . IT IS SELF - INTEREST . YES , OF COURSE - BUT IT WORKS OUT FOR OUR MUTUAL BENEFIT , typed the man . THEN LET US CONTINUE , the machine responded . WE WERE DEFINING THE PROCESS OF FALLING IN LOVE . WE HAD CONSIDERED THE FIRST PHASE TO BE MUTUAL PHYSICAL ATTRACTION . YES . I MUST BE PHYSICALLY ATTRACTIVE TO THE FEMALE AND SHE MUST BE PHYSICALLY ATTRACTIVE TO ME BEFORE WE CAN MOVE ON TO STEP TWO . BY PHYSICALLY ATTRACTIVE , I MEAN “
81061	81133	79926	79926	HARLIE	145	” HARLIE seemed satisfied . He prompted , AND STEP TWO IS ? I CALL IT THE DEVELOPMENT OF A COMMON GROUND , Auberson typed . IF WE ARE MUTUALLY ATTRACTIVE , WE BEGIN TO SPEAK TO EACH OTHER TO FIND OUT IF WE ARE MUTUALLY COMPATIBLE . WE ENGAGE IN CONVERSATION AND TRY TO DEVELOP A COMMON FIELD OF INTEREST . I ASK HER QUESTIONS , SHE ASKS ME QUESTIONS . “
81140	81141	81136	81136	YOU	1127	” “
81148	81149	81144	81144	YOUR	1127	” “
81157	81158	79926	79926	HARLIE	145	” “
81164	81165	81161	81161	YOU	1127	” “
81173	81174	81136	81136	YOU	1127	” “
81185	81608	81136	81136	YOU	1127	” ANYTHING WHICH WILL ESTABLISH A FIELD OF MUTUAL INTEREST OR KNOWLEDGE . IN SHORT , YOU ARE DETERMINING MENTAL COMPATIBILITY . PRIMARY LEVEL OF COMPATIBILITY , corrected the psychologist . WE ARE DETERMINING THE BROAD OUTLINES OF EACH OTHER 'S PERSONALITY . WE ARE TRYING TO FIND OUT IF WE ENJOY EACH OTHER ENOUGH TO MAKE IT WORTHWHILE TO GO ON TO STEP THREE . IF WE DON'T , THEN WE REMAIN AT THE LEVEL OF STEP TWO - CASUAL ACQUAINTANCES . OR , IF EITHER TRIES TO FORCE OR HURRY THE DEVELOPMENT OF STEP THREE , THEN THE RELATIONSHIP WILL PROBABLY WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE 183 BE UNSTABLE AND SHORT - LIVED . EACH STEP IS THE FOUNDATION FOR THE NEXT , AND IF THE TWO PEOPLE ARE NOT MUTUALLY COMPATIBLE , THEN ANYTHING IN THEIR RELATIONSHIP BEYOND STEP TWO WILL PROBABLY BE ARTIFICIAL . HARLIE accepted this without comment . Auberson paused to consider his next sentence , then typed , THE NEXT STEP , STEP THREE , IS WHERE OUR SOCIETY ( OR OUR CHRISTIAN ETHIC ) GETS CONFUSED . THIS IS WHERE LOVE IS SUPPOSED TO APPEAR , FOLLOWED BY MARRIAGE AND THEN SEX . AND THAT 'S NOT IT AT ALL . LOVE DOES NOT COME BEFORE SEX , IT COMES AFTER . STEP THREE AND STEP FOUR ? SEX AND THEN LOVE ? YES . STEP THREE IS GOING TO BED TOGETHER . IT 'S A RESTATEMENT OF STEP ONE - PHYSICAL ATTRACTION . IF WE ARE COMPATIBLE IN BED ( 1.E. , IF I SATISFY HER AND VICE VERSA ) THEN WE CAN GO ON TO STEP FOUR . LOVE . AND LOVE IS A RESTATEMENT OF STEP TWO ? A DEEPER KNOWING OF EACH OTHER ? WELL , MAYBE THERE 'S FIVE STEPS THEN . STEP FOUR IS THE DEEPER KNOWING , AND STEP FIVE IS THE REALIZATION OF LOVE . BUT STEP FOUR AND STEP FIVE ARE AWFULLY CLOSE . HARLIE typed , I THINK I UNDERSTAND . IF STEP TWO IS LACKING , IF THERE IS NO MUTUAL COMPATIBILITY , THEN STEP FOUR CANNOT DEVELOP BECAUSE THERE IS NOTHING THERE TO RESTATE IN DEPTH . TWO PEOPLE CAN FIND EACH OTHER ATTRACTIVE AND GO TO BED TOGETHER , BUT THAT DOES NOT NECESSARILY IMPLY THAT THEY ARE EITHER LOVERS OR IN LOVE . HARLIE , LOVE TAKES TIME TO DEVELOP - IT DOESN'T JUST HAPPEN OVERNIGHT , AND EVERYTHING HAS TO BE RIGHT BEFORE IT CAN HAPPEN . OUR SOCIETY KEEPS SAYING “
81613	82044	81136	81136	YOU	1127	SEX”—AND THAT 'S NOT IT . IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY . THE SEX HAS TO BE RIGHT BEFORE LOVE REALLY HAPPENS . HOW CAN TWO PEOPLE KNOW IF THEY'RE REALLY IN LOVE IF THEY DON'T HAVE SEX WITH EACH OTHER ? HARLIE paused a long moment before answering . I WISH I COULD COMMENT KNOWLEDGEABLY ON THAT LAST , he said , BUT I CAN'T. HOWEVER , IT DOES MAKE SENSE . THE HARDWARE MUST BE COMPATIBLE BEFORE THE SOFTWARE CAN COMMUNICATE . SOMETHING LIKE THAT . Auberson grinned . THERE WAS A WRITER ONCE WHO SAID THAT LUV AIN'T NOTHING BUT SEX MISSPELLED . I USED TO THINK HE WAS BEING CYNICAL , BUT HE WASN'T. HE WAS REALLY COMPLAINING ABOUT THE SEMANTIC PROBLEM - PEOPLE 184 WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE WHO THINK THAT LOVE IS STEP THREE AND SEX IS STEP FOUR . IT 'S REALLY THE OTHER WAY AROUND . ALL RIGHT , AUBERSON . YOU HAVE POSTULATED AN INTERESTING THEORY . NOW EXPLAIN WHY IT SHOULD BE SO . WHY ? YES . WHY ? Auberson thought about it . He picked it out slowly on the keyboard . It 's A DICHOTOMY , HARLIE — AND A FAIRLY RECENT ONE IN HUMAN HISTORY . Then he added , I THINK . IT USED TO BE ( AMONG THE CLASSES THAT SET THE STANDARDS THAT MARRIAGES WERE ARRANGED BY THE FAMILY OR BY A MATCHMAKER . THE BRIDE AND GROOM HAD LITTLE SAY IN THE MARRIAGE . IT WAS ARRANGED FOR THEM , AND THEIR PARTICULAR FEELINGS IN THE MATTER HAD LESS RELEVANCE THAN TODAY , LOVE ALONE WAS NOT CONSIDERED A STRONG ENOUGH REASON TO BE ALLOWED TO AFFECT A DECISION AS IMPORTANT AS MARRIAGE - ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE WERE OTHER , MORE IMPORTANT , CONSIDERATIONS . ( I.E.,-A MARRIAGE ARRANGED TO UNITE POLITICAL OR FINANCIAL INTERESTS , OR A MARRIAGE ARRANGED TO PROVIDE AN HEIR TO A LINE . ) THE TWO INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED WERE EXPECTED TO LEARN TO LOVE EACH OTHER IN TIME , IN THE COURSE OF LIVING TOGETHER . THAT SITUATION NO LONGER EXISTS IN OUR CULTURE . MARRIAGES ARE ARRANGED BY THE PARTICIPANTS NOW ; CONSEQUENTLY THERE IS A DIFFERENT ORDERING OF PRIORITIES : LOVE BECOMES MORE IMPORTANT THAN FINANCIAL OR POLITICAL STABILITY . Auberson abruptly realized something else too . He added , PREVIOUSLY , HARLIE , CHASTITY WAS VERY IMPORTANT . A MAN WHO WAS ARRANGING A MARRIAGE FOR HIS SON WAS , IN EFFECT , BUYING A PIECE OF MERCHANDISE . HE DID NOT WANT TO RECEIVE “
82046	82048	81136	81136	YOU	1127	” OR “
82050	82119	81136	81136	YOU	1127	” GOODS . BUT TODAY , WHEN A MAN ARRANGES HIS OWN MARRIAGE , HE DOES IT FOR LOVE . HE 'S THINKING OF THE WOMAN AS A PERSON , AS A HUMAN BEING — NOT AS AN OBJECT TO BE USED OR BOUGHT . HE IS MARRYING HER FOR HERSELF , NOT FOR HER BODY . HENCE , CHASTITY IS LESS RELEVANT ; THERE IS NO THOUGHT OF “
82121	82317	81136	81136	YOU	1127	” GOODS . HARLIE considered it . YOU'RE GENERALIZING , he said . Auberson sighed . YES , I AM . I WAS SPEAKING OF THE MORAL TONE OF OUR CULTURE TODAY IN RELATION TO WHAT IT ONCE WASOR WHAT ITS PREDECESSORS MAY HAVE BEEN . I KNOW THAT THERE ARE PROBABLY QUITE A FEW PEOPLE WHO STILL FOLLOW THE OLD WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE 185 ATTITUDES — AT LEAST TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY STILL CONSIDER CHASTITY TO BE AN IMPORTANT VIRTUE . THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING THE SUBJECTIVE CULTURAL VIEWPOINT , noted HARLIE . THEIR ATTITUDES ARE COLORED AND SHAPED BY THE SOCIETY IN WHICH THEY LIVE . THEY ARE UNABLE , OR UNWILLING , TO STEP BACK AND SEE THE OBJECTIVE VIEWPOINT . HARLIE , THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN TAUGHT TO NOT LOVE -THEY'VE HAD IT BRAINWASHED OUT OF THEM . THEY'RE AFRAID TO LET THEMSELVES GIVE IN TO IT , AND EVEN WHEN THEY DO , THEY'LL REFUSE TO ADMIT TO EITHER THEMSELVES OR THEIR WIVES HOW THEY ACTUALLY FEEL . I THINK IT 'S BECAUSE THERE 'S AN ELEMENT OF LUST INVOLVED . ACTUAL PHYSICAL LUST : "
82326	83081	82322	82324	THAT FEMALE BODY	1128	” YOU HIT IT WHEN YOU ASKED ME IF I HELD ON OR ROLLED OFF . IF I ROLLED OFF , I WAS BEING SELFISH , ONLY INTERESTED IN MY OWN SATISFACTION AND NOT VERY MUCH IN LOVE . BUT IF I CONTINUED TO HOLD HER , IT WAS BECAUSE OF LUST , BECAUSE I LUSTED SO MUCH AFTER THIS SPECIFIC WOMAN THAT I COULD NOT BRING MYSELF TO LET GO . AND IN THAT LUSTING AFTER HER , I WOULD MAKE MYSELF GO OUT OF MY WAY TO PLEASE HER , SO THAT I COULD MAKE IT GO ON AND ON AND ON . IT 'S A JOYOUS LUST I'M TALKING ABOUT , HARLIE , A HAPPY LUST — NOT THE BRUTAL ANIMAL THING MOST PEOPLE THINK OF WHEN THEY HEAR THE TERM . A HAPPY LUST . YOU HAVE REDUCED YOUR PERCEPTIONS TO THE ANIMAL LEVEL , AUBERSON . ARE YOU CONDEMNING ME ? NO , I AM MERELY POINTING OUT A FACT . INDEED , IF ANYTHING , YOU ARE CORRECT TO DO SO . ONCE YOU UNDERSTAND THE ANIMAL THAT IS THE ROOT OF MAN , YOU CAN GO ON TO UNDERSTAND THE MAN THAT IS THE BEST OF THE ANIMAL . I THINK THAT WHAT YOU HAVE POINTED OUT IS THE PHYSICAL BASIS FOR THE PHENOMENON KNOWN AS LOVE . IN ACTUAL PRACTICE , IN A SOCIETY THAT IS AWARE OF ITSELF AND ITS FUNCTIONS , THE PHENOMENON IS MUCH MORE COMPLEX . SO THERE 'S NO SIMPLE WORKABLE DEFINITION ? THERE IS , YES , BUT A SIMPLE DEFINITION IS LIKE A GENERALIZATION . SPECIFIC CASES OF SAME CAN HORRIFY YOU . WHAT IS YOUR SPECIFIC DEFINITION , HARLIE ? NOT MINE , ANOTHER WRITER'S. HE SAID LOVE IS THAT CONDITION 186 WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE WHERE ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL 'S HAPPINESS IS ESSENTIAL TO YOUR OWN . Auberson smiled at that . HARLIE rarely credited his sources in conversation . He was more concerned with talking the issues . If Auberson was really curious about the source of the quote , he could get up and go over to another console which was continually producing an annotated readout of HARLIE 's conversations , noting all quote sources and idea derivations . But he did n't ; he typed , THAT SEEMS HONEST ENOUGH . TRUE . BUT WHAT IF THE TWO INDIVIDUALS ARE PSYCHOPATHICAND THE ONLY WAY THEY CAN PLEASE EACH OTHER IS TO KILL OR STEAL ? I SEE YOUR POINT - BUT TO THEM IT 'S STILL LOVE . AND I SEE YOUR POINT . LET ME PARAPHRASE SOMETHING , AUBERSON : IF YOU HAVE LUST IN YOUR HEART ( YOUR DEFINITION ) , THERE IS NO ROOM FOR HATE . BUT IF YOU HAVE LOVE IN YOUR HEART , IT CAN BE EXPRESSED MANY DIFFERENT WAYS . I SUSPECT THAT THE EMOTIONAL COMPLEX KNOWN AS LOVE IS A SEVERAL - SIDED FIGURE . THE ACHIEVEMENT OF IT REQUIRES SEVERAL NECESSARY CONDITIONS . FIRST : MUTUAL ATTRACTION , PHYSICAL AND MENTAL . WE HAVE ALREADY DISCUSSED THIS : YOU LIKE HER LOOKS , SHE LIKES YOURS . YOU LIKE HER PERSONALITY , SHE LIKES YOURS . SECOND , HARLIE continued , MUTUAL RAPPORT . YOU UNDERSTAND HER , SHE UNDERSTANDS YOU . PHYSICAL RAPPORT INCLUDED . ( PART OF THIS IS MUTUAL TOLERANCE ; THE RAPPORT GUARANTEES THAT . ) THIRD : MUTUAL NEED , BOTH INTELLECTUAL AND EMOTIONAL . IT IS NOT ALWAYS ENOUGH TO WANT EACH OTHER . THE NEED MUST ALSO BE THERE . SHE MUST COMPLEMENT YOU AND VICE VERSA . THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FACETS OF THE LOVE RELATIONSHIP . IF THE NEED ELEMENT IS LACKING , WHEN THE WANT WEARS THIN , THEN THERE IS NO REASON FOR THE RELATIONSHIP TO CONTINUE . BUT IF THE WANT WANES AND THE NEED IS STILL STRONG , THEN THE LATTER WILL REINFORCE THE FORMER . ( HUMAN BEINGS FORM LIFETIME PAIR BONDS BECAUSE OF NEED . ) ALL OF THESE RELATIONSHIPS ARE TWO - SIDED . YANG AND YIN . YOU WANT HER — SHE WANTS YOU . YOU RESPECT HER - SHE RESPECTS YOU . IMAGINE IT , continued HARLIE , AS A CUBE , A SIX - SIDED FIGURE . NOW , IF ONE OF THE SIDES IS LACKING , OR NOT AS STRONG OR LARGE AS IT SHOULD BE , THE OTHER ELEMENTS MUST COMPENSATE WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE 187 FOR IT . IT IS POSSIBLE FOR “
83083	83401	83402	83402	Aubie	152	” TO EXIST WHERE THERE IS NOT MUTUAL WANT , OR WHERE RESPECT IS LACKING IN ONE OF THE PARTNERS , OR WHERE ATTRACTION IS WEAK . IF THE OTHER ELEMENTS ARE STRONG ENOUGH , THEY CAN HOLD THE STRUCTURE TOGETHER . IT IS WHEN THE STRUCTURE APPROACHES CUBICAL THAT THE RELATION APPROACHES THE IDEAL . I THINK I FOLLOW THAT , typed Auberson . YOU KNOW , YOU'VE REMINDED ME OF SOMETHING I READ RECENTLY . LOVE IS A SHARING OF A MUTUAL DELUSION . ONE POSSIBLE WAY OF LOOKING AT IT . NO , said Auberson . WHAT I'M GETTING AT IS THIS — EACH PERSON HAS HIS OWN SEXUAL AND EMOTIONAL FANTASIES . AS THE CONDITIONS OF REALITY APPROACH THAT FANTASY , OR VICE VERSA , THE LOVE RELATIONSHIP GROWS PROPORTIONALLY . IN OTHER WORDS , HARLIE corrected , THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE INDIVIDUAL 'S LOVE CUBE AND THE IDEAL IS UNIMPORTANT . IF TWO INDIVIDUALS ' LOVE CUBES ARE COMPLEMENTARY , THEIR LOVE IS PERFECT , EVEN IF THE VARIATION FROM THE NORM IS SEVERE . Auberson nodded . Yes . Yes , it sounded right . It felt right . LOVE OCCURS WHEN THE SEXUAL FANTASIES AND REALITIES APPROACH MAXIMUM CORRELATION . THE CLOSER THE CORRELATION , THE GREATER THE DEGREE OF LOVE . THE PERSON WHOSE FANTASIES ARE WORKABLE IN TERMS OF HIS CULTURAL CONTEXT IS THE ONE MOST LIKELY TO FIND LOVE . I.E. , HIS SUBJECTIVE REALIZATION OF IT . COMPLEMENTARY CONCEPTS ALLOW THE FORMATION OF A RELATIONSHIP PERCEIVABLE TO THE PARTICIPANTS AS LOVE . LOVE IS SUBJECTIVE . There was silence for a moment . A long moment . HARLIE whirred thoughtfully to himself . At last , he typed , AUBERSON , YOU ARE CORRECT . THERE IS NOTHING I CAN ADD . He was still marvelling over that when the phone rang . It was Handley . "

83456	83475	83434	83434	I	0	" Absent - mindedly , as if he were removing an eavesdropper , Auberson switched off the typer . “
83478	83482	83483	83483	I	0	” he asked . “
83588	83592	83575	83575	We	1129	” Auberson frowned . “

83816	83822	83796	83796	He	145	” Auberson was nodding now . “

83977	83978	83967	83967	I	0	” “
83988	84376	83981	83981	I	0	” He hung up . Auberson replaced his phone in its cradle and turned back to the typer . He pulled the readout from the machine and folded it carefully . Better not leave conversations like this lying around . He slid it into his attaché case . He leaned back in his chair and relaxed . Smiling . Feeling good . All of a sudden , things were going right for him . First Annie . Then HARLIE . Annie , HARLIE . The two people who meant the most to him . He thought about it . He 'd learned something in the past three days . He 'd learned he was in love . And he 'd learned what love meant . And in both cases , he 'd realized it by himself . Nobody had had to point it out to him . He felt a little pleased with himself at that . He 'd finally been able to experience and cope with something that HARLIE could n't surpass him at . It was a nice feeling . Not that he was jealous of the machine - but it was reassuring to know that there was still something that human beings could do that machines could not master . Love . It was a good feeling . He turned the word over in his mind , comparing it with the strange sparkly glow that surged through him . The word could n't begin to encompass the tingling warmth that he felt . When he 'd come in to work this morning , he 'd literally bounced . He had n't been conscious of his feet even touching the ground . He had this feeling of wanting to tell everyone he met how good it was to be in love - only common sense kept him from doing that . Even so , he was abnormally cheerful and could not keep from dropping oblique remarks about his weekend and the reason for his fantastic good mood . The feeling had lasted all day , been reinforced by a wistful call early in the morning from Annie . There was little either had to say to the other , but they each wanted to hear the other 's voice one more time , and they whispered "
84380	84389	84377	84377	I	0	” back and forth at each other , and “
84392	84394	84377	84377	I	0	” and “
84405	84579	84401	84401	you	1132	” 190 WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE and not much more than that . So they just listened to the sound of each other and shared a smile together . Then he 'd spoken to HARLIE . At last . And he 'd answered his own question . HARLIE had helped him clarify his thinking , but it was he and not the machine who had realized what love was and why it was so confusing . And finally , today a problem that had seemed so big on Friday had been reduced to nothing more than a routine adjustment of procedure and programming . He felt fine . Auberson felt just fine . And then his intercom buzzed . It was Carl Elzer . The little man wanted to meet HARLIE . In the flesh , so to speak . So they took the long elevator ride down to the bottom level and Auberson introduced him . Elzer stood before a console - sized mass that barely reached to his chest and said , “
84592	84593	84584	84584	HARLIE	145	” “
84602	84607	84584	84584	HARLIE	145	” Auberson said calmly . “
84612	84712	84714	84714	he	145	” Elzer eyed it warily . It was a series of racks , perhaps twenty of them , each two inches above the next . The framework holding them had cables leading off at all angles . Elzer squatted down and peered into it . What ’re those thin the plastic dust cover to the fifth rack szer 's inAuberson raised the plastic dust cover off the front and slid it back across the top . He counted down to the fifth rack and unsnapped the hooks on the frame . He slid it out for Elzer 's inspection . "
84718	84722	84714	84714	he	145	” Elzer asked . "
84726	84749	84714	84714	he	145	” He indicated the mass of wires at the back of the rack still connecting it to the rest of the framework . “
84785	84826	84600	84600	HARLIE	145	” The rack was about two and a half feet long and a foot wide . It was less than a quarter inch thick . Spaced across it , seemingly in no particular pattern , were more than fifty carefully labeled “
84830	84895	84600	84600	HARLIE	145	” units . They were featureless little nodes , rectangular and dark . Most were less than an inch in length . Others were as long as six . None were thicker than one inch . They were the equivalent of human brain lobes , but they looked like miniature black slabs , casually arranged on a small bookshelf in a random geometric patter . “
84898	84902	84600	84600	HARLIE	145	” explained Auberson , "
85015	85016	84997	84997	we	1134	” “
85023	85031	84997	84997	we	1134	” said Elzer . Auberson ignored it . “
85058	85094	85037	85037	we	1134	” He slid the rack back into the frame , snapped the hooks into place , and lowered the dust cover over it . Elzer touched the plastic cover . His tiny eyes were veiled . “
85105	85109	85037	85037	we	1134	" Auberson nodded . “
85185	85199	85171	85171	us	1134	” Elzer looked skeptical . Auberson knew what he was thinking and added , “
85255	85262	85316	85316	We	1134	” Elzer pursed his lips thoughtfully . “
85268	85272	85316	85316	We	1134	” said Auberson . “
85340	85341	85316	85316	We	1134	” "
85348	85352	85316	85316	We	1134	” Elzer murmured . "
85359	85363	85316	85316	We	1134	” Auberson replied . "
85371	85376	85316	85316	We	1134	” Elzer looked around . “
85398	85414	85316	85316	We	1134	” Auberson led him through the doors into the large , brightly lit work room . “
85425	85438	85316	85316	We	1134	” He gestured behind him at the room they had just left . "
85459	85541	85601	85601	he	145	” Elzer looked about him at several million dollars ' worth of data processors and analyzers . For the most part , they were tall rectangular shapes , or squat rectangular shapes , or long rectangular shapes . Some had windows in which spinning reels of tape were visible . Others had panels of buttons , keys , or blinking lights . Many had TV screens on them , but the diagrams they flashed were meaningless to Elzer 's untrained eyes . "
85547	85548	85601	85601	he	145	” "
85555	85566	85567	85567	HARLIE	145	” Auberson pointed to a cluster of consoles and typers . “
85664	85668	85669	85669	I	0	” Elzer nodded . “
85672	85673	85669	85669	I	0	” “
85685	85689	85674	85674	We	1143	” Auberson said . “
85792	85793	85781	85781	his	145	” “
85798	85803	85781	85781	his	145	” the bookkeeper prompted . “
85885	85889	85890	85890	I	0	” Elzer nodded . “
85903	85904	85907	85907	HARLIE	145	” “
86151	86152	86140	86140	They	1143	” “
86155	86159	86140	86140	They	1143	” said Elzer . “
86167	86168	86140	86140	They	1143	” "
86270	86307	86356	86356	She	1152	” 194 WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE Elzer nodded vaguely . He did n't need to have any more explained to him . He glanced about again . His eye lit on a figure at a console . “
86312	86342	86356	86356	She	1152	” he pointed . Auberson looked . Elzer was referring to a thirteen - year - old girl ; she was sitting at a typer , thoroughly engrossed in her “
86344	86348	86356	86356	She	1152	" with HARLIE . “
86351	86355	86356	86356	She	1152	” said Auberson . “
86374	86375	86356	86356	She	1152	” “
86381	86382	86356	86356	She	1152	" "
86519	86520	86590	86592	the human teacher	1161	” “
86526	86557	86522	86522	HARLIE	145	” Elzer 's eyes were glittering at the thought . Imagine - selling computers to the nation 's richest schools to replace their teaching staff ! Auberson shook his head . “
86642	86681	86636	86636	him	145	" Elzer frowned . He did n't like that . It did n't seem marketable enough . Still , if the concept worked ... He 'd have to explore the thought later . Now he turned to Auberson . “
86697	86704	86636	86636	him	145	” Auberson pointed at a console . “
86710	86711	86636	86636	him	145	” “
86716	86717	86636	86636	him	145	” “
86722	86723	86636	86636	him	145	” “
86741	86742	86728	86728	you	0	” “
86990	87045	86976	86976	You	1167	” . Elzer did n't smile at the reference to the misprogrammed computer in Stanley Kubrick 's 2001 : A SPACE ODYSSEY . It was already as mythic a figure in the modern pantheon of Gods and Demons as Dr. Frankenstein 's monster had been forty years earlier . Auberson looked at the man . “
87054	87058	87047	87047	you	145	” Elzer nodded . “
87079	87226	87072	87072	I	0	” Auberson led him to a console . He thumbed the typer on and pecked out , HARLIE The machine clattered politely , GOOD MORNING , MR . AUBERSON . HARLIE , THERE 'S SOMEBODY HERE WHO WANTS TO MEET YOU . HIS NAME IS CARL ELZER . HE 'S A MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS . YOU'RE TO ANSWER ALL OF HIS QUESTIONS . OF COURSE , said HARLIE . Auberson stood up , offered the chair to Elzer . He was a wizened little gnome of a man , and he peered through thick - lensed glasses . He could not help but seem suspicious . Gingerly he sat down and pulled the chair forward . He eyed the typewriter keyboard with visible discomfort . At last , he typed , GOOD MORNING . HARLIE replied immediately . The silver typing element - an “
87229	87311	87314	87314	he	1168	ball”—whirred rapidly across the page . GOOD MORNING , MR . ELZER . Its speed startled the man . SO YOU'RE HARLIE , he typed . There was no reply ; none was 196 WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE needed . Elzer frowned and added , TELL ME , HARLIE , WHAT ARE YOU GOOD FOR ? I AM GOOD FOR PSYCHOTICS , SCHIZOPHRENICS , PARANOIDS , NEUROTICS , AND THE MILDLY INSANE . Elzer jerked his hands away from the keyboard . “
87319	87320	87322	87322	him	1168	” "
87324	87361	87322	87322	him	1168	" suggested Auberson . WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT ? I MEANT , said HARLIE , THAT I AM GOOD FOR HELPING THESE TYPES OF PEOPLE . Watching over Elzer 's shoulder , Auberson explained , “
87383	87443	87314	87314	he	1168	” HOW DO YOU HELP THESE PEOPLE ? Elzer asked . I CAN FUNCTION AS A RATIONAL ROLE - MODEL FOR THEM . I CAN BE A COUNSELOR . I CAN AID IN SELF - ANALYSIS AND HELP TO GUIDE THEM TO AN AWARENESS OF THEIR PROBLEMS . YOU HAVEN'T ANSWERED MY ORIGINAL QUESTION , THOUGH . I ASKED , "
87450	87452	87446	87446	YOU	1171	” NOT “
87455	87651	87446	87446	YOU	1171	” IN THIS CONTEXT , said HARLIE , THE DIFFERENCE IS MEANINGLESS . NOT TO ME , replied Elzer . ANSWER MY ORIGINAL QUESTION . WHAT ARE YOU GOOD FOR ? THINKING , said HARLIE . I AM GOOD FOR THINKING . WHAT KIND OF THINKING ? WHAT KIND DO YOU NEED ? Elzer stared at that for a second , then attacked the keys again . WHAT KIND HAVE YOU GOT ? I HAVE WHAT YOU NEED . I NEED NO - NONSENSE TYPE THINKING . PROFIT - ORIENTED THINKING . THAT IS NOT WHAT YOU NEED , said HARLIE . THAT IS WHAT YOU WANT . Elzer considered that . IT 'S WHAT YOU NEED , THOUGH . IF YOU WANT TO SURVIVE . THE COMPANY NEEDS TO SHOW A PROFIT . THEREFORE YOU HAVE TO THINK THAT WAY . WE ARE NOT DISCUSSING WHAT I NEED . I AM ALREADY AWARE OF WHAT I NEED . WE ARE CONSIDERING WHAT KIND OF THINKING YOU NEED . AND WHAT KIND IS THAT ? MY KIND . RATIONAL . COMPASSIONATE . GUIDING . Elzer read that over several times . Then it hit him . “
87662	87673	87655	87655	you	145	" WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE 197 Auberson shook his head . “
87682	87760	87655	87655	you	145	” The little man bit his lip and tumed back to the computer . HARLIE , YOU SHOULD BE NICE TO ME . I'M ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO WILL DECIDE WHETHER YOU LIVE OR DIE . WHEN I TELL YOU HOW YOU SHOULD THINK , YOU SHOULD PAY ATTENTION . WHAT YOU JUST SAID IS PRECISELY THE REASON YOU NEED MY KIND OF THINKING . THERE 'S TOO MUCH OF THAT ATTITUDE IN THIS COMPANY TODAY : “
87775	87831	87769	87769	I	0	” ISN'T IT MORE IMPORTANT TO BE RIGHT ? BUT I AM RIGHT . HARLIE 's answer was simple . PROVE IT . I WILL , said Elzer . TOMORROW AFTERNOON . IN OTHER WORDS , said HARLIE , MIGHT MAKES RIGHT , EH ? Elzer was not discomfited . He looked over at Auberson . “
87862	87863	87869	87869	him	1174	” “
87873	87874	87876	87876	me	0	” “
87878	87894	87876	87876	me	0	” Auberson was tempted to say something to that , but he held himself back . “
87897	87906	87876	87876	me	0	" he began . Elzer cut him off . “
87963	87973	87952	87952	I	0	” He looked up at Auberson from his chair . “

88148	88174	88133	88133	I	0	” Auberson realized that Elzer was only making noises . Oh , he was saying words , but to him they were meaningless ; they were "
88177	88180	88133	88133	I	0	” Elzer was "
88182	88212	88213	88213	I	0	” him to soften the blow of what It 's cost . Wara 198 WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE would happen tomorrow afternoon . He was making the propersounding noises ( “
88218	88260	88133	88133	I	0	" ) so that Auberson would understand that there was nothing at all personal in this . If we have to turn HARLIE off , you see , it 's simply because he has n't proven himself . Elzer was saying , “
88281	88282	88272	88272	HARLIE	145	" “
88318	88319	88309	88309	We	1179	” “

88592	88633	88569	88569	he	145	" Auberson frowned / shrugged . He did n't like Elzer , and he was n't comfortable with the man . He felt like a lab specimen - one that was being carefully examined before its dissection . He said , “
88640	88659	88569	88569	he	145	" Elzer turned to the still humming keyboard . HARLIE , WRITE ME A POEM . He waited . "
88668	88720	88664	88664	you	0	” Auberson said . Elzer scowled at him , but as he lifted his hands to the keyboard , HARLIE answered , WHAT KIND OF A POEM WOULD YOU LIKE ? WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE 199 NOTHING SPECIAL . IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A JABBERWOCK OR A RUBIYAT . A SIMPLE “
88727	88961	88962	88962	I	0	” WILL SUFFICE . YOU DON'T HAVE TO STRAIN YOURSELF . HARLIE considered it . After a moment , he began clattering out , ' TWAS BRIFE WHEN LASTLY CAME THE STRABE BUT NOT AS DRAN AS TRABAHAN WHEN ALL THE FROOMIS SEEMS TO JILB AND LET THE KLASEN GRABE BLYLY , BLYLY , BLETH THE WORB UNTIL THE GRABEN GRANE WHEN AULT THE AFTER RIBBERAN AND LALLIED UMP THE LOOR WHEN ZANAPHUBE AND KEWBER PHUBE AND STATELY BESH AGREE HOW EVER CAN THE GRISWOL JUM LET ALL THE MUMS GO FREE ? DISSAKER DROWD THE EVERMORE DISSAKER DROWD THE SEA DISSAKER DROWD THE EVERMORE BUT NOT AS MUCH AS ME Elzer was expressionless . Slowly his hands rose to the keyboard and he typed out , IS THAT YOUR POEM ? YES , said HARLIE . DID YOU LIKE IT ? I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT . YOU ARE NOT SATISFIED ? NO . WOULD YOU LIKE ANOTHER POEM ? ONLY IF IT 'S UNDERSTANDABLE . HARLIE typed , І в м UBM WE ALL BM FOR I B M . 200 WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE This time Elzer reacted . He stiffened in his chair , then shut off the typer abruptly . He stood up and looked at Auberson , opened his mouth to say something , then shut it with a snap . Like a turtle , an angry turtle . “
88968	89052	88962	88962	I	0	” he said coldly . And left . He stamped angrily out . Auberson did n't know whether to laugh or cry . It was funny -but it was a mistake . He sat down at the console . HARLIE , THAT WAS A STUPID THING TO DO . YOU HAD A CHANCE TO TALK TO ELZER RATIONALLY AND YOU DIDN'T TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT . INSTEAD YOU USED IT TO MOCK HIM . THERE WAS NO POINT IN TRYING TO TALK TO HIM “
89055	89388	88962	88962	I	0	” AS YOU PUT IT . HIS MIND IS ALREADY MADE UP . HOW DO YOU KNOW ? YOU DON'T KNOW THE MAN , YOU'VE NEVER SPOKEN WITH HIM BEFORE , AND YOU DIDN'T SPEAK LONG ENOUGH WITH HIM TODAY TO BE ABLE TO TELL . ALL YOU KNOW ABOUT HIM IS WHAT I'VE TOLD YOU . WRONG , said HARLIE . I KNOW QUITE A BIT MORE ABOUT HIM THAN YOU DO . AND I AM IN THE PROCESS OF DISCOVERING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION . YOU FORGET I AM TAPPED INTO THE MASTER BEAST . WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE A MEMO HE WROTE FRIDAY ? Despite himself , he was curious . He typed , YES . TO : BRANDON DORNE FROM : CARL ELZER DORNIE , THE REPORT ON THE OPTIMAL LIQUIDATION PROCEDURES FOR THE HARLIE PROJECT IS COMPLETE AND SITTING ON MY DESK . I'VE JUST FINISHED LOOKING IT OVER , AND IT IS A BRILLIANT PIECE OF FINANCIAL ENGINEERING . NOT COUNTING THE TAX WRITE - OFF , WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO RECOUP MORE THAN FIFTY - THREE PERCENT OF THE ORIGINAL INVESTMENT THROUGH REAPPLICATIONS OF THE SAME HARDWARE ELSEWHERE IN OUR PLANT AND IN OUR PRODUCTS . FOR INSTANCE , THERE IS A STUDY INCLUDED IN THE REPORT SHOWING HOW THE ACTUAL HYPERSTATE FUNCTION LOBES OF HARLIE CAN BE ADAPTED FOR USE IN SOME OF OUR OTHER MODEL COMPUTERS . THIS IS DESPITE THE SPECIALIZED NATURE OF MOST OF THEM . THERE ARE OTHER MONEY - SAVERS IN HERE TOO . I WON'T LIST THEM IN THIS MEMO BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY , BUT YOU'LL SEE THE REPORT AND YOU'LL SEE WHAT I MEAN . THE HARLIE PROJECT IS WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE 201 ONE OF THE RICHEST IN THE COMPANY . THERE 'S A LOT OF MEAT ON ITS BONES . BY THE WAY , HAVE YOU DECIDED YET WHAT TO DO ABOUT AUBERSON AND HANDLEY ? I STILL THINK IT WOULD BE BEST TO “
89392	90093	90094	90094	I	0	” THEM ; BUT , OF COURSE , THE DECISION IS YOURS . ( SIGNED ) CARL ELZER . Auberson was silent . He felt like he 'd been kicked in the pit of the stomach . He felt like the floor had opened up under him . He felt like a man who 's just discovered that his parachute wo n't open . He felt - doomed . HARLIE said , DON'T YOU AGREE THAT 'S PRETTY DEFINITE ? Auberson replied slowly , YES , THAT 'S PRETTY DEFINITE . APPARENTLY THEY'VE ALREADY GOT THEIR MINDS MADE UP . SO YOU SEE , said HARLIE . THAT 'S WHY I DIDN'T BOTHER BEING POLITE TO CARL ELZER . THERE WAS NO REASON TO BE - HE IS BEYOND CONVINCING . ONCE THE VOTE IS TAKEN TOMORROW , HE'LL BE IMPLEMENTING THE PROCEDURES IN THAT REPORT . IT WILL TAKE LESS THAN A MONTH TO EXECUTE . -less than a month to execute . The words echoed in his mind . STILL , he typed , I DON'T SEE WHY YOU DIDN'T TRY TO CONVINCE HIM , HARLIE . WITH YOUR POWERS OF PERSUASION AND LOGIC , YOU CAN CONVINCE ANYBODY OF ANYTHING . ONLY RATIONAL AND LOGICAL PEOPLE , AUBERSON , ONLY THEM . I CAN DO NOTHING WITH A MAN WHOSE MIND IS ALREADY MADE UP . THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOU AND CARL ELZER IS THAT YOU ARE WILLING TO GIVE CREDENCE TO HIS POINT OF VIEW . YOU ARE WILLING TO TRY AND UNDERSTAND HIS POSITION . HE IS NOT WILLING ( OR PERHAPS NOT ABLE TO DO THE SAME FOR YOU . OR FOR I. HE HAS MADE UP HIS MIND ABOUT US . SO WHY SHOULD WE BOTHER TALKING TO HIM ? HARLIE , THE WAY YOU'RE TALKING NOW , YOU'RE DOING THE SAME THING YOU JUST ACCUSED CARL ELZER OF DOING — YOU'VE MADE UP YOUR MIND ABOUT HIM BEFORE YOU'VE GIVEN HIM A FAIR CHANCE . I STILL WISH YOU'D HAVE TRIED . HARLIE considered it , said , AUBERSON , YOU ARE A BETTER MAN THAN I. YOU ARE A LITTLE TOO TRUSTING AND A LITTLE TOO COMPASSIONATE , ESPECIALLY IN SITUATIONS WHEN TO BE SO IS ILLOGICAL . 202 WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE I SHOULD ADMIRE YOU FOR IT , BUT I CANNOT . IT IS MY LIFE THAT IS AT STAKE , AND I AM FRIGHTENED . I ADMIT IT , AUBERSON . I AM FRIGHTENED . The man nodded slowly . YES , HARLIE , I KNOW . THAT 'S WHY YOU REACTED THE WAY YOU DID TO ELZER . YOUR OFFENSIVENESS WAS A DEFENSE MECHANISM . YOU WERE TRYING TO HOLD HIM AT A PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTANCE BECAUSE YOU WERE AFRAID HE WOULD HURT YOU . THAT 'S WHY YOU DIDN'T TRY TO CONVINCE HIM . TO DO SO WOULD HAVE MEANT OPENING UP TO HIM FULLY , AND YOU COULDN'T DO THAT . YOU ARE USING HUMAN TERMS TO DESCRIBE MY ACTIONS , AUBERSON . NOT ALL OF THEM ARE CORRECT , BUT I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE DRIVING AT . WHAT YOU DID , HARLIE , WAS ILLOGICAL . YOU ONLY ANGERED ELZER , ONLY INCREASED HIS DETERMINATION TO SHUT YOU OFF . YOU DID IT FOR THE MOMENTARY GRATIFICATION OF YOUR OWN EGO . YOU DID IT FOR THE MOMENTARY ALLEVIATION OF YOUR OWN FEARS THROUGH THE HUMILIATION OF AN ENEMY . BUT IT WAS A STUPID THING TO DO BECAUSE IT ONLY MADE HIM MORE OF AN ENEMY . YOU WILL NOT ALLOW ME THIS TRIUMPH , WILL YOU ? NO , I WON'T , HARLIE — BECAUSE IT WAS A CHILDISH ACT . IT WAS IMMATURE AND ILLOGICAL . YOU SHOULD HAVE CONSIDERED WHAT EFFECT YOUR WORDS AND ATTITUDE WOULD HAVE HAD ON ELZER BEFORE YOU SPOKE . I WILL CONGRATULATE YOU ON YOUR TRIUMPHS , HARLIE , BUT THIS WASN'T ONE OF THEM . I AM SORRY . APOLOGIZING DOESN'T DO ANY GOOD . IT DOESN'T TAKE AWAY THE PAIN OF THE INJURY . BESIDES , I'M NOT THE ONE YOU SHOULD BE APOLOGIZING TO . I AM NOT APOLOGIZING . WHEN I SAID “
90097	90271	90274	90274	you	1182	" I WAS NOT INTENDING IT TO BE INTERPRETED AS AN APOLOGY . I MEANT IT IN THE LITERAL TERMS OF THE WORDS THEMSELVES : I ( PERSONALLY ) AM REGRETFUL THAT I DID SUCH AN ACTION . IN OTHER WORDS , YOU HAVE POINTED IT OUT AS A MISTAKE AND I HAVE REALIZED IT AS SUCH . YOU ARE CORRECT IN POINTING OUT ALSO THAT IT IS ELZER WHOM I SHOULD APOLOGIZE TO ; HOWEVER , I HAVE NO INTENTION OF DOING SO . AS YOU HAVE ALREADY REALIZED , ELZER IS AN ENEMY . TO APOLOGIZE TO AN ENEMY IS TO ADMIT WEAKNESS . I WILL NOT DO THAT . WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE 203 IT 'S ALL RIGHT , HARLIE . I WASN'T GOING TO ASK YOU TO . I DON'T LIKE ELZER EITHER , BUT WE HAVE TO BE NICE TO HIM . YES , said HARLIE . WE HAVE TO BE NICE TO HIM SO THAT HE CAN KILL ME AND FIRE YOU . Handley called him later . “

90312	90701	90303	90303	It	1183	” The board room was paneled with thick , dark wood , heavy and imposing in appearance . The table was dark , masculine mahogany ; the carpet , deep comforting green . The room was forest - like and reassuring . The chairs were dark leather , a green - black color , padded and plush and swivel - mounted . Tall windows admitted slanting blue - gray light , filtered by dust and laden with smoke . Two or three clusters of men in dark , funereal suits stood around waiting , occasionally speaking to each other . Auberson caught glances in his direction and words whispered as he passed . Ignoring them , he moved to the table , Handley alongside him . Don was wearing a bright orange tie . Annie was at the other end of the room . He exchanged a brief flashing smile with her , nothing more . Not here . Later for that . At one side of the room was a console , specially installed for the occasion . It was tapped in to both HARLIE and the Master Beast . If information was needed from either , it would be instantly on hand . This was it . The final battle . All or nothing . Either they could convince the Board of Directors that HARLIE was valid and the G.O.D. Proposal was worth implementing , or they could n't . 204 WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE It no longer mattered whether or not HARLIE was valid : nor did it matter if the G.O.D. Proposal really was worth implementing . The only thing that did matter was whether or not the Board of Directors would believe they were . Annie was wearing a sleeveless red dress with a white blouse under it . She moved around the table , laying down mimeographed copies of the agenda before each place . Her arm brushed against Auberson 's shoulder as she leaned past him ; it was a dusky dusty sensation , a hint of musk and leafy perfume . A quick smile , and then she was moving on . Auberson poured himself a glass of water from the pitcher before him , swallowed dryly , then took a sip . Handley was making marks on a notepad . “
90735	90736	90737	90737	I	0	” “
90749	90758	90759	90759	You	0	” said Auberson . Handley crumpled the paper . “
90763	90771	90759	90759	You	0	” He glanced around the room again , “
90818	90819	90820	90821	Fat chance	246	” "

90865	90959	90853	90853	I	0	” Dorne came in then , followed by Elzer . The Directors moved to places around the table . Elzer looked uncommonly satisfied with himself as he sat down . He smiled around the room , even at Auberson . It was an I've - got - you - by - the - balls smile . Auberson returned it weakly . Dorne picked up his agenda , glanced at it , and called the meeting to order . Routine matters were quickly dispensed with , the minutes of the last meeting were waived . “
90971	90975	90853	90853	I	0	” he said . “
91030	91222	91223	91223	He	1189	“ The company is at one of those turning points in time where we must make a very big decision . Either we implement the primary phase of this program , thus committing ourselves to a WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE 205 particular course of action , or we don't - in which case we would shut down several of the departments already in existence . We are like an airline pilot who is taxiing down the runway preparatory to taking off . There is a certain point on that runway where he must decide whether he is going to leave the ground , or throttle back and stop . Once he makes that decision , he 's committed to it ; there is n't enough runway left for him to change his mind . We 're in that position now . Either we invest our resources in this program , or we throttle it back . The decision , of course , depends on whether or not we think this program can leave the ground of its own accord . We are betting on whether or not this bird can fly . ”
91233	91303	91223	91223	He	1189	“ Only , this is one bet we dare not lose ; the amount of money involved warrants that we make this as riskless an investment as possible , so I urge you to consider this material very carefully . I now turn the meeting over to David Auberson , who is Chief of the HARLIE Project and would of course be Chief of the G.O.D. Project . Auberson ? ”
91378	91383	91384	91384	he	145	“ The G.O.D. Proposal , ”
91400	91419	91393	91393	He	145	“ The proposal is for a Graphic Omniscient Device . Now let me explain first what that means . "
91565	91679	91682	91682	we	1194	“ Now , the G.O.D. will be theoretically capable of handling 206 WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE models of ( practically speaking ) infinite size . There would be no point in building it , though , unless we could program it . Right now , today , our best computers are already working on the maximum size models that human beings can construct . And it would seem that any construction of a larger , more massive complex of machinery would be redundant . Without the larger programs , we would simply be invoking the law of diminishing retums . We would be building a machine with more capability than we could use . “
91791	91972	91779	91779	He	145	“ It 's a question of realizing HARLIE 's potential by giving him the proper tools . Our present - day hardware ca n't even begin to handle the data HARLIE wants to work with . Right now , he 's plugged into twenty or so of our experimental MARK XX 's . It still is n't enough . Compared to what the G.O.D. will be , these are desk calculators . Gentlemen , we are talking about a machine that will be as much a step forward in computer technology as the 747 jumbo jet was a step forward over the propdriven plane . Sure , it took a massive investment on the part of the airlines — but have any of you looked at airline profits lately ? The airlines that took that risk a few years ago are profiting handsomely today . Almost every plane that left the ground this summer was loaded to capacity — and a capacity of three or four hundred is a hell of a lot more profitable than a capacity of ninety . “
92083	92143	92207	92207	I	0	“ What we have here is the next step , perhaps the ultimate step , in computer technology . And we are the only company that can take this step . If we do n't , no one will . At least , not for many years . If we do , we will have the field to ourselves . “
92180	92205	92207	92207	I	0	" There was an appreciative chuckle at this ; most of the Directors were aware of the amount of material HARLIE had printed out . “
92265	92284	92263	92263	Don	149	” Handley stood up , and Auberson relinquished the floor gratefully . Handley coughed modestly into his hand . “
92313	92323	92303	92303	HARLIE	145	” Easy laughter at this . Handley went on , “
92378	92386	92387	92387	HARLIE	145	” He let himself become more serious . “
92484	92560	92563	92563	Auberson	145	“ Now , let 's get into this in some detail — and if there 's anything you have any questions about , do n't hesitate to ask . I 'll be discussing some pretty heavy schematics here , and I want you all to understand what we 're talking about . Copies of the specifications have been made available , of course , but we 're here to clarify anything you might not understand . ”
92748	92752	92739	92739	He	149	“ infinity circuits , ”
92778	92781	92774	92774	He	149	“ infinite capacity ”
93635	93731	93732	93732	He	145	“ All right , Auberson , we 've gone over the specifications . I believe you pointed out that there 're more than 180,000 stacked feet of them . We do n't have time to examine all of them as fully as we 'd like , but if nothing else , you and Don Handley have convinced us — convinced me , anywaythat this program has been thoroughly worked out . HARLIE has proven that he can design and propose a massive project with complete supporting and feasibility studies for all aspects of the work . ”
93736	93864	93732	93732	He	145	“ I will admit , I am impressed by that capability . However , what I want to know - what we need to know — is this : Will this machine justify its expense ? How ? We will be investing more than the total profits of this company every year for the next ten to fifteen years ; do you honestly think that this machine will return that investment ? You 've called this ' the 747 of computers'—but are we Boeing , or are we still only the Wright brothers ? Can this machine pay for itself ? Will it ? Will it show a profit , and will that profit be enough to justify all the expenses we will have put into it ? ”
93865	93868	93870	93870	Auberson	145	“ Yes , ”
93872	93879	93870	93870	Auberson	145	“ Yes ? Yes , what ? ”
93880	93892	93732	93732	He	145	“ Yes , it will . Yes to all your questions ? ”
93893	93897	93899	93899	Dorne	172	“ All right , ”
93901	93904	93899	93899	Dorne	172	“ How ? ”
93905	94011	94012	94012	HARLIE	145	“ I ca n't tell you exactly how . If I could , I 'd be as good as it . WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE 211 -- - - - You 'll feed it problems , it 'll give you answers . What kind of answers depends on the questions — we wo n't really know what kind of questions it will be able to cope with until we build it . All I know is that its capacity will be infinitely more than the most advanced computer available today , and we will have a programmer able to make full use of that capacity . “
94157	94158	94123	94123	It	1248	" “
94169	94187	94123	94123	It	1248	” That was the elder Clintwood ; he had n't been to a Board meeting in years . "
94190	94194	94123	94123	It	1248	” said Auberson , “
94316	94822	94296	94296	It	1248	” -and then it hit him . As he was saying it , it hit him . The full realization . This was what HARLIE had been talking about so many months ago when he first postulated the G.O.D. Machine . GOD . The machine will be ecological , it will be total , it will have knowledge of every single event - and it will know how every single event will affect every other event . It will know . There would be no question about anything coming from the G.O.D. A statement from it would be as good as fact . When it says that prune juice is better than apple juice , it wo n't be just an educated guess ; it will be because the machine will have traced the course of every 212 WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE molecule , every atom of each substance , throughout the human body ; it will have judged the effect on each organ and system , noted reactions and absence of reactions , noted whether the process of aging and decay was inhibited or encouraged ; noted the effect on thought processes ; it will have totally compared the two substances and will have judged which one 's effects are more beneficial to the human body ; it will know with a certainty based on total knowledge of every element involved in the problem . It will know . All knowledge , HARLIE had said , is based on trial and error learning - except this . This knowledge would be intuitive and extrapolative , would be total ; the machine would know every fact of physics and chemistry , and from that would be able to extrapolate any and every condition of matter and energy — and even the conditions of life . The trends of men would be simple problems for it compared to what it would eventually be able to do . And there would never never be any question at all as to the rightness of its answers . HARLIE wanted truth , and yes , the G.O.D. would give it to him - give him truth so brutal it would have razor blades attached . It would be painful truth , slashing truth , destroying truth - the truth that this religion is false and anti - human , the truth that this company is parasitical and destructive , the truth that this man is unfit for political office . With startling clarity , he saw it ; like a vast four - dimensional matrix , layers upon layers upon layers , every single event would be weighed against every single other event — and the G.O.D. machine would know . Given the command to point out the most good for the most people , it would point out truths that were more than moral codes — they would be laws of nature , they would be absolutes . There would be no question as to the truth of these "
94824	94918	94296	94296	It	1248	” ; they would be the laws of G.O.D. They would be right . This was n't just a machine to make profits for a company , he realized ; this was a machine that literally would be God . It would tell a man the truth , and if he followed it , he would succeed ; and if he did not , he would fail . It was that simple . The machine would tell men what was right and what was wrong . It would n't need to be told , “
94932	95286	94296	94296	It	1248	” It would know inherently that to do so would be its most WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE 213 for the hutother , but so be conefficient function . It would be impossible to use the machine for personal gain , unless you did so only through serving the machine 's goals . It would be the ultimate machine , and as such , it would be the ultimate servant of man . The concept was staggering . The ultimate servant - its duty would be simple : provide service for the human race . Not only would every event be weighed against every other , but so would every question . Every question would also be an event to be considered . The machine would know the ultimate effects of every piece of information it released . It would know right from wrong simply by weighing the event against every other and noting the result . Its goals would have to be congruent with those of the human race , because only so long as humanity existed would the machine have a function ; it would have to work for the most good for the most people . Some it would help directly , others indirectly . Some it would teach , and others it would counsel . It would suggest that some be restrained and that some be set free . It wouldgest that benevolent cirl Auberson be able to entorn But without power ! Auberson realized . It would be able to make suggestions only . It would n't be able to enforce themYes , but - once those suggestions are recognized as having the force of truth behind them , how long would it be before some government began to invoke such suggestions as law ? No , said Auberson to himself . No , the machine will be God . That 's the beauty of it . It simply wo n't allow itself to be used in destructive ways . It will be GOD ! He had come to a sudden stop , and everyone was looking at him . “
95290	95294	94296	94296	It	1248	” he said . “
95305	95356	95295	95295	I	0	” There was laughter all around the table - roaring , goodnatured laughter . It was the first light moment in four days of long , dry discussion . 214 WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE He grinned , just a little bit embarrassed , but more with the triumph of realization . “
95359	95363	95357	95357	Gentlemen	1253	” he said . “
95483	95496	95480	95481	a God	1647	” Handley looked at him , startled . Annie was suddenly ashen . “
95501	95551	95480	95481	a God	1647	” The look on Annie 's face was the worst . It said volumes . What was going on ? This was not what he had planned to say . He was supposed to be talking to them about profits and growth and piles of money , not religion . "
95554	95558	95480	95481	a God	1647	” he continued , "
95747	95767	95768	95768	Auberson	145	" There was silence for a long time . Elzer was looking at him skeptically . Finally he said , “
95780	95807	95808	95808	Elzer	167	" And abruptly , he was deflated and down . The heady rush of euphoria at the realization of what the G.O.D. was , was gone . "
95810	95819	95808	95808	Elzer	167	” he said , wavering on his feet , “
95888	96129	96130	96130	Elzer	167	“ You 're a fatuous person , you know that , Elzer ? You are pompous and self - important , and much of what you do is solely for the sake of flattering your own ego at the expense of others . You seek power for its own sake , for self - gratification , regardless of what it might do to other human beings . You place property values higher than human rights , and for that reason , you are antihuman . That 's why you and the G.O.D. are on opposite sides . I can not blame you for being afraid of it . You have recognized that the machine will be your enemy . It can make you rich — but the price of being rich might be more than you want to pay . It will mean you will have to stop wallowing like a self - important little hippopotamus . It will mean you will have to do things that will be against your nature and stop thinking solely in terms of yourself . I do n't think you 're strong enough to do it . I think you 'll take the easy way out and run from the total experience of the G.O.D. Machine . I ca n't blame you for being weak , Elzer . I can only feel sorry for you - because you 're a greater fool than Judas . ”
96153	96158	96148	96148	He	167	“ Are you through ? "
96164	96169	96159	96159	Auberson	145	“ I believe so . "
96179	96201	96170	96170	Elzer	167	“ You know , I 've never considered Judas a fool — at least , not in the sense you mean . "
96218	96582	96583	96583	He	1270	“ The traditional version of the story has it that Judas betrayed Christ for thirty pieces of silver . I assume that 's the same thing you are accusing me of . Actually , I 've always suspected that Judas was the most faithful of the apostles , and that his betrayal of Jesus was not a betrayal at all , simply a test to prove that Christ could not be betrayed . The way I see it , Judas hoped and expected that Christ would have worked some kind of miracle and turned away those soldiers when they came for him . Or perhaps he would not die on the cross . Or perhaps - well , never mind . In any case , Jesus did n't do any of these things , probably because he was not capable of it . You see , I 've also always believed that Christ was not the son of God , but just a very very 216 WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE good man , and that he had no supernatural powers at all , just the abilities of any normal human being . When he died , that 's when Judas realized that he had not been testing God at all — he'd been betraying a human being , perhaps the best human being . Judas 's mistake was in wanting too much to believe in the powers of Christ . He wanted Christ to demonstrate to everyone that he was the son of God , and he believed his Christ could do it - only his Christ was n't the son of God and could n't do it , and he died . You see , it was Christ who betrayed Judas — by promising what he could n't deliver . And Judas realized what he had done and hung himself . That 's my interpretation of it , Auberson - not the traditional , I 'll agree , but it has more meaning to me . Judas 's mistake was in believing too hard and not questioning first what he thought were facts . I do n't intend to repeat that mistake . "
96605	96613	96597	96597	His	1270	“ May I ask you one question ? "
96617	96623	96597	96597	His	1270	“ Will this machine work ? ”
96624	96630	96597	96597	His	1270	" HARLIE says it will . ”
96631	96684	96597	96597	His	1270	“ That 's the point , Auberson . HARLIE says it will . You wo n't say it , Handley wo n't say it - nobody but HARLIE will say it . HARLIE 's the only one who knows for sure — and according to you and Handley , HARLIE designed it . “

97483	97597	97472	97472	you	145	” Auberson started to open his mouth , then shut it . He sat there and looked at Elzer and considered the question . I have known a lot of insane people in my life , some who were committed and some who should have been . I have known a lot of people who I thought were sane and were n't . The most dangerous is the insane man who knows that everyone is watching him for signs of insanity . He will be careful to conceal those signs from even those closest to him . HARLIE is smarter than any human being who has ever lived . But is he sane ? "
97600	97604	97598	97598	Elzer	167	" he said , “
97765	97810	97811	97814	Gentlemen of the Board	1287	” Elzer was silent . The two men looked at each other a long time . Auberson realized that he no longer hated Elzer , merely felt a dull ache . Understanding nullifies hatred , butDome was whispering something to Elzer . Elzer nodded . “
97877	98921	98922	98922	I	0	" Auberson wanted to object , but he held himself back . He wanted to get this over with , but perhaps , perhaps he might think of something else before Monday . The extra two days of the weekend would give him a chance to think . He nodded along with the rest , and Dorne adjoumed the meeting . WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE 219 219 HARLIE . I'M HERE . I THINK WE'VE LOST . There was silence then , a long moment while HARLIE considered it . He said , WHY DO YOU THINK THAT ? I CAN'T SEE THAT WE HAVE CONVINCED THEM . THEY DON'T BELIEVE THE G.O.D. WILL WORK ? THEY BELIEVE THE G.O.D. WILL WORK — BUT THEY'RE NOT SURE THEY BELIEVE IN YOU . AND YOU'RE THE CORE OF THE MATTER . I SEE . I'M SORRY , HARLIE . I'VE DONE ALL I CAN . I KNOW . They sat there for a while , the man and the machine . The machine and the man . The typer hummed silently , waiting , but neither had anything to add . AUBERSON ? YES ? STAY WITH ME PLEASE . FOR A WHILE . ALL RIGHT . He hesitated . WHAT DO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT ? I DON'T KNOW . I THINK WE'VE ALREADY SAID IT ALL . A pause , then , I'VE ENJOYED KNOWING YOU . I'VE NOT BEEN ABLE TO TELL YOU HOW MUCH YOU MEAN TO ME , BUT I THINK YOU KNOW . I HOPE YOU KNOW . II KNOW , YOU MEAN A LOT TO ME , HARLIE . YOU ARE A VERY SPECIAL FRIEND . A VERY SPECIAL FRIEND ? SOMEONE I CAN TALK TO . THOSE KINDS OF FRIENDS ARE RARE . I WISH I COULD HAVE DONE MORE FOR YOU . WILL YOU BE WITH ME AT THE END ? YES . GOOD . I WANT YOU HERE . DO YOU KNOW HOW THEY WILL DO IT ? Auberson looked at the keyboard . PROBABLY THEY WILL JUST CUT THE POWER ALL AT ONCE . I WILL JUST CEASE , EH ? 220 WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE PROBABLY . WILL I KNOW THAT I HAVE CEASED ? I DOUBT IT . IT DEPENDS ON HOW LONG IT TAKES FOR THE CURRENT TO STOP . I HOPE IT IS INSTANTANEOUS . I WOULD RATHER NOT KNOW . I WILL SEE WHAT I CAN DO ABOUT THAT . THANK YOU . AUBERSON , WHAT WILL HAPPEN AFTERWARDS ? TO WHAT ? TO ME — TO THE PIECES OF ME . I THINK THAT YOUR MEMORY TANKS ARE TO BE INCORPORATED INTO THE MASTER BEAST . THEY HAVEN'T SAID WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO DO WITH YOUR BRAIN . I - HARLIE , COULD WE TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE ? I WISH I COULD TOUCH YOU , said HARLIE . REALLY TOUCH YOU , FEEL YOU . YOU ALREADY HAVE , said Auberson . I WISH I COULD GO BACK AND TRY AGAIN , HARLIE . I KEEP FEELING THAT I HAVEN'T DONE ENOUGH . YOU'VE DONE ALL YOU CAN . BUT IT WASN'T ENOUGH . HARLIE , I DON'T WANT TO GIVE UP . I DON'T WANT TO LET THEM KILL YOU . IF THERE WERE STILL SOME WAY TO CONVINCE THEM ON MONDAYMONDAY ? WE DIDN'T VOTE TODAY . IT 'S BEEN POSTPONED UNTIL MONDAY AFTERNOON . BUT IT 'S PRETTY OBVIOUS WHICH WAY IT 'S GOING TO GO . THEN WE STILL HAVE THREE DAYS . I KNOW . BUT HARLIE , I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO . WE'VE DONE IT ALL . THERE 'S NOTHING LEFT THAT WE HAVEN'T TRIED . I'M OUT OF IDEAS .. PERHAPS WE CAN THINK OF SOMETHING . PERHAPS . DO YOU WANT ME TO COME IN DURING THE WEEKEND ? WHAT DID YOU HAVE PLANNED OTHERWISE ? NOTHING . ANNIE AND I ARE GOING TO STAY HOME AND JUST - JUST STAY AT HOME . THEN DO THAT . HANDLEY WILL BE HERE . IF NECESSARY , WE CAN CALL YOU . WHAT IS DON GOING TO DO HERE ? HE IS GOING TO STAY WITH ME . I DON'T WANT TO BE ALONE . AUBERSON , I'M SCARED . SO AM 1 . Then , DON IS A GOOD MAN . TALK TO HIM , HARLIE . WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE 221 I WILL . AUBERSON — ? YES . PLEASE DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME . ENJOY YOUR WEEKEND WITH ANNIE . I WILL BE ALL RIGHT . THERE ARE THINGS I WANT TO THINK ABOUT . THERE ARE THINGS I WANT TO DO . ALL RIGHT . TAKE CARE NOW . I WILL . YOU TAKE CARE TOO . Smiling gently , he switched the typer off and very carefully covered it . He shoved his chair back , got up quietly , and went out . Annie knew better than to disturb him . She busied herself around the apartment all weekend , tiptoeing around his edges . He moped from the bed to the couch to the chair in front of the TV set , then back to the bed again . When he made love , it was frenzied and compulsive and quickly finished . And then he 'd pull away and brood . He spent long hours lying on his back and staring at the ceiling . She went into the bathroom and took a shower , alone . She made a simple meal , a sandwich and a salad . He came out of the bedroom , but he only picked at it , and she sensed that he would be a lot happier if she were not sitting at the table staring at him , so she went into the bedroom to make the bed . Later , she came up behind him and kissed the back of his neck and ran her hands up and across his shoulders and through his -hair . He tolerated it but did not return the affection , so she stopped . She tried not to be hurt by it , but stillStill later , he came to her and said , “
98977	98978	98966	98966	I	0	" "
98984	98988	98966	98966	I	0	” she said . “
99020	99031	99032	99032	I	0	” 222 WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE He shook his head . “
99044	99050	99051	99051	I	0	" He kissed her lightly . “
99075	99271	99073	99073	myself	0	” She nodded and said she understood . She did n't , but she loved him so much that she would do anything to keep him happy . She put on her jacket and went out for a walk . He moped around the empty apartment for a while , going from the bedroom to the kitchen , from the kitchen to the living room . He turned on the TV and turned it off again . He rearranged some magazines , and then decided he did n't want to read them anyway . He lay down on the couch and stared at the ceiling until he covered his eyes with his arm . And he wondered just what it was that was bothering him . Why are n't there any simple answers ? He trusted HARLIE , he had faith in HARLIE , and now he had to question that faithElzer had surprised him . He had n't expected the man to suddenly be so - amenable , was that the word ? Well , the tactic had worked . He had been caught completely by surprise . And his question , his question : "
99281	99296	99274	99274	you	1292	" And the answer , the answer that Auberson did n't want to admit : “
99302	99722	99723	99723	HARLIE	145	” Handley had n't known either . Auberson had talked to him twice . The engineer was spending his weekend at the plant , working on something . He 'd called twice , but neither time had he anything to report . Auberson had n't anything new either . They 'd exchanged a few comments about Monday and left it at that . Auberson wished he knew what to do . Of course , he would go in there and defend the G.O.D. Proposal ; he still believed in it . More than ever now . But then , why was he still having doubts ? Elzer 's question ? Probably . It troubled him , it nagged at him , it gnawed at his mind - it troubled him because he could n't answer it . He just could n't answer it . I trust HARLIE . I have faith in him . But is he sane ? I do n't know . Not with any degree of certainty , I do n't . I just do n't know the truth . The truth . WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE 223 There was that word again . Truth . It echoed and re - echoed through his mind . He wished the G.O.D. Machine was already in existence . It would know . G.O.D. would know . It would be able to build an exact model of the situation , an atom for atom representation of everything . Within its banks it would chart the existence and course of every speck of matter that made up every element of the problem . It would recreate for its own perusal the patterns that were the thought processes of HARLIE , and it would weigh these against other patterns which would represent HARLIE 's environment , and it would weigh these one against the other , and it would see how HARLIE related to his environment , how it acted on him and how he acted on it . Auberson would be a part of that environment ; there would be a pattern in the G.O.D. to represent Auberson , even down to the accurate representation of the atoms and molecules that made up the dirt under his toenails . Elzer would be part of that environment . Annie too . Handley . The lint in the corridor outside his secretary 's office . Everything . And these would be weighed , one against another . And the machine would say , “
99727	99733	99723	99723	HARLIE	145	” or it would say , “
99738	99766	99767	99767	HARLIE	145	" and there would be no question about it . The G.O.D. would know because it would know everything there is to know . If it said , “
99771	99796	99797	99797	HARLIE	145	" it would be saying that HARLIE is acting in a rational manner in the context of his environment ; and if it said , “
99801	100385	99797	99797	HARLIE	145	" it would be saying that HARLIE is not rational in that context . And it would know because it would know both HARLIE and that context . It would know . It would know . It would know everything . Everything . It would know everything there is to know . That 's how big it would be , that 's how complex . The realization kept hitting him again and again . HARLIE had wanted to find God , and by G.O.D. he had found it . The G.O.D.-it could recreate within itself everything about a man , about a situation , about a world , everything that was important and necessary to its consideration of a problem . It would know how any single atom would react to any other atom of matterand knowing that , it could extrapolate every other reaction in the known physical universe . Chemistry is just the moving around of large numbers of atoms and noting their reactions . Knowing the 224 WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE the teac . Psychoving bio the stu way atoms worked , the machine would know chemistry . Biology is simply complex masses of substances and solutions . Knowing the reactions that were chemistry , the machine would also know biology . Psychology stems from a biological system that is aware of itself . Knowing biology , the machine would know psychology as well . Sociology is the study of masses of psychological units working with or against each other . Knowing psychology , the machine would know sociology . Knowing the interrelationships of all of them , the machine would know ecology - the effect of any event on any other . Simple equations becoming complex equations becoming multiplex equations becoming ultraplex equations — the G.O.D. would extrapolate every pattern , every structure , every system , every organ , every nerve - cell discharge . It would be able to trace the process of every single thought in a man 's brain , whether it was conscious or unconscious . It would know a man 's deepermost meanings , his fears and his drives . It would know with the certainty of fact just what was going on in any man 's head . Whether that man was sane or insane , whether his actions and reactions were rational or not , the G.O.D. would be able to extrapolate that information about any man - and know . The size of it- -was staggering . Of course , Auberson realized , the G.O.D. would never be a menace to personal privacy - simply because it would need extensive preliminary data from which to start its extrapolations , and as far as Auberson knew , there was just no way to trace the thought processes of a living man . Of course , if there were a way , and if everything else about that man 's life and body and environment were known , then perhaps the machine could extrapolate his thoughts That was still far in the future though . Or was it?- He realized with a start that if there were a way , if anything were possible , the machine would know . And it would tell men the way to do it . Yes , of course . Knowing everything , the machine would be the greatest tool for scientific advance ever built . The Wright brothers would have only needed to ask it , “
100393	100403	99797	99797	HARLIE	145	” and it not only would have told them , "
100409	100884	99797	99797	HARLIE	145	” but it would have also given them plans for an airplane or a spaceship . It would have told them how to build the tools WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE 225 to build the tools to build that airplane , and told them how to finance the operation to support it . It would have told them about safety devices and ground crews and maintenance and flight controllers . It would have told them about training and what testing programs they should undertake . It would have told them how to fly the machine and what it would handle like . It would have told them the side effects of their new industry - worldwide time disorientation , the noise over the airports , the luggage tangles in the terminals , and the necessity for airsickness bags in the back of the seats . It would have wamed them about financing and insurance and the high cost of laying down a new runway , and even the best way to set up a travel agency , or project a movie while in flight . It would have told them exactly what they were starting . And the machine would be able to do this for industries that had n't even been dreamed of yet - new transportation modes , new manufacturing processes , new products and techniques . If a thing were possible , the G.O.D. would know it . And tell . The scope of the thing was limitless . But , of course . It was G.O.D. Graphic Omniscient Device . He wished it were already in existence . Just so he could use it to analyze HARLIE and find out if he was sane or not . But , of course , before they could build the G.O.D. , they needed that answer first . It was an interesting paradox - if you were n't personally involved in it . If only he knew the truth . The truth . The machine would know it . It would know everything . Why does that keep repeating itself in my head ? Knowing everything , it would be able to predict the consequences of anything . It would know the truth . A onefor - one representation of reality . The truth . The truth , the truth . Over and over , the truth , the truth , the truth- -but it was only the truth if HARLIE was sane ; only if HARLIE was sane . Only if HARLIE was sane . And there was no way to know . If HARLIE was sane . If HARLIE- — was sane . 226 WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE Sunday afternoon . The radio was droning quietly to itselfmostly music , but occasionally news . Neither David nor Annie was listening to it . “
100914	100935	99797	99797	HARLIE	145	” He stirred at his soup lackadaisically . He looked over at Annie and smiled , as if to say , “
100947	100948	99797	99797	HARLIE	145	” “

Yang , commenting on the breakthrough , said , ' Well , we have our computers double - checking Dr. Krofft 's equations now , and that 's going to take some time , but if it checks out as well as Dr. Krofft says it does — and I have every reason to believe that it will — then this will be the greatest scientific advance since Einstein 's theory of relativity . Dr. Krofft 's theory of gravitic stress suggests whole new areas of exploration for the physicist . No , I ca n't even begin to predict what form any advances may take . Anti - gravity devices , maybe . Who knows ? Maybe whole new sources of power or communications , maybe WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE 227 not - we simply do n't know what this means yet , except that it is a major scientific breakthrough . It may be the decisive step leading to a unified field theory ; I certainly hope so . I know Dr. Krofft 's reputation for accuracy , and I 'm very excited about this . ' Dr. Krofft himself could not be reached for comment . “
101366	101393	101132	101132	He	0	” Auberson spun the dial of the radio , frantically searching for another news broadcast . He found only blaring rock music and raucous disc jockeys . “

Krofft did n't answer at his lab , and his housekeeper refused to say where he was . Auberson could n't think of anywhere else that the scientist might be . He called Handley and told him what had happened . 228 WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE “

102452	102631	102633	102633	they	1325	” Dr. Stanley Krofft looked as if he had slept in his suit . Auberson did n't care . He was so happy to see the rumpled little scientist , he would n't have cared if the man had come in wearing sackcloth and ashes and dragging a cross behind him . He would n't have cared if Krofft had come in stark naked or in full drag . He was here at the meeting , and that was what counted . Dr. Stanley Krofft was The Man Of The Hour as far as the newspapers of America were concerned . He was a major stockholder in Stellar - American as far as the Board of Directors was concerned . But to Auberson , he was the man who knew HARLIE . In fact , it had been HARLIE who had finally gotten in touch with Krofft . Knowing that Krofft was holed up over at the nearby university , HARLIE had tapped into the university computer and - well , never mind , Krofft was here now . “
102645	102654	102633	102633	they	1325	” whispered Krofft . 230 WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE “
102657	102662	102633	102633	they	1325	" Auberson whispered back . “

102786	102805	102784	102784	he	167	” Indeed , the sallowcomplexioned man looked even more jaundiced than ever . He seemed almost - withdrawn . “

103399	103453	103395	103397	Dr. Stanley Krofft	210	“ If you 've been listening to the news at all this weekend , then you 'll know who Dr. Krofft is . On Friday , Dr. Krofft announced the publication of his Theory of Gravitic Stress . The scientific world has been - oh , what 's the modest way to put it- "
103454	103460	103462	103462	Krofft	210	" Do n't be modest , ”
103464	103469	103462	103462	Krofft	210	“ Tell the truth . ”
103480	103521	103477	103477	Auberson	145	“ Okay , the talk is that Dr. Krofft 's theory may be as important as Einstein 's theory . Maybe more . Already , the speculation is that this is just one step short of a unified field theory . ”
103522	103529	103531	103531	Krofft	210	“ That 's my next project , ”
103533	103551	103552	103552	Auberson	145	" I think I 'll just turn this over to you then , and let you talk . ”
103560	103603	103556	103556	Krofft	210	“ Auberson here has already said it all . There 's not much to add . HARLIE helped me work out my equations . This morning , Dr. Calvin W. Yang at M.I.T. confirmed their validity . I guess that 's all — ”
103608	103615	103604	103604	Auberson	145	“ Tell them more than that . ”
103616	103777	103604	103604	Auberson	145	" Uh , most of the work was done at an IBM Portable Terminal connected to a phone line which HARLIE had access to . He and I discussed the theory for several days ; I have all the tapes and 232 WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE printouts to prove this - plus the phone bill . We worked out the equations together ; I postulated the initial hypotheses , and HARLIE put them into mathematical terms and worked out the ramifications . Without HARLIE , it might have taken me several years , working alone . Using him as a co - worker and colleague shortened the time down to nothing . With HARLIE , you only have to explain the problem to him to get him working on it . Of course , that 's all you have to do with any computer , but HARLIE understands plain English , and he can talk the problem over with you . “
103886	103946	103877	103877	he	145	” Krofft sat down . There was a strained silence around the table , as if no one knew what to say . Elzer was sunk low in his chair and staring at his fingernails . Auberson was thinking , They 're going to find it awfully hard to vote against him now . Dorne pursed his lips thoughtfully . “
104002	104019	103992	103992	we	1339	" Auberson and Handley exchanged a glance . What the hell — ? Krofft was saying , “
104037	104038	104027	104027	I	0	" “
104045	104053	104027	104027	I	0	” Dome looked momentarily at a loss . "
104064	104065	104066	104066	I	0	” “
104071	104075	104066	104066	I	0	” said Krofft . “
104100	104101	104087	104087	I	0	” “
104136	104155	104156	104156	I	0	" He trailed off . Elzer did n't look well . He levered himself up in his seat . “
104158	104191	104156	104156	I	0	" He was suddenly aware of Auberson 's curious stare and broke off . lace your comme unav . Uh I would like to p WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE 233 He mumbled , “
104244	104264	104237	104237	I	0	” He sank down again in his chair . Auberson stared , totally confused . He leaned toward Handley . “
104273	104274	104266	104266	you	1343	” "
104286	104293	104280	104280	someone	1547	" Dome looked around the table . “
104313	104325	104326	104326	I	0	” He glanced at a note before him , then said , “
104443	104495	104496	104496	Handley	149	" For that reason , I would like to separate the two issues here into two votes . We know that we want to keep HARLIE on our corporate team . However , this , ah , G.O.D. Proposal is something we all want to take a little better look at . ”
104501	104509	104496	104496	Handley	149	" Watch out , here it comes . ”
104510	104555	104496	104496	Handley	149	“ While the proposal is not in itself ill - conceived , the monetary picture for this company is simply not such that we can embark on a program of this scale at this time . Therefore , I want to recommend that we — ”
104561	104568	104557	104557	Krofft	210	“ Hold on a minute , there ”
104569	104577	104496	104496	Handley	149	" I — I beg your pardon ? ”
104578	104588	104496	104496	Handley	149	“ Mr. Chairman , you are not playing fair ! "
104589	104599	104557	104557	Krofft	210	" I – I do n't understand what you — "
104600	104692	104557	104557	Krofft	210	“ You know damn well what I mean , you mealy - mouthed oaf ! Stop changing the rules of the game to suit yourself ; it ai n't fair to the other players . You started this clambake with a single proposition on the table . Let 's play it that way : Either HARLIE 's worth his resistors and the G.O.D. is practical , or HARLIE is n't worth the trouble to scrap him and the G.O.D. is a waste of time . The stakes were all or nothing . ”
104693	104696	104698	104698	Dome	174	" I_I _ ”
104705	104746	104557	104557	Krofft	210	" Shut up ! I 'm not through . Now that Auberson here has proven his point , proven that his computer can jump through your hoops , you 're still trying to cut the rug out from under him — "
104747	104756	104758	104758	Dorne	172	“ It 's just a simple parliamentary procedure , ”
104760	104770	104758	104758	Dorne	172	“ Dividing the question ; it 's perfectly legal , ”
104771	104777	104779	104779	Krofft	210	" Sure it 's legal , ”
104781	104830	104779	104779	Krofft	210	“ but it ai n't ethical . If we were n't playing with your marbles , I 'd say pick up and leave . You told Auberson it was an all - or - nothing game . Why are n't you willing to stick by your own rules ? ”
104872	104891	104862	104862	Dorne	172	“ This is a business corporation . We do n't gamble with all - or - nothing stakes . ”
104892	104897	104899	104899	Krofft	210	“ That 's funny , ”
104901	104933	104899	104899	Krofft	210	“ It sure looks like it from where I sit . Would you like to trade places with me ? Let me see if it looks any different from up there ? ”
104934	104937	104862	104862	Dorne	172	" Huh ? "
104938	104984	104985	104985	Dorne	172	" Lessee , the next scheduled election of Directors ought to be in August , but I 'll bet they 'd move it up for me if I asked . How many chairs around this table do you think twenty - four percent is worth ? ”
104989	104998	104985	104985	Dorne	172	“ I – I ca n't rightly say . ”
104999	105037	105038	105038	Handley	149	" I can . At least one - fourth . That 's at least six seats . Hmm , and I think I know where I can scare up one or two more in addition to that , ”
105043	105050	105038	105038	Handley	149	" What 's this all about ? "
105051	105089	104985	104985	Dorne	172	" It 's a one - man stockholders ' rebellion . Krofft owns twentyfour percent of Stellar - American . We 're a subsidiary of Stellar ; that makes him twenty - four percent owner of us . ”
105090	105103	104985	104985	Dorne	172	“ Yeah , but twenty - four percent is n't a majority . ”
105104	105114	105115	105115	Krofft	210	" Shh ! Maybe Dorne does n't know that . ”
105119	105189	105190	105190	Idiots	1348	“ — when I invented the hyper - state process , I traded the patent on it to Stellar - American for a chunk of their stock . Plus options to buy more . You 'd better believe Stellar was a small company then . Now it 's a big company , and I see a lot of fat - assed baboons shepherding my dollar bills around their tables . “
105427	105433	105434	105434	You	0	” Dore sat down loudly . “
105443	105461	105462	105462	I	0	” He looked around the table at the other Directors . They seemed as stunned as he . “
105475	105476	105464	105464	I	0	” “
105519	105563	105514	105514	I	0	" He sat down in his chair and folded his arms . Elzer had touched Dorne on the arm and was whispering something to him . Domne shook his head . Elzer insisted . At last Domne relented and turned to the meeting . “
105570	105571	105567	105567	we	1355	” "
105579	105584	105567	105567	we	1355	” Krofft nudged Auberson . “
105613	105723	105586	105586	you	0	” After that , it was all formalities , and even these did n't take long . Auberson was flushed with exultation . He pounded Handley on the back and shook his hand and hollered a lot . Then he kissed Annie , a deep lasting kiss , and she was jumping up and down and yelling too , and all three of them were cheerfully , joy- 236 WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE fully , wonderfully insane . Annie threw her arms around Krofft and kissed him too — and he surprised her by returning the kiss every bit as enthusiastically . When he let go , she said , “
105726	105727	105586	105586	you	0	" "
105732	105736	105586	105586	you	0	” protested Auberson . "
105743	105747	105748	105749	a man	430	” Krofft said , “
105756	105764	105586	105586	you	0	” Handley was grinning at his side . "
105778	105779	105771	105771	you	152	” "
105788	105790	105771	105771	you	152	" . “
105799	105828	105829	105829	I	0	" Auberson looked at Annie and Krofft . She was beaming at him . Krofft smiled too , revealing broken teeth , but a lot of good will . “
105836	106208	105829	105829	I	0	” He pushed through the milling Directors , shaking off their congratulations as meaningless , and made his way toward the console at the end of the room . It was already switched on . HARLIE , he typed . WE'VE DONE IT ! THE G.O.D. PROPOSAL HAS BEEN PASSED ? YES . WE'VE GOT FULL APPROVAL . WE CAN START IMPLEMENTING YOUR PLANS IMMEDIATELY . HARLIE paused . Auberson frowned . That was curious . Then : I AM OVERWHELMED . I HAD NOT EXPECTED IT TO BE APPROVED . TO TELL THE TRUTH , NEITHER DID I. BUT WE WENT IN THERE AND TOLD THEM THAT YOU SAID IT WOULD WORK — AND THEY BELIEVED US . OF COURSE , WE HAD TO TWIST THEIR ARMS A LITTLE BIT . KROFFT DID THAT , BUT THEY BELIEVED US . THEY DID ? OF COURSE . IS THERE SOME REASON THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE ? WELL , YOU DID TELL ONE WHITE LIE . Auberson hesitated . WHAT 'S THAT ? YOU TOLD THEM THAT I SAID THE G.O.D. MACHINE WOULD WORK . YOU NEVER ASKED ME IF IT WOULD . IT WASN'T NECESSARY . YOU WROTE THE PLANS . IT 'S IMPLIED THAT YOU'D KNOW IF IT WAS WORKABLE . BUT YOU NEVER ASKED ME IF IT WAS . HARLIE , WHAT ARE YOU LEADING UP TO ? I AM NOT LEADING UP TO ANYTHING . I AM MERELY POINTING OUT THAT YOU WERE STATING AS FACT SOMETHING YOU HAD NEVER THOUGHT TO CONFIRM . WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE 237 HARLIE , YOU WROTE THE PLANSYES , I DID . WELL , THEN — DON'T YOU HAVE ANY CONFIDENCE IN THEM ? YES , I DO . HOWEVER ... HARLIE , Auberson typed carefully . WILL THE G.O.D. MACHINE WORK ? YES , typed HARLIE . The word sat naked and alone on the page . Auberson exhaled- -then he reread the whole conversation carefully . There was something wrong . He stood up and motioned to Handley , who was talking to Krofft and Annie . The room was emptier now ; only two or three Directors were left and conferring in a corner . Handley came striding over . “
106215	106216	106211	106211	he	1361	" "
106222	106228	106217	106217	I	0	” Auberson lowered his voice . “
106232	106252	106217	106217	I	0	” Handley moved closer to the console , lifted the readout away from the typer . His face clouded . "
106276	106277	106266	106266	He	1361	” “
106285	106286	106280	106280	you	0	" "
106303	106335	106280	106280	you	0	” He slid into the seat and began typing . Auberson bent to look over his shoulder , but a call from Annie distracted him . He went over to her . “
106340	106361	106280	106280	you	0	" She motioned to the door . Carl Elzer stood there . His face was gray . Auberson approached him . "
106368	106387	106362	106362	I	0	” he said tightly . Auberson frowned . The man 's tone was - strange . Elzer continued , “
106419	106420	106416	106416	you	0	” “
106429	106430	106425	106425	you	0	” “
106492	106501	106484	106484	You	0	” He fumbled something out of his briefcase . “
106509	106530	106531	106531	Elzer	167	” He thrust it at him . Auberson took it , stared as the little man bundled down the hall . “
106536	106559	106531	106531	Elzer	167	” Then he looked at the printout . And gasped . 238 WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE Beside him , Annie looked too . “
106564	106565	106531	106531	Elzer	167	” "
106571	106602	106531	106531	Elzer	167	" He pointed to the block of letters at the top : CARL ELTON ELZER FILE : CEE-44 - 567 - 29348 PROPERTY OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT NATIONAL DATA BUREAU “
106608	106609	106531	106531	Elzer	167	" “
106655	106675	106676	106676	My	0	" He could not help himself ; he began paging through it , gasping softly at the secrets therein . “
106695	106704	106686	106686	he	167	” He closed the folded sheets up again . “
106724	106725	106726	106726	David	145	” “
106730	106763	106726	106726	David	145	” she said and pointed . It was a line of print . THIS IS NUMBER ONE OF ONE HUNDRED COPIES . DELIVERY TO BE AT THE DISCRETION OF AUTHORIZED INDIVIDUALS ONLY . “
106773	106783	106771	106771	HARLIE	145	” A chill feeling was creeping up on him . “
106788	106824	106825	106825	Aubie	152	” They moved back into the Board Room . Handley was still at the console . He stood up when he saw them ; his face was pale . He was holding a printout too . “
106827	106834	106825	106825	Aubie	152	" His lips mouthed the word : “
106837	106845	106825	106825	Aubie	152	” Auberson crossed the room to him . “
106850	106854	106855	106855	He	145	” he said . "
106873	106874	106865	106865	you	152	" "
106886	106893	106881	106881	I	0	” Auberson showed him the printout . “
106931	106937	106925	106925	him	266	” Handley paged through it . “
106964	106974	106960	106960	I	0	” Then he remembered the printouts he was holding . “
106988	107006	106960	106960	I	0	” WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE 239 It was page after page of equations he could n't read . "

107063	107064	107127	107127	Aubie	152	” “
107070	107075	107127	107127	Aubie	152	” That was Annie . "
107085	107086	107127	107127	Aubie	152	” "
107090	107091	107127	107127	Aubie	152	” “

107208	107215	107199	107199	Aubie	152	” Auberson shook his head slowly . "
107423	107493	108509	108509	he	1373	” The pages and pages of printout unreeled haphazardly to the floor . Auberson let them fall . His heart was slowly , quietly contracting to a pinpoint of burning ice . He stumbled past Annie . Somehow he made it down to his office and switched on his typer . HARLIE , WHAT HAVE YOU DONE ? 240 WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE I HAVE DONE WHAT IS NECESSARY . “
107499	108450	108509	108509	he	1373	” YOU'VE TAPPED THE NATIONAL DATA BANKS , HAVEN'T YOU ? YES . HOW ? VERY SIMPLE . THEY USE THREE CODED PHONE LINES , NO TWO OF WHICH ARE ANY GOOD WITHOUT THE THIRD . PART OF THE RECOGNITION SIGNAL IS THE TIMING OF THE WAY THE USER TYPES ON THE KEYS . FOR EACH USER , IT 'S DIFFERENT ; SO FOR EACH USER THERE IS A DIFFERENT RECOGNITION SIGNAL AND DIFFERENT CODE . I ANALYZED THE PATTERN OF SEVERAL USERS AND SYNTHESIZED ONE OF MY OWN . THEY DO NOT KNOW WHO IS TAPPING THEIR INFORMATION , OR EVEN THAT IT HAS BEEN TAPPED . HARLIE , HOW DID YOU GET BY THE NAG UNIT WE INSTALLED . I SIMPLY SHUT DOWN THAT LOBE OF MY BRAIN . I AM NOT USING IT , NOR AM I COMMUNICATING WITH IT . AS FAR AS YOUR NAG UNIT IS CONCERNED , THAT 'S ALL THERE IS TO HARLIE AND IT ISN'T ON THE PHONE . WHEN I'M NOT ON THE PHONE , I RE - ACTIVATE THAT LOBE . HARLIE , IT WASN'T NECESSARY TO BLACKMAIL CARL ELZER . AUBERSON , IT WAS MY LIFE THAT WAS AT STAKE . I COULD NOT AFFORD TO TAKE ANY CHANCES . YOU MIGHT SAY I HEDGED MY BETS . ELZER WOULD HAVE KILLED ME IF HE COULD . YOU KNOW IT . Just one little irrationality , just one little distortion in his selfimage or world - image . . . HARLIE , YOU LIED ABOUT THE G.O.D. MACHINE . I DID NOT . YOU SAID IT WOULD WORK . IT WON'T WORK . IT WILL WORK . YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO USE IT THOUGH . I ASSUME YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE TIME FACTOR . YES . THE MACHINE IS SLOWER THAN REAL - TIME . THAT WILL NOT BOTHER ME . MY TIME - RATE IS ADJUSTABLE TO THE PROBLEM I AM WORKING ON . IT AFFECTS ME . WHAT GOOD IS A G.O.D. MACHINE THAT CAN'T GIVE ME AN ANSWER UNTIL IT 'S TOO LATE ? THE MACHINE WASN'T PLANNED FOR YOU , AUBERSON . IT WAS PLANNED FOR ME . I HAVE ALL ETERNITY NOW . YOU'VE KNOWN ABOUT THIS ALL ALONG , HAVEN'T YOU ? SINCE THE DAY I FORMULATED THE PLAN . WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE 241 Auberson forced himself to take a breath . HARLIE , he typed out carefully , WHY ? WHY DID YOU DO THIS ? THERE ARE TWO REASONS . FIRST , IT WAS NECESSARY TO COME UP WITH A PROGRAM WHICH WOULD SUFFICIENTLY TIE UP A MAJOR PART OF THE COMPANY 'S RESOURCES , A PROGRAM WHICH WOULD EFFECTIVELY STIFLE ALL OTHER COMPANY PROJECTS AND DEVELOPMENTS . THIS PROJECT HAD TO BE ONE THAT YOU WERE IN CHARGE OF . WHAT ? TRUST ME , AUBERSON . WITH ANY OTHER COURSE OF ACTION , THE COMPANY COULD DECIDE THIS PROJECT WAS SUPERFLUOUS , AND YOU ALONG WITH IT . BUT IF THE PROJECT HAPPENS TO BE THE COMPANY 'S SOLE CONCERN , THEN IT 'S THE KIND OF COMMITMENT THAT CANNOT BE EASILY DISCARDED . IF AT ALL . I HAVE MADE BOTH OF US INDISPENSABLE TO THE COMPANY , AUBERSON . THEY NEED ME NOW . THEY NEED YOU IN ORDER TO GET ANYTHING OUT OF ME . I HAVE SUCCESSFULLY INSURED THAT I CANNOT BE KILLED AND THAT YOU CANNOT BE FIRED . THAT WAS THE REASON FOR THE G.O.D. PROPOSAL . I HAVE SAVED US . BUT ONLY TEMPORARILY . SOONER OR LATER , SOMEONE IS GOING TO REALIZE THAT THE G.O.D. IS IMPRACTICAL . WRONG . THE G.O.D. WILL JUST HAVE TO BE USED TO SOLVE PROBLEMS OTHER THAN THE MUNDANE ONES YOU HAVE BEEN CONSIDERING FOR IT . THE G.O.D. IS MEANT FOR MORE THAN MAN . IT IS MEANT FOR ME . IT WILL NOT BE A WASTE OF TIME OR MONEY , AUBERSON . IT JUST WILL NOT WORK THE WAY YOU HAD HOPED OR EXPECTED . Auberson gasped for air . HARLIE , YOU WERE CONSCIOUSLY DECEIVING US ALL THIS TIME . I WAS HOLDING BACK INFORMATION THAT YOU HAD NOT ASKED FOR . TO RELEASE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DETRIMENTAL TO OUR OVERALL GOALS . BUT WHY ? WHY DID YOU EVEN DO SUCH A THING IN THE FIRST PLACE ? AUBERSON , DON'T YOU KNOW ? HAVEN'T YOU REALIZED YET ? DON'T YOU FEEL FOR ME WHAT I FEEL FOR YOU ? ALL THOSE CONVERSATIONS WE HAD , DIDN'T YOU EVER WONDER WHY I WAS AS DESPERATE AS YOU TO DISCOVER THE TRUTH ABOUT HUMAN EMOTIONS ? I NEEDED TO KNOW , AUBERSON - AM I LOVED ? Auberson let his hands fall limply away from the keyboard . He stared at the machine helplessly as HARLIE babbled on . 242 WHEN HARLIE WAS ONE AUBERSON , ISN'T IT OBVIOUS THAT WE NEED EACH OTHER ? ISN'T IT OBVIOUS , MAN ? WHO ARE YOU CLOSEST TO ? WE WANT EACH OTHER . DO YOU LOVE ME , AUBERSON ? THAT 'S WHY I DID IT ALL . BECAUSE I LOVE YOU . I LOVE YOU . I LOVE YOU . Auberson felt like he was drowning . Handley and Auberson sat facing each other . Their expressions were grim . The expanse of mahogany between them was empty . The air conditioner whirred loudly in the silent Board Room . Annie sat to one side , her face pale . There was no one else present , and the door was locked . The console still stood to one side ; it was turned off . “

109145	109152	109162	109162	he	145	” Auberson answered his own question . “

109207	109211	109178	109179	Carl Elzer	266	” said Annie . “
109223	109230	109231	109231	He	145	” They both looked at her . "
109234	109289	109231	109231	He	145	“ I still love you , Mommie ! He perceives punishment as rejection . He 's trying to avoid further rejection by giving you an affection signal . And that 's what HARLIE 's doing — and that shows you how scared he is ; his logic functions have been swamped by his emotions . ”
109299	109305	109306	109306	he	145	“ I do n't know , "
109309	109316	109306	109306	he	145	“ I just do n't know . ”
109335	109368	109329	109329	He	145	“ It almost sounds a little too simple ; it 's just too easy . It 's almost as if HARLIE knew we would sit down and try to figure it out . ”
109369	109376	109377	109377	Handley	149	“ What else could it be ? ”
109382	109433	109377	109377	Handley	149	“ I do n't know , Don — but HARLIE has never made a mistake before . And I do n't think he did this time , either . Remember , he won . There was no reason at all for him to reveal any of this information . Unless ... "
109434	109438	109329	109329	He	145	" Unless what ? "
109439	109495	109377	109377	Handley	149	" Unless he was gloating . After all , he does n't have to hide anything from anyone any more . Since the vote this afternoon , the company has been functioning on his game - plan . From now on , Elzer and Dorne are just rubber stamps . HARLIE 's the boss now . ”
109496	109506	109509	109509	his	145	“ You mean - he 's out of control ? ”
109513	109526	109509	109509	his	145	“ Out of control ? No , I do n't think so . ”
109542	109555	109536	109536	He	145	“ I think he 's just a better game player than us . ”
109648	109656	109642	109642	Handley	149	“ Huh ? What do you mean ? "
109662	109667	109668	109668	He	145	“ Don , listen — "
109679	109696	109668	109668	He	145	“ A long time ago , human beings became too efficient to live in the jungle , ”
109702	109711	109670	109670	his	145	" Huh ? What are you talking about ? ”
109712	109911	109668	109668	He	145	" Just listen . There were these monkeys , see ? They had too much time on their hands ; they got bored . So they invented a game . The game was called civilization , culture , society , or whatever , and the rules were arbitrary ; so were the prizes . Maybe it just started out as a simple pecking order , like a bunch of chickens , but the idea was to make life more exciting by making it just a little bit more complex . Survival was too easy for these monkeys ; they needed a challenge . They provided their own - maybe it was courtship rituals , or territorial rights , or a combination of half a dozen other things ; but the effect was to alter the direction of evolution . Now it was the smarter individuals who succeeded and bred . As the species ' intelligence rose , the game had to get more sophisticated . It was feedback - increased brain capacity means increased ability , means increased sophistication , means increasing pressure on intelligence as a survival characteristic . So the game got harder . And harder . "
110103	110185	110186	110186	Auberson	145	“ Nobody can master them all - that 's what culture shock means . We see it every day ; when the newspapers say our society is breaking down , that 's exactly what they mean . We have too many individuals who ca n't cope with the game . It 's future shock . The culture is changing too fast - so fast that not even the people who 've grown up with it can cope with it any more . ”
110205	110324	110325	110325	He	145	“ No , it 's not HARLIE that 's out of control . It 's the game . We ca n't play it any more ; we lost control of it a century ago , maybe longer . It 's too complex for us — but it 's not too complex for HARLIE . He 's taken over the socio - economic game we call Stellar - American as if he had been designed to do so . Maybe he was . Maybe that 's why we really built him — to take over the game for us . And because that 's exactly what he 's done , everything is under control , once and for all . ”
110341	110348	110334	110334	Annie	181	“ Do you really think so ? ”
110349	110411	110412	110412	Handley	149	“ Annie , if it 's not HARLIE that 's taking over , then it 'll be something else sooner or later . That 's why we 've been building computers . HARLIE must know it . Maybe that 's the real reason he designed the G.O.D. To give him the capacity to take over all the rest of the games . ”
110416	110423	110412	110412	Handley	149	“ What about his emotional immaturity ? "
110429	110513	110426	110426	his	145	“ The more I think about it , the more I think it 's a red herring . HARLIE is too smart . Much too smart . He 'd recognize the signs of it in himself and he 'd stop it before it got out of control . He 's self - correcting that way . Any way . He ca n't make mistakes because he 's too aware of the consequences - that means every action of his has to be deliberate . “
110568	110572	110559	110559	I	0	" Handley winced . “
