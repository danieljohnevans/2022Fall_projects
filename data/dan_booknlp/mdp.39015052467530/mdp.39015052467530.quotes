This is a hard age we live in , an ungrateful age . Things are n't as they were in our grandparents ' days , are they ? "

6206	6369	6203	6203	I	0	" Well , Mr. Ai , you 're not insane . I 'm not insane . But then neither of us is a king , you see ... I suppose that you intended to tell Argaven , rationally , that your mission here is to attempt to bring about an alliance between Gethen and the Ekumen . And , rationally , he knows that already ; because , as you know , I told him . I urged your case with him , tried to interest him in you . f It was ill done , ill timed . I forgot , being too interested myself , Il that he 's a king , and does not see things rationally , but as a king . as All I 've told him means to him simply that his power is threatened , his kingdom is a dustmote in space , his kingship is a joke to men who rule a hundred worlds . "
6370	6416	6132	6133	a king	870	" But the Ekumen does n't rule , it co - ordinates . Its power is precisely the power of its member states and worlds . In alliance with the Ekumen , Karhide will become infinitely less threatened and more important than its ever been . ”

6721	6829	6714	6714	I	0	“ I 'm afraid that Argaven also believes you . But he does not trust you . In part because he no longer trusts me . I have made mistakes , been careless . I can not ask for your trust any longer , either , having put you in jeopardy . I forgot what a king is , forgot that the king in his own eyes is Karhide , forgot what patriotism is and that he is , of necessity , the perfect patriot . Let me ask you this , Mr. Ai : do you know , by your own experience , what patriotism is ? "
6830	6833	6834	6834	I	0	" No , "
6852	6880	6834	6834	I	0	“ I do n't think I do . If by patriotism you do n't mean the love of one 's homeland , for that I do know . ”
6881	6980	6981	6981	He	895	" No , I do n't mean love , when I say patriotism . I mean fear . The fear of the other . And its expressions are political , not poetical : hate , rivalry , agression . It grows in us , that fear . It grows in us year by year . We 've followed our road too far , And you , who NEWS 13 THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS come from a world that outgrew nations centuries ago , who hardly know what I 'm talking about , who show us the new road "
7000	7045	6988	6988	he	895	" It 's because of fear that I refuse to urge your cause with the king , now . But not fear for myself , Mr. Ai . I 'm not acting patriotically . There are , after all , other nations on Gethen . "
7115	7184	7108	7108	he	895	“ If I 've understood you , your Ekumen is devoted essentially to the general interest of mankind . Now , for instance , the Orgota have experience in subordinating Hocal interests to a general interest , while Karhide has almost Inone .

Argaven snarled at him and he vanished . Still laughing and still snarling Argaven came up close and stared straight at me . The dark irises of his eyes glowed slightly orange . I was a good deal more afraid of him than I had expected to be . I could see no course to follow among these incoherencies but 23 THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS tool ? that of candor . I said , “

He kicked at the logs of the great fire till sparks whirled up thick in his face and fell on his hair and his black tunic , and he caught at them with open hands . Not tuming around he spoke in a shrill painful voice : "

Whole areas of that relationship were still blank to me , but I knew something about the competitive , prestige - seeking aspect of it , and about the perpetual conversational duel which can result from it .

Well , it may be the fact , but it 's a disgusting idea , Mr. Ai , and I do n't see why human beings here on earth should want or tolerate any dealings with creatures so monstrously different . But then , perhaps you 're here to tell me I have no choice in the matter . "

If I left Gethen now for the nearest world , Ollul , I 'd spend seventeen years of planetary time getting there . Timejumping is a function of traveling nearly as fast as light .

13345	13471	13183	13185	a bored king	1096	" Well , as you know , sir , I 'm not the first alien to come to 27 THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS Gethen . I was preceded by a team of Investigators , who did n't announce their presence , but passed as well as they could for Gethenians , and traveled about in Karhide and Orgoreyn and the Archipelago for a year . They left , and reported to the Councils of the Ekumen , over forty years ago , during your grandfather 's reign . Their report was extremely favorable . And so I studied the information they 'd gathered , and the languages they 'd recorded , and came . Would you like to see the device working , sir ? "
13472	13482	13312	13312	his	605	" I do n't like tricks , Mr. Ai . ”
13483	13499	13183	13185	a bored king	1096	" It 's not a trick , sir . Some of your own scientists have examined "
13500	13507	13183	13185	a bored king	1096	" I 'm not a scientist . ”
13508	13533	13534	13534	He	1098	" You 're a sovereign , my lord . Your peers on the Prime World of the Ekumen wait for a word from you . "
13564	13579	13580	13580	I	0	“ Very well . Ask your machine there what makes a man a traitor . "
13595	13612	13580	13580	I	0	“ King Argaven of Karhide asks the Stabiles on Hain what makes a man a traitor . ”
13692	13746	13931	13931	He	1100	“ To King Argaven of Karhide on Gethen , greetings . I do not know what makes a man a traitor . No man considers himself a traitor : this makes it hard to find out . Respectfully , Spimolle G. F. , for the Stabiles , in Saire on Hain , 93/1491/45 . "
13794	13930	13931	13931	He	1100	“ As useful an answer as I might get from any Foreteller . Answers are n't enough , Mr. Ai . Nor is your box , your machine there . Nor your vehicle , your ship . A bag of tricks and a trickster . You want me to believe you , your tales and messages . But why need I believe , or listen ? If there are eighty 28 THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS men thousand worlds full of monsters out there among the stars , what of it ? We want nothing from them . We 've chosen our way of life and have followed it for a long time . Karhide 's on the brink of a new epoch , a great new age . We 'll go our own way . ”
13970	14006	13966	13967	somebody else	1103	“ And if there were anything these Ekumens wanted from us , they would n't have sent you alone . It 's a joke , a hoax . Aliens would be here by the thousand . "
14007	14024	14084	14085	the king	605	“ But it does n't take a thousand men to open a door , my lord . ”
14025	14033	14084	14085	the king	605	" It might to keep it open . "
14034	14077	13966	13967	somebody else	1103	" The Ekumen will wait till you open it , sir . It will force nothing on you . I was sent alone , and remain here alone , in order to b uy make it impossible for you to fear me . "
14078	14082	14084	14085	the king	605	" Fear you ? "
14103	14240	14084	14085	the king	605	“ But I do fear you , Envoy . I fear l e , those who sent you . I fear liars , and I fear tricksters , and worst I fear the bitter truth . And so I rule my country well . Because pe only fear niles men . Nothing else works . Nothing else lasts long enough . You are what you say you are , yet you 're a joke , a hoax . There 's nothing in between the stars but void and terror and darkness , and you come out of that all alone trying to frighten : me . But I am already afraid , and I am the king . Fear is king Now take your traps and tricks and go , there 's no more needs saying . "
14253	15157	13966	13967	somebody else	1103	” So I departed from the royal presence - eck , eck , eck all down the long red floor in the red gloom of the hall , until at last the double doors shut me off from him . I had failed . Failed all around . What worried me as I left the King 's House and walked through the Palace grounds , however , was not my failure , but Estraven 's part in it . Why had the king exiled him for advocating the Ekumen 's cause ( which seemed to be the meaning of the proclamation ) if ( according to the king himself ) he had been doing the opposite ? When had he started advising the king to steer clear of me , and why ? Why was he exiled , and I let go free ? Which of them had lied more , and what the devil were they lying for ? Estraven to save his skin , I decided , and the king to save his face . The explanation was neat . But had Estraven , in fact , ever lied to me ? I discovered that I did not know . 29 THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS I was passing the Comer Red Dwelling . The gates of the garden stood open . I glanced in at the serem - trees leaning white above the dark pool , the paths of pink brick lying deserted in the serene gray light of afternoon . A little snow still lay in the shadow of the rocks by the pool . I thought of Estraven waiting for me there as the snow fell last night , and felt a pang of pure pity for the man whom I had seen in yesterday 's parade sweating and superb under the weight of his panoply and power , a man at the prime of his career , potent and magnificent - gone now , down , done . Running for the border with his death three days behind him , and no man speaking to him . The death - sentence is rare in Karhide . Life on Winter is hard to live , and people there generally leave death to nature or to anger , not to law . I wondered how Estraven , with that sentence driving him , would go . Not in a car , for they were all Palace property here ; would a ship or landboat give him passage ? Or was he afoot on the road , carrying what he could carry with him ? Karhiders go afoot , mostly ; they have no beasts of burden , no flying vehicles , the weather makes slow going for powered traffic most of the year , and they are not a people who hurry . I imagined the proud man going into exile step by step , a small trudging figure on the long road west to the Gulf . All this went through my mind and out of it as I passed the gate of the Comer Red Dwelling , and with it went my confused speculations concerning the acts and motives of Estraven and the king . I was done with them . I had failed . What next ? I should go to Orgoreyn , Karhide 's neighbor and rival . But once I went there I might find it hard to return to Karhide , and I had unfinished business here . I had to keep in mind that my entire life could be , and might well be , used in achieving my mission for the Ekumen . No hurry . No need to rush off to Orgoreyn before I had learned more about Karhide , particularly about the Fastnesses . For two years I had been answering questions , now I would ask some . But not in Erhenrang . I had finally understood that Estraven had been waring me , and though I might distrust his warning I could not disregard it . He had been saying , however indirectly , that I should get away from the city and the court . For some reason I thought of Lord Tibe 's teeth . ... The king had given me the freedom of the country ; I would avail myM ENTS 30 THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS self of it . As they say in Ekumenical School , when action grows unprofitable , gather information ; when information grows unprofitable , sleep . I was not sleepy , yet . I would go east to the Fastnesses , and gather information from the Foretellers , perhaps . 4 . The Nineteenth Day An East Karhidish story , as told in Gorinhering Hearth by Tobord Chorhawa , and recorded by G.A. , 93/1492 , LORD BEROSTY rem ir Ipe came to Thangering Fastness and of . fered forty beryls and half the year 's yield from his orchards as the price of a Foretelling , and the price was acceptable . He set his question to the Weaver Odren , and the question was , On what day shall I die ? The Foretellers gathered and went together into the darkness . At the end of darkness Odren spoke the answer : You will die on Odstreth ( the 19th day of any month ) . "
15167	15243	13966	13967	somebody else	1103	" cried Berosty , but the bond was broken , and there was no answer . He ran into the circle and took the Weaver Odren by the throat choking him and shouted that if he got no further answer he would break the Weaver 's neck . Others pulled him off and held him , though he was a strong man . He strained against their hands and cried out , . , 2 . “
15249	15253	13966	13967	somebody else	1103	” Odren said , “
15265	15450	15451	15451	I	0	" Raging then Berosty rem ir Ipe returned to Charuthe , the third Domain of his family , a poor place in northern Osnoriner , which he had made poorer in getting together the price of a Foretelling . He shut himself up in the strong - place , in the highest rooms of the Hearth - Tower , and would not come out for friend or foe , for seedtime or harvest , for kemmer or foray , all that month and the next and the next , and six months went by and ten months went 32 THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS ŚWA toot B2W4 in scierinces by , and he still kept like a prisoner to his room , waiting . On Onnetherhad and Odstreth ( the 18th and 19th days of the month ) he would not eat any food , nor would he drink , nor would he sleep . His kemmering by love and vow was Herbor of the Geganner clan . This Herbor came in the month of Grende to Thangering Fastness and said to the Weaver , “
15456	15457	15451	15451	I	0	" "
15464	15494	15460	15460	you	0	" Odren asked , for he saw that the man was poorly dressed and badly shod , and his sledge was old , and everything about him wanted mending . "
15501	15505	15495	15495	I	0	” said Herbor . "
15514	15527	15507	15507	you	0	" Odren asked him , speaking now as to a great nobleman , “
15533	15534	15535	15535	I	0	" "
15540	15544	15535	15535	I	0	” said Herbor . “

15579	15599	15600	15600	I	0	" Then Herbor fell on his knees , struck down by shame and love , and cried to Odren , “
15614	15615	15612	15612	myself	0	" "
15621	15626	15612	15612	myself	0	" asked the Weaver . "
15635	15644	15632	15633	Ashe Berosty	431	" said the man , and he wept . "
15672	15673	15675	15675	he	431	" “
15688	15707	15708	15708	I	0	" said the Weaver Odren . But Herbor 's passion moved him , and at length he said , “
15747	15912	15729	15729	bethink	432	" Then Herbor set Odren 's hands against his own eyes in sign of gratitude , and so the Foretelling went forward . The Foretellers gathered and went into the darkness . Herbor went among them and asked his question , and the question was , How long will Ashe Berosty rem ir Ipe live ? For Herbor thought thus to get the count of days or years , and so set his love 's heart at rest with certain knowledge . Then the Foretellers moved in the darkness and at last Odren cried in great pain , as if he burned in a fire , Longer than Herbor of Geganner ! It was not the answer Herbor had hoped , but it was the answer he got , and having a patient heart he went home to Charuthe with it , through the snows of Grende , He came into the Thenker pays whe price . But her of the moved him , leath "

15977	16014	15975	15975	Herbor	430	“ I have been to Thangering Fastness , and you have been answered by the Foretellers . I asked them how long you would live and their answer was , Berosty will live longer than QUHerbor . "
16035	16047	16015	16015	Berosty	431	“ Did you ask them when I would die , then ? "
16048	16057	15975	15975	Herbor	430	" I asked how long you would live . "
16058	16122	16123	16123	Berosty	431	" How long ? You fooll You had a question of the Foretellers , and did not ask them when I am to die , what day , month , year , how many days are left to me -- you asked how long ? O you fool , w you staring fool , longer than you , yes , longer than you ! "

Now you wo n't catch me crossing the Kargav , Erhenrang for me and a roof over my head .

You have to go back to the Old Land if you 're after the Old Way . Now look here , Mr. Ai , I 'll have a room in this island for you whenever you come back , but I believe you 're a wise man to be going out of Erhenrang for a while , for everybody knows that the Traitor made a great show of befriending you at the Palace .

I had decided to ask a yes - or - no question , which might at least make plain the extent and kind of obscurity or ambiguity in the answer . Faxe confirmed what Goss had said , that the matter of the question could be one of which the Foretellers were perfectly ignorant . I could ask if the hoolm crops would be good this year in the northern hemisphere of S , and they would answer , having no previous knowledge even of the existence of a planet called S. 44 THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS This seemed to put the business on the plane of pure chance divination , along with yarrow stalks and flipped coins . No , said Faxe , not at all , chance was not involved . The whole process was in fact precisely the reverse of chance . "

21473	21484	21485	21485	You	1344	" said Faxe , with his serene and candid smile . "

21519	21891	21510	21510	he	1110	” I chose a question to which I certainly lacked the answer . Only time could prove the Foretelling right or wrong , unless it was , as I expected , one of those admirable professional prophecies applicable to any outcome . It was not a trivial question ; I had given up the notion of asking when it would stop raining , or some such trifle , when I learned that the undertaking was a hard and dangerous one for the nine Foretellers of Otherhord . The cost was high for the asker - two of my rubies went to the coffers of the Fastness - but higher for the answerers . And as I got to know Faxe , if it became difficult to believe that he was a professional faker it became still more difficult to believe that he was an honest , self - deluded faker ; his intelligence was as hard , clear , and polished as my rubies . I dared set no trap for him . I asked what I most wanted to know . On Onnetherhad , the 18th of the month , the nine met together in a big building usually kept locked : one high hall , stonefloored and cold , dimly lighted by a couple of slit - windows and a fire in the deep hearth at one end . They sat on the bare stone in a circle , all of them cloaked and hooded , rough still shapes like a circle of dolmens in the faint glow of the fire yards away . Goss , and a couple of other young Indwellers , and a physician from the nearest Domain , watched in silence from seats by the hearth while I crossed the hall and entered the circle . It was all very informal , and very tense . One of the hooded figures looked up as I came amongst them , and I saw a strange face , coarsefeatured , heavy , with insolent eyes watching me . Faxe sat cross - legged , not moving , but charged , full of a gathering force that made his light , soft voice crack like an electric bolt . “
21894	21908	21510	21510	he	1110	” he said . I stood within the circle and asked my question . “
21935	21954	21924	21928	the Ekumen of Knowo Worlds	1349	" Silence . I stood there , I hung in the center of a spiderweb woven of silence . "
21959	22067	21924	21928	the Ekumen of Knowo Worlds	1349	" the Weaver said quietly . There was a relaxation . The hooded stones seemed to soften into movement ; the one who had looked so strangely at me began to whisper to his neighbor . I left the circle and joined the watchers by the hearth . Two of the Foretellers remained withdrawn , unspeaking . One of them lifted his left hand from time to time and patted the floor lightly and swiftly ten or twenty times , then sat motionless again . I had seen neither of them before ; they were the Zanies , Goss said . They were insane . Goss called them "
22072	22118	21924	21928	the Ekumen of Knowo Worlds	1349	" which may mean schizophrenics . Karhidish psychologists , though lacking mindspeech and thus like blind surgeons , were ingenious with drugs , hypnosis , spotshock , cryonic touch , and various mental therapies ; I asked if these two psychopaths could not be cured . "
22121	22125	22127	22127	you	1350	” Goss said . “
22135	22225	22226	22226	He	1351	" Five others of the circle were Indwellers of Otherhord , adepts in the Handdara disciplines of Presence and also , said Goss , so long as they remained Foretellers , celibate , taking no mate during their periods of sexual potency . One of these Celibates must be in kemmer during the Foretelling . I could pick him out , having learned to notice the subtle physical intensification , a kind of brightness , that signalizes the first phase of kemmer , Beside the kemmerer sat the Pervert . "
22235	22240	22226	22226	He	1351	" Goss told me . "
22283	22621	22273	22273	He	1351	" Goss used the pronoun that designates a male animal , not the pronoun for a human being in the masculine role of kemmer . He looked a little embarrassed . Karhiders discuss sexual matters freely , and talk about kemmer with both reverence and gusto , but they are reticent about discussing perversions — at least , they were with me . Excessive prolongation of the kemmer period , with permanent hormonal imbalance toward the male or the female , causes what they call perversion ; it is not rare ; three or four per- 46 THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS cent of adults may be physiological perverts or abnormals - normals , by our standard . They are not excluded from society , but they are tolerated with some disdain , as homosexuals are in many bisexual societies . The Karhidish slang for them is halfdeads . They are sterile . The Pervert of the group , after that first long strange stare at me , paid no heed to anyone but the one next to him , the kemmerer , whose increasingly active sexuality would be further roused and finally stimulated into full , female sexual capacity by the insistent , exaggerated maleness of the Pervert . The Pervert kept talking softly , leaning towards the kemmerer , who answered little and seemed to recoil . None of the others had spoken for a long time now , there was no sound but the whisper , whisper of the Pervert 's voice . Faxe was steadily watching one of the Zanies . The Pervert laid his hand quickly and softly on the kemmerer 's hand . The kemmerer avoided the touch hastily , with fear or disgust , and looked across at Faxe as if for help . Faxe did not move . The kemmerer kept his place , and kept still when the Pervert touched him again . One of the Zanies lifted up his face and laughed a long false crooning laugh , “
22631	23252	22273	22273	He	1351	" Faxe raised his hand . At once each face in the circle turned to him as if he had gathered up their gazes into a sheaf , a skein . It had been afternoon and raining when we entered the hall . The gray light had soon died out of the slit - windows under the eaves . Now whitish strips of light stretched like slanting phantasmal sails , long triangles and oblongs , from wall to floor , over the faces of the nine ; dull scraps and shreds of light from the moon rising over the forest , outside . The fire had burned down long since and there was no light but those strips and slants of dimness creeping across the circle , sketching out a face , a hand , a moveless back . For a while I saw Faxe 's profile rigid as pale stone in a diffuse dust of light . The diagonal of moonlight crept on and came to a black hump , the kemmerer , head bowed on his knees , hands clenched on the floor , body shaken by a regular tremor repeated by the slutter - pat - pat of the Zany 's hands on stone in darkness across the circle . They were all connected , all of them , as if they were the suspension - points of a spiderweb . I felt , whether I wished or not , the connection , the communication that ran , wordless , inarticulate , through Faxe , and which Faxe was tayot ing to pattern and control , for he was the center , the Weaver . THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS The dim light fragmented and died away creeping up the eastern wall . The web of force , of tension , of silence , grew . I tried to keep out of contact with the minds of the Foretellers . I was made very uneasy by that silent electric tension , by the sense of being drawn in , of becoming a point or figure in the patter , in the web . But when I set up a barrier , it was worse : I felt cut off and cowered inside my own mind obsessed by hallucinations of sight and touch , a stew of wild images and notions , abrupt visions and sensations all sexually charged and grotesquely violent , a red - and - black seething of erotic rage . I was surrounded by great gaping pits with ragged lips , vaginas , wounds , hellmouths , * I lost my balance , I was falling . . . . If I could not shut out this chaos I would fall indeed , I would go mad , and there was no shutting it out . The empathic and paraverbal forces at work , immensely powerful and confused , rising out of the perversion and frustration of sex , out of an insanity that distorts time , and out of an appalling discipline of total concentration and apprehension of immediate reality , were far beyond my restraint or control . And yet they were controlled : the center was still Faxe . Hours and seconds passed , the moonlight shone on the wrong wall , there was no moonlight only darkness , and in the center of all darkness Faxe : the Weaver : a woman , a woman dressed in light . The light was silver , the silver was armor , an armored woman with a sword . The light bumed sudden and intolerable , the light along her limbs , the fire , and she screamed aloud in terror and pain , "
23259	23268	22273	22273	He	1351	" The crooning laugh of the Zany began , “
23277	23329	22273	22273	He	1351	" and rose higher and higher into a wavering yell that went on and on , much longer than any voice could go on yelling , right across time . There was movement in the darkness , scuffling and shuffling , a redistribution of ancient centuries , an evasion of foreshadows . “
23334	23347	22273	22273	He	1351	" said an immense voice in vast syllables once or innumerable times . “
23360	23540	22273	22273	He	1351	” It was the physician from Spreve . He had entered the circle . It was all broken . He was kneeling by the Zanies , the frailest ones , the fusepoints ; both of them lay huddled up on the floor . The kemmerer lay with his head on Faxe 's knees , breathing in gasps , still trembling ; Faxe 's hand , with absent gentleness , stroked his hair . The Pervert was off by himself in a corner , sullen and dejected . The session was over , time passed as usual , the web of power had 48 THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS MUS I MWI fallen apart into indignity and weariness . Where was my answer , the riddle of the oracle , the ambiguous utterance of prophecy ? I knelt down beside Faxe . He looked at me with his clear eyes . For that instant I saw him as I had seen him in the dark , as a woman armed in light and burning in a fire , crying out , “
23542	23553	22273	22273	He	1351	” Faxe 's soft speaking - voice broke the vision . "
23560	23561	23555	23555	you	1356	" "
23568	23668	23566	23566	Weaver	428	" Indeed I was answered . Five years from now Gethen would be a member of the Ekumen : yes . No riddles , no hedging . Even then I was aware of the quality of that answery not so much a prophecy as an observation . I could not evade my own certainty that the answer was right . It had the imperative clarity of a hunch . We have NAFAL ships and instantaneous transmission and mindspeech , but we have n't yet tamed hunch to run in harness ; for that trick we must go to Gethen . "
23675	23688	23566	23566	Weaver	428	” Faxe said to me a day or two after the Foretelling . “

24383	24457	24840	24840	Faxe	449	" Well , look . For instance , this rivalry between Karhide and Orgoreyn , this quarrel about the Sinoth Valley . Karhide has lost face badly these last weeks , I gather . Now why did n't King Argaven consult his Foretellers , asking which course to take , or 50 THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS which member of the kyorremy to choose as prime minister , or something of that sort ? "
24458	24466	24840	24840	Faxe	449	" The questions are hard to ask . "
24467	24492	24840	24840	Faxe	449	" I do n't see why . He might simply ask , Who 'll serve me best as prime minister?—and leave it at that . "
24493	24544	24840	24840	Faxe	449	“ He might . But he does n't know what serving him best may mean . It might mean the man chosen would surrender the valley to Orgoreyn , or go into exile , or assassinate the king ; it might mean many things he would n't expect or accept . "
24545	24556	24840	24840	Faxe	449	" He 'd have to make his question very precise . "
24557	24578	24840	24840	Faxe	449	“ Yes . Then there 'd be many questions , you see . Even the king must pay the price . ”

26445	27508	26439	26439	I	0	” . things . I found no luck waiting for me at the harbor . No ship from Orgoreyn lay in port that I might board and so be off Karhide 's ground by midnight , as I was bound to be . Few men were on the wharves and those few all hurrying homeward ; the one I found to speak to , a fisherman mending the engine of his boat , looked once at me and tumed his back unspeaking . At that I was afraid . The man knew me ; he would not have known unwamed . Tibe had sent his hirelings to forestall me and keep me in Karhide till my time ran out . I had been busy with pain and rage , but not with fear , till now ; I had not thought that the Order of Exile might be 55 THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS mere pretext for my execution . Once Sixth Hour struck I was fair game for Tibe 's men , and none could cry Murder , but only Justice done . I sat down on a ballast - sack of sand there in the windy glare and darkness of the port . The sea slapped and sucked at the pilings , and fishing - boats jogged at their moorings , and out at the end of the long pier bumed a lamp . I sat and stared at the light and past it at darkness over the sea . Some rise to present danger , not I. My gift is forethought . Threatened closely I grow stupid , and sit on a bag of sand wondering if a man could swim to Orgoreyn . The ice has been out of Charisune Gulf for a month or two , one might stay alive a while in the water . It is a hundred and fifty miles to the Orgota shore . I do not know how to swim . When I looked away from the sea and back up the streets of Kuseben I found myself looking for Ashe in hopes he still was following me . Having come to that , shame pushed me out of stupor , and I was able to think . Bribery or violence was my choice if I dealt with that fisherman still at work in his boat in the inner dock : a faulty engine seemed not worth either . Theft , then . But the engines of fishing craft are locked . To bypass the locked circuit , start the engine , steer the boat out of dock under the pier - lamps and so off to Orgoreyn , having never run a motorboat , seemed a silly desperate venture . I had not run a boat but rowed one on Icefoot Lake in Kerm ; and there was a rowboat tied up in the outer dock between two launches . No sooner seen than stolen . I ran out the pier under the staring lamps , hopped into the boat , untied the painter , shipped the oars and rowed out onto the swelling harbor - water where the lights slipped and dazzled on black waves . When I was pretty well away I stopped rowing to reset the thole of one oar , for it was not working smoothly and I had , though I hoped to be picked up next day by an Orgota patrol or fisherman , a good bit of rowing to do . As I bent to the oarlock a weakness ran all through my body . I thought I would faint , and crouched back in a heap on the thwart . It was the sickness of cowardice overcoming me . But I had not known my cowardice lay so heavy in my belly . I lifted my eyes and saw two figures on the pier 's end like two jumping black twigs in the distant electric glare across - the water , and then I began to think that my paralysis was not an effect of terror , but of a gun at extreme range . 56 THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS I could see that one of them held a foray gun , and had it been past midnight I suppose he would have fired it and killed me ; but the foray gun makes a loud noise and that would want explaining . So they had used a sonic gun . At stun setting a sonic gun can locate its resonance - field only within a hundred feet or so . I do not know its range at lethal setting , but I had not been far out of it , for I was doubled up like a baby with colic . I found it hard to breathe , the weakened field having caught me in the chest . As they would soon have a powered boat out to come finish me off , I could not spend any more time hunched over my oars gasping . Darkness lay behind my back , before the boat , and into darkness I must row . I rowed with weak arms , watching my hands to make sure I kept hold of the oars , for I could not feel my grip . I came thus into rough water and the dark , out on the open Gulf . There I had to stop . With each oarstroke the numbness of my arms increased . My heart kept bad time , and my lungs had forgotten how to get air . I tried to row but I was not sure my arms were moving . I tried to pull the oars into the boat then , but could not . When the sweeplight of a harbor patrol ship picked me out of the night like a snowflake on soot , I could not even turn my eyes away from the glare . They unclenched my hands from the oars , hauled me up out of the boat , and laid me out like a gutted blackfish on the deck of the patrol ship . I felt them look down at me but could not well understand what they said , except for one , the ship 's master by his tone ; he said , “
27516	27523	26439	26439	I	0	" and again , answering another , “
27549	27624	27531	27532	The king	605	" So against radio commands from Tibe 's men ashore and against the arguments of his mate , who feared retribution , that officer of the Kuseben Patrol took me across the Gulf of Charisune and 1 set me ashore safe in Shelt Port in Orgoreyn . Whether he did this in shifgrethor against Tibe 's men who would kill an unarmed man , or in kindness , I do not know . Nusuth . “
27630	27763	27531	27532	The king	605	" I got up on my feet when the Orgota coast came gray out of the morning fog , and I made my legs move , and walked from the ship into the waterfront streets of Shelt , but somewhere there I fell down again . When I woke I was in the Commensal Hospital of Charisune Coastal Area Four , Twenty - fourth Commensality , 57 THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS Sennethny . I made sure of this , for it was engraved or embroidered in Orgota script on the headpiece of the bed , the lampstand by the bed , the metal cup on the bedtable , the bedtable , the nurses ' hiebs , the bedcovers and the bedshirt I wore . A physician came and said to me , “

When all that was settled to his satisfaction he told me I could leave in a day or two , and went on to the next bed . Behind him came the Inspector . Behind every man in Orgoreyn comes the Inspector , "

The Question of Sex From field notes of Ong Tot Oppong , Investigator , of the first Ekumenical landing party on Gethen / Winter , Cycle 93 E.Y. 1448 . 1448 day 81 . It seems likely that they were an experiment . The thought is unpleasant . But now that there is evidence to indicate that the Terran Colony was an experiment , the planting of one Hainish Normal group on a world with its own proto - hominid autochthones , the possibility can not be ignored . Human genetic manipulation was certainly practiced by the Colonizers ; nothing else explains the hilfs of S or the degenerate winged hominids of Rokanan ; will anything else explain Gethenian sexual physiology ? Accident , possibly ; natural selection , hardly . Their ambisexuality has little or no adaptive value.com Why pick so harsh a world for an experiment ? No answer . Tinibossol thinks the Colony was introduced during a major Interglacial . Conditions may have been fairly mild for their first 40 or 50,000 years here . By the time the ice was advancing again , the Hainish Withdrawal was complete and the Colonists were on their own , an experiment abandoned . I theorize about the origins of Gethenian sexual physiology . What do I actually know about it ? Otie Nim 's communication from the Orgoreyn region has cleared up some of my earlier misconceptions . Let me set down all I know , and after that my theories ; first things first . The sexual cycle averages 26 to 28 days ( they tend to speak 65 THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS of it as 26 days , approximating it to the lunar cycle ) . For 21 or 22 days the individual is somer , sexually inactive , latent . On about the 18th day hormonal changes are initiated by the pituitary control and on the 22nd or 23rd day the individual enters kemmer , estrus . In this first phase of kemmer ( Karh . secher ) he remains completely androgynous . Gender , and potency , are not attained in isolation . A Gethenian in first - phase kemmer , if kept alone or with others not in kemmer , remains incapable of coitus . Yet the sexual impulse is tremendously strong in this phase , controlling the entire personality , subjecting all other drives to its imperative . When the individual finds a partner in kemmer , hormonal secretion is further stimulated ( most importantly by touch - secretion ? scent ? ) until in one partner either a male or female hormonal dominance is established . The genitals engorge or shrink accordingly , foreplay intensifies , and the partner , triggered by the change , takes on the other sexual role ( ? without exception ? If there are exceptions , resulting in kemmer - partners of the same sex , they are so rare as to be ignored ) . This second phase of kemmer ( Karh . thorharmen ) , the mutual process of establishing sexuality and potency , apparently occurs within a time - span of two to twenty hours . If one of the partners is already in full kemmer , the phase for the newer partner is liable to be quite short ; if the two are entering kemmer together , it is likely to take longer . Normal individuals have no predisposition to either sexual role in kemmer ; they do not know whether they will be the male or the female , and have no choice in the matter . ( Otie Nim wrote that in the Orgoreyn region the use of hormone derivatives to establish a preferred sexuality is quite common ; I have n't seen this done in rural Karhide . ) Once the sex is determined it can not change during the kemmer - period . The culminant phase of kemmer ( Karh . thokemmer ) lasts from two to five days , during which sexual drive and capacity are at maximum . It ends fairly abruptly , and if conception has not taken place , the individual returns to the somer phase within a few hours ( note : Otie Nim thinks this "
31968	32274	31242	31242	His	1616	” is the equivalent of the menstrual cycle ) and the cycle begins anew . If the individual was in the female role and was impregnated , hormonal activity of course continues , and for the 8.4 - month gestation period and the 6- to 8 - month lactation period this individual remains female . The male sexual organs remain retracted ( as they are in somer ) , the breasts enlarge some 66 THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS LE what , and the pelvic girdle widens . With the cessation of lactation the female re - enters somer and becomes once more a perfect androgyne . No physiological habit is established , and the mother of several children may be the father of several more . Social observations : very superficial as yet ; I have been moving about too much to make coherent social observations . Kemmer is not always played by pairs . Pairing seems to be the commonest custom , but in the kemmerhouses of towns and cities groups may form and intercourse take place promiscuously among the males and females of the group . The furthest extreme from this practice is the custom of yowing kemmering ( Karh . oskyommer ) , which is to all intents and purposes monogamous marriage . It has no legal status , but socially and ethically is an ancient and vigorous institution . The whole structure of the Karhidish Clan - Hearths and Domains is indubitably based upon the institution of monogamous marriage . I am not sure of divorce rules in general ; here in Osnoriner there is divorce , but no remarriage after either divorce or the partner 's death : one can only vow kemmering once . Descent of course is reckoned , all over Gethen , from the mother , the "
32279	32764	31242	31242	His	1616	” ( Karh . amha ) . Incest is permitted , with various restrictions , between siblings , even the full siblings of a vowed - kemmering pair . Siblings are not however allowed to vow kemmering , nor keep kemmering after the birth of a child to one of the pair . Incest between generations is strictly forbidden ( in Karhide / Orgoreyn ; but is said to be permitted among the tribesmen of Perunter , the Antarctic Continent . This may be slander . ) . What else have I learned for certain ? That seems to sum it up . There is one feature of this anomalous arrangement that might have adaptive value . Since coitus takes place only during the period of fertility , the chance of conception is high , as with all mammals that have an estrous cycle . In harsh conditions where infant mortality is great , a race survival value may be indicated . At present neither infant mortality nor the birthrate runs high in the civilized areas of Gethen . Tinibossol estimates a population of not over 100 million on the three continents , and considers it to have been stable for at least a millennium . Ritual and ethical abstention and the use of contraceptive drugs seem to have played the major part in maintaining this stability . 67 THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS There are aspects of ambisexuality which we have only glimpsed or guessed at , and which we may never grasp entirely . The kemmer phenomenon fascinates all of us Investigators , of course . It fascinates us , but it rules the Gethenians , dominates them . The structure of their societies , the management of their industry , agriculture , commerce , the size of their settlements , the subjects of their stories , everything is shaped to fit the somerkemmer cycle . Everybody has his holiday once a month ; no one , whatever his position , is obliged or forced to work when in kemmer . No one is barred from the kemmerhouse , however poor or strange . Everything gives way before the recurring torment and festivity of passion . This is easy for us to understand . What is very hard for us to understand is that , four - fifths of the time , these people are not sexually motivated at all . Room is made for sex , plenty of room ; but a room , as it were , apart . The society of Gethen , in its daily functioning and in its continuity , is without sex . Consider : Anyone can turn his hand to anything . This sounds very simple , but its psychological effects are incalculable . The fact that everyone between seventeen and thirty - five or so is liable to be ( as Nim put it ) “
32770	32779	31242	31242	His	1616	” implies that no one is quite so thoroughly “
32782	33097	31242	31242	His	1616	” here as women , elsewhere , are likely to be - psychologically or physically . Burden and privilege are shared out pretty equally , everybody has the same risk to run or choice to make . Therefore nobody here is quite so free as a free male anywhere else . Consider : A child has 10 . psycho - sexual relationship to his mother and father . There is no myth of Oedipus.on Winter ... Consider : There is no unconsenting sex , no rape . As with most mammals other than man , coitus can be performed only by mutual invitation and consent ; otherwise it is not possible . Seduction certainly is possible , but it must have to be awfully well timed . Consider : There is no division of humanity into strong and weak halves , protective / protected , dominant / submissive , owner/ chattel , active / passive . In fact the whole tendency to dualism that pervades human thinking may be found to be lessened , or changed , on Winter . The following must go into my finished Directives : When you meet a Gethenian you can not and must not do what a bisexual THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS HERRA MENTE naturally does , which is to cast him in the role of Man or Woman , while adopting towards him a corresponding role dependent on your expectations of the patterned or possible interactions between persons of the same or the opposite sex . Our entire pattern of socio - sexual interaction is nonexistent here . They can not play the game . They do not see one another as men or women . This is almost impossible for our imagination to accept . What is the first question we ask about a newborn baby ? Yet you can not think of a Gethenian as “
33100	33116	31242	31242	His	1616	" They are not neuters . They are potentials , or integrals . Lacking the Karhidish "
33119	33129	33130	33130	he	1617	” used for persons in somer , I must say “
33132	33400	33130	33130	he	1617	" for the same reasons as we used the masculine pronoun in referring to a transcendent god : it is less defined less specifice than the neuter or the feminine . But the very use of the pronoun in my thoughts leads me continually to forget that the Karhider I am with is not a man , but a manwoman . The First Mobile , if one is sent , must be warned that unless he is very self - assured , or senile , his pride will suffer . A man wants his virility regarded , a woman wants her femininity appreciated , however indirect and subtle the indications of regard and appreciation . On Winter they will not exist . One is respected and judged only as a human being . It is an appalling experience . Back to my theory . Contemplating the motives for such an experiment , if such it was , and trying perhaps to exculpate our Hainish ancestors from the guilt of barbarism , of treating lives as things , I have made some guesses as to what they might have been after . The somer - kemmer cycle strikes us as degrading , a return to the estrous cycle of the lower mammals , a subjection of human beings to the mechanical imperative of rut . It is possible that the experimenters wished to see whether human beings lacking continuous sexual potentiality would remain intelligent and capable of culture . On the other hand , the limitation of the sexual drive to a discontinuous time - segment , and the “
33402	34496	31242	31242	His	1616	" of it in androgyny , must prevent , to a large extent , both the exploitation and the frustration of the drive . There must be sexual frustration ( though society provides as well as it can against it ; so long as the social unit is large enough that more than one person will be in kemmer at one time , sexual fulfillment is fairly certain ) , but at least it THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS can not build up ; it is over when kemmer is over . Fine ; thus they are spared much waste and madness ; but what is left , in somer ? What is there to sublimate ? What would a society of eunuchs achieve ? -But of course they are not eunuchs , in somer , but rather more comparable to pre - adolescents : not castrate , but latent . Another guess concerning the hypothetical experiment 's object : The elimination of war . Did the Ancient Hainish postulate that continuous sexual capacity and organized social aggression , neither of which are attributes of any mammal but man , are cause and effect ? Or , like Tumass Song Angot , did they consider war to be a purely masculine displacement - activity , a vast Rape , and therefore in their experiment eliminate the masculinity that rapes and the femininity that is raped ? God knows . The fact is that Gethenians , though highly competitive ( as proved by the elaborate social channels provided for competition for prestige , etc . ) seem not to be very aggressive ; at least they apparently have never yet had what one could call a war . They kill one another readily by ones and twos ; seldom by tens or twenties ; never by hundreds or thousands . Why ? It may turn out to have nothing to do with their androgyne psychology . There are not very many of them , after all . And there is the climate . The weather of Winter is so relentless , so near the limit of tolerability even to them with all their cold - adaptations , that perhaps they use up their fighting spirit fighting the cold . The marginal peoples , the races that just get by , are rarely the warriors . And in the end , the dominant factor in Gethenian life is not sex or any other human thing : it is their environment , their cold world . Here man has a crueler enemy even than himself . Lama woman of peaceful Chiffewar , and no expert on the attractions of violence or the nature of war . Someone else will have to think this out . But I really do n't see how anyone could put much stock in victory or glory after he had spent a winter on Winter , and seen the face of the Ice . 8 . Another Way into Orgoreyn I SPENT the summer more as an Investigator than a Mobile , going about the land of Karhide from town to town , from Domain to Domain , watching and listening - things a Mobile can not do at first , while he is still a marvel and monstrosity , and must be forever on show and ready to perform . I would tell my hosts in those rural Hearths and villages who I was ; most of them had heard a little about me over the radio and had a vague idea what I was . They were curious , some more , some less . Few were frightened of me personally , or showed the xenophobic revulsion . An enemy , in Karhide , is not a stranger , an invader . The stranger who comes unknown is a guest . Your enemy is your neighbor . During the month of Kus I lived on the Eastern coast in a ClanHearth called Gorinhering , a house - town - fort - farm built up on a hill above the eternal fogs of the Hodomin Ocean . Some five hundred people lived there . Four thousand years ago I should have found their ancestors living in the same place , in the same kind of house . Along in those four millennia the electric engine was developed , radios and power looms and power vehicles and farm ! machinery and all the rest began to be used , and a Machine Age got going , gradually , without any industrial revolution , without any revolution at all . Winter has n't achieved in thirty centuries what Terra once achieved in thirty decades . Neither has Winter ever paid the price that Terra paid . Winter is an inimical world ; its punishment for doing things wrong is sure and prompt : death from cold or death from hunger . No margin , no reprieve . A man can trust his luck , but a society ca n't ; and cultural change , like random mutation , may make 71 THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS things chancier . So they have gone very slowly . At any one point in their history a hasty observer would say that all technological progress and diffusion had ceased . Yet it never has . Compare the torrent and the glacier Both get where they are going . I talked a lot with the old people of Gorinhering , and also with the children . It was my first chance to see much of Gethenian children , for in Erhenrang they are all in the private or public Hearths and Schools . A quarter to a third of the adult urban population is engaged full time in the nurture and education of the children . Here the clan looked after its own ; nobody and everybody was responsible for them . They were a wild lot , chasing about over those fog - hidden hills and beaches . When I could round one up long enough to talk , I found them shy , proud , and immensely trustful . The parental instinct varies as widely on Gethen as anywhere . One ca n't generalize . I never saw a Karhider hit a child . I have seen one speak very angrily to a child . Their tenderness toward their children struck me as being profound , effective , and almost wholly unpossessive . Only in that unpossessiveness does it perhaps differ from what we call the “
34498	34658	33130	33130	he	1617	" instinct . I suspect that the distinction between a maternal and a paternal instinct is scarcely worth making ; the parental instinct , the wish to protect , to further , is not a sex - linked characteristic . .... Early in Hakanna we heard in Gorinhering on the static - fuzzed Palace Bulletin that King Argaven had announced his expectation of an heir . Not another kemmering - son , of which he already had seven , but an heir of the body , king - son . The king was pregnant , I found this funny , and so did the clansmen of Gorinhering , but for different reasons . They said he was too old to be bearing children , and they got hilarious and obscene on the subject . The old men went about cackling over it for days . They laughed at the king , but were not otherwise much interested in him . “
34664	34705	31242	31242	His	1616	” Estraven had said , and like so much Estraven had said it kept recurring to me as I learned more . The seeming nation , unified for centuries , was a stew of uncoordinated principalities , towns , villages , “
34711	35179	31242	31242	His	1616	" a sprawl and splatter of vigorous , competent , quarrelsome ( individualities over which a grid of authority was insecurely and I lightly laid . Nothing , I thought , could ever unite Karhide as a nation . Total diffusion of rapid communication devices , which is 72 THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS SES supposed to bring about nationalism almost inevitably , had not done so . The Ekumen could not appeal to these people as a social unit , a mobilizable entity : rather it must speak to their strong in my though undeveloped sense of humanity , of human unity . I got quite excited thinking about this . I was , of course , wrong ; yet I had learned something about Gethenians which in the long run proved to be useful knowledge . Unless I was to spend all year in Old Karhide I must retum to the West Fall before the passes of the Kargay closed . Even here on the coast there had been two light snowfalls in the last month of summer . Rather reluctantly I set off west again , and came to Erhenrang early in Gor , the first month of autumn . Argaven was now in seclusion in the summer - palace at Warrever , and had named Pemmer Harge rem ir Tibe as Regent during his confinement . Tibe was already making the most of his term of power . Within a couple of hours of my arrival I began to see the flaw in my analysis of Karhide — it was already out of date — and also be gan to feel uncomfortable , perhaps unsafe , in Erhenrang . Argaven was not sane ; the sinister incoherence of his mind darkened the mood of his capital ; he fed on fear . All the good of his reign had been done by his ministers and the kyorremy . But he had not done much harm . His wrestles with his own nightmares had not damaged the kingdom . His cousin Tibe was another kind of fish , for his insanity had logic . Tibe knew when to act , and how to act . Only he did not know when to stop . Tibe spoke on the radio a good deal . Estraven when in power had never done so , and it was not in the Karhidish vein : their government was not a public performance , normally ; it was covert and indirect . Tibe , however , orated . Hearing his voice on the air I saw again the long - toothed smile and the face masked with a net of fine wrinkles . His speeches were long and loud : praises of Karhide , disparagements of Orgoreyn , vilifications of “
35183	35187	31242	31242	His	1616	" discussions of the "
35195	35386	33130	33130	he	1617	" lectures in history and ethics and economics , all in a ranting , canting , emotional tone that went shrill with vituperation or adulation . He talked much about pride of country and love of the parentland , but little about shifgrethor , personal pride or prestige . Had Karhide lost so much prestige in the Sinoth Valley business that the subject could not be brought up ? No ; for he often talked about the Sinoth Valley . I decided that he was deliberately MONT E RRE RENA 73 THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS avoiding talk of shifgrethor because he wished to rouse emotions of a more elemental , uncontrollable kind . He wanted to stir up something which the whole shifgrethor - pattern was a refinement Jupon , a sublimation of . He wanted his hearers to be frightened ( and angry . His themes were not pride and love at all , though he used the words perpetually ; as he used them they meant self - praise and hate . He talked a great deal about Truth also , for he was , he said , “
35395	35581	33130	33130	he	1617	” It is a durable , ubiquitous , specious metaphor , that one about veneer ( or paint , or pliofilm , or whatever ) hiding the nobler reality beneath . It can conceal a dozen fallacies at once . One of the most dangerous is the implication that civilization , being artificial , is unnatural : that it is the opposite of primitiveness . ... Of course there is no veneer , the process is one of growth , and primitiveness and civilization are degrees of the same thing . If civilization has an opposite , it is war . Of those two things , you have either one , or the other . Not both . It seemed to me as I listened to Tibe 's dull fierce speeches that what he sought to do by fear and by persuasion was to force his people to change a choice they had made before their history began , the choice between those opposites . The time was ripe , perhaps . Slow as their material and technological advance had been , little as they valued "
35583	35826	33130	33130	he	1617	" in itself , they had finally , in the last five or ten or fifteen centuries , got a little ahead of Nature . They were n't absolutely at the mercy of their merciless climate any longer ; a bad harvest would not starve a whole province , or a bad winter isolate every city . On this basis of material stability Orgoreyn had gradually built up a unified and increasingly efficient centralized state . Now Karhide was to pull herself together and do the same ; and the way to make her do it was not by sparking her pride , or building up her trade , or improving her roads , farms , colleges , and so on ; none of that ; that 's all civilization , veneer , and Tibe dismissed it with scom . He was after something surer , the sure , quick , and lasting way to make people into a nation : war . His ideas concerning it could not have been too precise , but they were quite sound . The only other means of mobilizing people rapidly and entirely is with a new religion ; none was handy ; he would make do with war . I sent the Regent a note in which I quoted to him the question I had put to the Foretellers of Otherhord and the answer I had Perhe time was ripe , pestle as they valued "

37179	37863	37174	37174	Nusuth	450	" and left me . Two days later I took the road out of Erhenrang , the northwest road this time , afoot . My permission to enter Orgoreyn had arrived much sooner than the clerks and officials of the Orgota Embassy had led me to expect or had themselves expected ; when I went to get the papers they treated me with a sort of poisonous respect , resentful that protocol and regulations had , on some-1 body 's authority , been pushed aside for me . As Karhide had no regulations at all about leaving the country , I set straight off . Over the summer I had learned what a pleasant land Karhide was for walking in . Roads and inns are set for foot - traffic as well as for powered vehicles , and where inns are wanting one may count infallibly on the code of hospitality . Townsfolk of Co - Domains and the villagers , farmers , or lord of any Domain will give a traveler food and lodging , for three days by the code , and in practice for much 77 THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS longer than that ; and what 's best is that you are always received without fuss , welcomed , as if they had been expecting you to come . I meandered across the splendid slanting land between the Sess and the Ey , taking my time , working out my keep a couple of mornings in the fields of the great Domains , where they were getting the harvest in , every hand and tool and machine at work to get the golden fields cut before the weather tumed . It was all golden , all benign , that week of walking ; and at night before I slept I would step out of the dark farmhouse or firelit Hearth - Hall where I was lodged and walk a way into the dry stubble to look up at the stars , flaring like far cities in the windy autumn dark . In fact I was reluctant to leave this land , which I had found , though so indifferent to the Envoy , so gentle to the stranger . I dreaded starting all over , trying to repeat my news in a new language to new hearers , failing again perhaps . I wandered more north than west , justifying my course by a curiosity to see the Sinoth Valley region , the locus of the rivalry between Karhide and Orgoreyn . Though the weather held clear it began to grow colder , and at last I turned west before I got to Sassinoth , remembering that there was a fence across that stretch of border , and I might not be so easily let out of Karhide there . Here the border was the Ey , a narrow river but fierce , glacier - fed like all rivers of the Great Continent . I doubled back a few miles south to find a bridge , and came on one linking two little villages , Passerer on the Karhide side and Siuwensin in Orgoreyn , staring sleepily at each other across the noisy Ey . The Karhidish bridge - keeper asked me only if I planned to retum that night , and waved me on across . On the Orgota side an Inspector was called out to inspect my passport and papers , which he did for about an hour , a Karhidish hour at that . He kept the passport , telling me I must call for it next morning , and gave me in place of it a permiso for meals and lodging at the Commensal Transient - House of Siuwensin . I spent another hour in the office of the superintendent of the Transient - House , while the superintendent read my papers and checked on the authenticity of my permiso by telephoning the Inspector at the Commensal BorderStation from which I had just come . I ca n't properly define that Orgota word here translated as "

37895	37959	37881	37893	another h intendent perintendent of the 78 THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS gether	1661	” Its usage includes all national / governmental institutions of Orgoreyn , from the State as a whole through its thirty - three component substates or Districts to the sub - substates , townships , communal farms , mines , factories , and so on , that compose these . As an adjective it is applied to all the above ; in the form "
37962	38709	37881	37893	another h intendent perintendent of the 78 THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS gether	1661	” it usually means the thirty - three Heads of Districts , who form the governing body , executive and legislative , of the Great Commensality of Orgoreyn , but it may also mean the citi , zens , the people themselves . In this curious lack of distinction be tween the general and specific applications of the word , in the use of it for both the whole and the part , the state and the individual , in this imprecision is its precisest meaning . My papers and my presence were at last approved , and by Fourth Hour I got my first meal since early breakfast - supper : kadik - porridge and cold sliced breadapple . For all its array of officials , Siuwensin was a very small , plain place , sunk deep in rural torpor . The Commensal Transient - House was shorter than its name . Its dining - room had one table , five chairs , and no fire ; food was brought in from the village hot - shop . The other room was the dormitory : six beds , a lot of dust , a little mildew . I had it to myself . As everybody in Siuwensin appeared to have gone to bed directly after supper , I did the same . I fell asleep in that utter country silence that makes your ears ring . I slept an hour and woke in the grip of a nightmare about explosions , invasion , murder , and conflagration . It was a particularly bad dream , the kind in which you run down a strange street in the dark with a lot of people who have no faces , while houses go up in flames behind you , and children scream . I ended up in an open field , standing in dry stubble by a black hedge . The dull - red halfmoon and some stars showed through clouds overhead . The wind was bitter cold . Near me a big barn or granary bulked up in the dark , and in the distance beyond it I saw little volleys of sparks going up on the wind . I was bare - legged and barefoot , in my shirt , without breeches , hieb , or coat ; but I had my pack . It held not only spare clothes but also my rubies , cash , documents , papers , and ansible , and I slept with it as a pillow when I traveled . Evidently I hung onto it even during bad dreams . I got out shoes and breeches and my furlined winter hieb , and dressed , there in the cold , dark country silence , THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS while Siuwensin smoldered half a mile behind me . Then I struck out looking for a road , and soon found one , and on it , other people . They were refugees like me , but they knew where they were going . I followed them , having no direction of my own , except away from Siuwensin ; which , I gathered as we walked , had been raided by a foray from Passerer across the bridge . They had struck , set fire , withdrawn ; there had been no fight . But all at once lights glared down the dark at us , and scuttling to the roadside we watched a land - caravan , twenty trucks , come at top speed out of the west toward Siuwensin and pass us with a flash of light and a hiss of wheels twenty times repeated ; then silence and the dark again . We soon came to a communal farm - center , where we were halted and interrogated . I tried to attach myself to the group I had followed down the road , but no luck ; no luck for them either , if they did not have their identification - papers with them . They , and I as a foreigner without passport , were cut out of the herd and given separate quarters for the night in a storage - bar , a vast stone semi - cellar with one door locked on us from outside , and no window . Now and then the door was unlocked and a new refugee thrust in by a farm - policeman armed with the Gethenian sonic "
38712	38872	37881	37893	another h intendent perintendent of the 78 THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS gether	1661	" The door shut , it was perfectly dark : no light . One 's eyes , cheated of sight , sent starbursts and fiery blots whirling through the black . The air was cold , and heavy with the dust and odor of grain . No one had a handlight ; these were people who had been routed out of their beds , like me ; a couple of them were literally naked , and had been given blankets by others on the way . They had nothing . If they had had anything , it would have been their papers . Better to be naked than to lack papers , in Orgoreyn . They sat dispersed in that hollow , huge , dusty blindness . Some times two conversed a while , low - voiced . There was no fellowfeeling of being prisoners together . There was no complaint . I heard one whisper to my left : “
38890	38891	38892	38892	They	1664	” “

38939	39118	38917	38918	Ovord Domain	480	" They did not understand ; they did not complain . They did not protest being locked up in a cellar by their fellow - citizens after 80 THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS dext SRI 2 having been shot and bumed out of their homes . They sought no reasons for what had happened to them . The whispers in the dark , random and soft , in the sinuous Orgota language that made Karhidish sound like rocks rattled in a can , ceased little by little . People slept . A baby fretted a while , away off in the dark , crying at the echo of its own cries . The door squealed open and it was broad day , sunlight like a knife in the eyes , bright and frightening . I stumbled out behind the rest and was mechanically following them when I heard my name . I had not recognized it ; for one thing the Orgota could say l. Someone had been calling it at intervals ever since the door was unlocked . "
39127	39235	39124	39125	Mr. Ai	384	" said a hurried person in red , and I was no longer a refugee . I was set apart from those nameless un ones with whom I had fled down a dark road and whose lack of se identity I had shared all night in a dark room . I was named , known , recognized ; I existed . It was an intense relief . I followed Y my leader gladly . The office of the Local Commensal Farm Centrality was hectic and upset , but they made time to look after me , and apologized to me for the discomforts of the night past . “
39249	39255	39124	39125	Mr. Ai	384	” lamented one fat Inspector , "
39265	40430	40431	40432	Not Ambassador	1667	” They did not know who I was or why I was to be given particular treatment ; their ignorance was evident , but made no difference . Genly Ai , the Envoy , was to be treated as a distinguished person . He was . By mid - afternoon I was on my way to Mishnory in a car put at my disposal by the Commensal Farm Centrality of East Homsvashom , District Eight . I had a new passport , and a free pass to all Transient Houses on my road , and a telegraphed invitation to the Mishnory residence of the First Commensal District Commissioner of Entry - Roads and Ports , Mr. Uth Shusgis . The radio of the little car came on with the engine and ran while the car did ; so all afternoon as I drove through the great level grainlands of East Orgoreyn , fenceless ( for there are no herdbeasts ) and full of streams , I listened to the radio . It told me about the weather , the crops , road - conditions ; it cautioned me to drive carefully ; it gave me various kinds of news from all thirtythree Districts , the output of various factories , the shippinginformation from various sea and river ports ; it singsonged some 81 THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS Yomesh chants , and then told me about the weather again . It was all very mild , after the ranting I had heard on the radio in Erhenrang . No mention was made of the raid on Siuwensin ; the Orgota government evidently meant to prevent , not rouse , excitement . A brief official bulletin repeated every so often said simply that order was being and would be maintained along the Eastern Border . I liked that ; it was reassuring and unprovocative , and had the quiet toughness that I had always admired in Gethenians : Order will be maintained . ... I was glad , now , to be out of Karhide , an incoherent land driven towards violence by a paranoid , pregnant king and an egomaniac Regent . I was glad to be driving sedately at twenty - five miles an hour through vast , straightfurrowed grainlands , under an even gray sky , towards a capital whose government believed in Order . The road was posted frequently ( unlike the signless Karhidish roads on which you had to ask or guess your way ) with directions to prepare to stop at the Inspection - Station of such - and - such Commensal Area or Region ; at these internal customs - houses one 's identification must be shown and one 's passage recorded . My papers were valid to all examination , and I was politely waved on after minimal delay , and politely advised how far it was to the next Transient - House if I wanted to eat or sleep . At 25 mph it is a considerable journey from the North Fall to Mishnory , and I spent two nights on the way . Food at the Transient - Houses was dull but plentiful , lodging decent , lacking only privacy . Even that was supplied in some measure by the reticence of my fellow travelers . I did not strike up an acquaintance or have a real conversation at any of these halts , though I tried several times . The Orgota seemed not an unfriendly people , but incurious ; they were colorless , steady , subdued . I liked them . I had had two years of color , choler , and passion in Karhide . A change was welcome . Following the east bank of the great River Kunderer I came on my third moming in Orgoreyn to Mishnory , the largest city on that world . In the weak sunlight between autumn showers it was a queerlooking city , all blank stone walls with a few narrow windows set too high , wide streets that dwarfed the crowds , street - lamps perched on ridiculous tall posts , roofs pitched steep as praying hands , shed - roofs sticking out of housewalls eighteen feet above ground like big aimless bookshelves — an ill - proportioned , gro- 82 THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS tesque city , in the sunlight . It was not built for sunlight . It was built for winter . In winter , with those streets filled ten feet up with packed , hard - rolled snow , the steep roofs icicle - fringed , sleds parked under the shed - roofs , narrow window - slits shining yellow through driving sleet , you would see the fitness of that city , its economy , its beauty . Mishnory was cleaner , larger , lighter than Erhenrang , more open and imposing . Great buildings of yellowish - white stone dominated it , simple stately blocks all built to a pattern , housing the offices and services of the Commensal Government and also the major temples of the Yomesh cult , which is promulgated by the Commensality . There was no clutter and contortion , no sense of always being under the shadow of something high and gloomy , as in Erhenrang , everything was simple , grandly conceived , and orderly . I felt as if I had come out of a dark age , and wished I had not wasted two years in Karhide . This , now , looked like a country ready to enter the Ekumenical Age . I drove about the city a while , then returned the car to the proper Regional Bureau and went on foot to the residence of the First Commensal District Commissioner of Entry - Roads and Ports . I had never made quite sure whether the invitation was a request or a polite command . Nusuth . I was in Orgoreyn to speak for the Ekumen , and might as well begin here as anywhere . My notions of Orgota phlegm and self - control were spoiled by Commissioner Shusgis , who advanced on me smiling and shouting , grabbed both my hands in the gesture which Karhiders reserve for moments of intense personal emotion , pumped my arms up and down as if trying to start a spark in my engine , and bellowed a greeting to the Ambassador of the Ekumen of the Known Worlds to Gethen , That was a surprise , for not one of the twelve or fourteen Inspectors who had studied my papers had shown any sign of recognizing my name or the terms Envoy or Ekumen - all of which had been at least vaguely familiar to all Karhiders I had met . I had decided that Karhide had never let any broadcasts concerning me be used on Orgota stations , but had tried to keep me a national secret . "

A high official and wealthy man , he lived in a style that has no equivalent in Karhide , even among lords of great Domains . Shusgis ' house was a whole island , housing over a hundred employees , domestic servants , clerks , technical advisers , and so on , but no relatives , no kinfolk . The system of extended - family clans , of Hearths and Domains , though still vaguely discernible in the Commensal structure , was “

There is ho rank by descent . Private wills are not legal : a man dying leaves his fortune to the state . All start equal . But obviously they do n't go on so . Shusgis was rich , and liberal with his riches . There were luxuries in my rooms that I had not known existed on Winter - for instance , a shower . There was an electric heater as well as a wellstocked fireplace . Shusgis laughed : “

He seemed disinclined to talk with me , and I was glad not to talk with him . Yet now and then during that long , heavy , talkative supper - party , though all my attention was given to those complex and powerful Orgota who meant to be friend or use me , I was sharply aware of him : of his silence : of his dark averted face . And it crossed my mind , though I dismissed the idea as baseless , that I had not come to Mishnory to eat roast blackfish with the Commensals of my own free will ; nor had they brought me here . He had . 9 . Estraven the Traitor An East Karhidish tale , as told in Gorinhering by Tobord Chorhawa and recorded by G.A. The story is well known in various versions , and a "
42899	43497	43498	43498	I	0	" play based on it is in the repertory of traveling players east of the Kargav . LONG AGO , before the days of King Argaven I who made Karhide one kingdom , there was blood feud between the Domain of Stok and the Domain of Estre in Kerm Land . The feud had been fought in forays and ambushes for three generations , and there was no settling it , for it was a dispute over land . Rich land is scarce in Kerm , and a Domain 's pride is in the length of its borders , and the lords of Kerm Land are proud men and umbrageous men , casting black shadows . It chanced that the heir of the flesh of the Lord of Estre , a young man , skiing across Icefoot Lake in the month of Irrem hunting pesthry , came onto rotten ice and fell into the lake . Though by using one ski as a lever on a firmer ice - edge he pulled himself up out of the water at last , he was in almost as bad case out of the lake as in it , for he was drenched , the air was kurem , * and night was coming on . He saw no hope of reaching Estre eight miles away uphill , and so set off towards the village of Ebos on the north shore of the lake . As night fell the fog flowed down off the glacier and spread out all across the lake , so that he could not see his way , nor where to set his skis . Slowly he went for fear of rotten ice , yet in haste , because the cold was at his bones and before long * Kurem , damp weather , oº to — 20 ° F. 89 THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS drove out the sale to drink.cared for him.ed at each he would not be able to move . He saw at last a light before him in the night and fog . He cast off his skis , for the lakeshore was rough going and bare of snow in places . His legs would not well hold him up any more , and he struggled as best he could to the light . He was far astray from the way to Ebos . This was a small house set by itself in a forest of the thore - trees that are all the woods of Kerm Land , and they grew close all about the house and no taller than its roof . He beat at the door with his hands and called aloud , and one opened the door and brought him into firelight . There was no one else there , only this one person alone . He took Estraven 's clothes off him that were like clothes of iron with the ice , and put him naked between furs , and with the warmth of his own body drove out the frost from Estraven 's feet and hands and face , and gave him hot ale to drink . At last the young man was recovered , and looked on the one who cared for him . This was a stranger , young as himself . They looked at each other . Each of them was comely , strong of frame and fine of feature , straight and dark , Estraven saw that the fire of kemmer was in the face of the other . He said , “

43554	43614	43532	43532	you	185	" He put out his hand and touched Estraven 's hand , as if he were making certain that the frost was driven out . At the touch , though Estraven was a day or two from his kemmer , he felt the fire waken in himself . So for a while both held still , their hands touching . “
43620	43663	43615	43615	They	1732	” said Stokven , and laying his palm against Estraven 's showed it was so : their hands were the same in length and form , finger by finger , matching like the two hands of one man laid palm to palm . “
43671	43675	43668	43668	you	1733	" Stokven said . "
43681	43701	43678	43679	mortal enemies	1735	” He rose , and built up the fire in the hearth , and returned to sit by Estraven . “
43707	43711	43704	43705	mortal enemies	1735	" said Estraven . “
43719	43720	43712	43712	I	0	" "
43726	43861	43722	43722	I	0	" said the other . Then they vowed kemmering 00 THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS to each other , and in Kerm Land then as now that vow of faithfulness is not to be broken , not to be replaced . That night , and the day that followed , and the night that followed , they spent in the hut in the forest by the frozen lake . On the next morning a party of men from Stok came to the hut . One of them knew young Estraven by sight . He said no word and gave no waming but drew his knife , and there in Stokven 's sight stabbed Estraven in the throat and chest , and the young man fell across the cold hearth in his blood , dead . "
43869	43877	43862	43862	He	1737	" the murderer said . Stokven said , "
43892	43956	43862	43862	He	1737	” He went back to Stok . The men set off with Estraven 's body on the sledge , but they left it far in the thore - forest for wild beasts to eat , and returned that night to Stok . Therem stood up before his parent in the flesh , Lord Harish rem ir Stokven , and said to the men , “
43965	43969	43958	43958	you	1739	” They answered , “
43972	43976	43977	43977	You	1739	” Therem said , “
44009	44142	44004	44004	I	0	” Lord Harish granted it , and they were driven out of hearth and law . Soon after this Therem left his Domain , saying that he wished to indwell at Rotherer Fastness for a time , and he did not retum to Stok until a year had passed . Now in the Domain of Estre they sought for Arek in mountain and plain , and then moumed for him : bitter the mourning through summer and autumn , for he had been the lord 's one child of the flesh . But in the end of the month Them when winter lay heavy on the land , a man came up the mountainside on skis , and gave to the warder at Estre Gate a bundle wrapped in furs , saying , “
44154	44606	44145	44145	Therem	460	” Then he was down the mountain on his skis like a rock skipping over water , gone before any thought to hold him . In the bundle of furs lay a newbom child , weeping . They brought the child in to Lord Sorve and told him the stranger 's words ; and the old lord full of grief saw in the baby his lost son Arek . He ordered that the child be reared as a son of the Inner Hearth , and that he be called Therem , though that was not a name ever used by the clan of Estre . The child grew comely , fine and strong ; he was dark of nature 91 THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS and silent , yet all saw in him some likeness to the lost Arek . When he was grown Lord Sorve in the willfulness of old age named him heir of Estre . Then there were swollen hearts among Sorve 's kemmering - sons , all strong men in their prime , who had waited long for lordship . They laid ambush against young Therem when he went out alone hunting pesthry in the month of Irrem . But he was armed , and not taken unawares . Two of his hearth - brothers he shot , in the fog that lay thick on Icefoot Lake in the thawweather , and a third he fought with , knife to knife , and killed at last , though he himself was wounded on the chest and neck with deep cuts . Then he stood above his brother 's body in the mist over the ice , and saw that night was falling . He grew sick and weak as the blood ran from his wounds , and he thought to go to Ebos village for help ; but in the gathering dark he went astray , and came to the thore - forest on the east shore of the lake . There seeing an abandoned hut he entered it , and too faint to light a fire he fell down on the cold stones of the hearth , and lay so with his wounds unstanched . One came in out of the night , a man alone . He stopped in the doorway and was still , staring at the man who lay in his blood across the hearth . Then he entered in haste , and made a bed of furs that he took out of an old chest , and built up a fire , and cleaned Therem 's wounds and bound them . When he saw the young man look at him he said , “
44613	44614	44615	44615	I	0	" "
44621	44638	44615	44615	I	0	" There was silence a while between them . Then the young man smiled and said , “
44653	44654	44640	44640	you	0	" "
44657	44666	44640	44640	you	0	" said the older one . Estraven asked , “
44686	44687	44672	44672	you	0	" "
44693	44739	44688	44688	I	0	" Stokven replied . He felt the young man 's pulse and hand for fever , and for an instant laid his palm flat to Estraven 's palm ; and finger by finger their two hands matched , like the two hands of one man . “
44745	44752	44740	44740	We	1746	" said Stokven . Estraven answered , “
44766	44773	44763	44763	you	0	" Stokven turned aside his face . "
44782	44786	44775	44775	I	0	" he said . “
44797	44807	44808	44808	I	0	" 92 THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS Estraven said , “
44815	45000	44808	44808	I	0	” So they made that vow , and then spoke no more , and the hurt man slept . In the moming Stokven was gone , but a party of people from Ebos village came to the hut and carried Estraven home to Estre . There none dared longer oppose the old lord 's will , the rightness of which was written plain in three men 's blood on the lake - ice ; and at Sorve 's death Therem became Lord of Estre . Within the year he ended the old feud , giving up half the disputed lands to the Domain of Stok . For this , and for the murder of his hearth - brothers , he was called Estraven the Traitor . Yet his name , Therem , is still given to children of that Domain . 10 . Conversations in Mishnory NEXT MORNING as I finished a late breakfast served to me in my suite in Shusgis ' mansion the house - phone emitted a polite bleat , When I switched it on , the caller spoke in Karhidish : "
45010	45011	45006	45006	I	0	" "
45015	45188	45006	45006	I	0	" I was glad to get the confrontation over with at once . It was plain that no tolerable relationship could exist between Estraven and myself . Even though his disgrace and exile were at least nominally on my account , I could take no responsibility for them , feel no rational guilt ; he had made neither his acts nor his motives clear to me in Erhenrang , and I could not trust the fellow . I wished that he was not mixed up with these Orgota who had , as it were , adopted me . His presence was a complication and an embarrassment . He was shown into the room by one of the many houseemployees . I had him sit down in one of the large padded chairs , and offered him breakfast - ale . He refused . His manner was not constrained — he had left shyness a long way behind him if he ever bad any — but it was restrained : tentative , aloof . “
45194	45208	45006	45006	I	0	" he said , and seeing my glance at the heavily curtained window , “
45216	45263	45209	45209	You	1751	" I did so , and saw snow whirling thick on a light wind down the street , over the whitened roofs ; two or three inches had fallen in the night . It was Odarhad Gor , the 17th of the first month of autumn . “
45268	45282	45283	45283	They	1752	" I said , caught by the snow - spell for a moment . “
45291	45348	45283	45283	They	1752	" I left the curtains drawn back . The bleak even light from out- 94 THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS side fell on his dark face . He looked older . He had known some hard times since I saw him last in the Comer Red Dwelling of the Palace in Erhenrang by his own fireside . "
45360	45516	45353	45353	I	0	" I said , and gave him the foilskin - wrapped packet of money , which I had set out on a table ready after his call . He took it and thanked me gravely . I had not sat down . After a moment , still holding the packet , he stood up . My conscience itched a little , but I did not scratch it . I wanted to discourage him from coming to me . That this involved humiliating him was unfortunate . He looked straight at me . He was shorter than I , of course , short - legged and compact , not as tall even as many women of my race . Yet when he looked at me he did not seem to be looking up at me . I did not meet his eyes . I examined the radio on the table with a show of abstracted interest . "
45530	45535	45522	45522	one	627	" he said pleasantly . “
45559	45560	45600	45600	Karhidish	400	” “
45575	45576	45565	45573	a number of people quite ready to supply it	1756	" "
45605	45612	45602	45602	I	0	" He went on in Orgota , “
45697	45731	45732	45732	You	384	” He paused ; I said nothing . I had never heard him use this sort of harsh , elaborate courtesy , and had no idea what it signified . He went on , “
45814	45833	45781	45781	I	0	” He stopped . I was about to demand that he be more specific , but he said , "
45839	46326	45836	45837	Mr. Ai	384	" turned , and left . I stood be 95 THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS you . numbed . The man was like an electric shock - nothing to hold on to and you do n't know what hit you . He had certainly spoiled the mood of peaceful selfcongratulation in which I had eaten breakfast . I went to the narrow window and looked out . The snow had thinned a little . It was beautiful , drifting in white clots and clusters like a fall of cherry - petals in the orchards of my home , when a spring wind blows down the green slopes of Borland , where I was bom : on Earth , warm Earth , where trees bear flowers in spring . All at once I was utterly downcast and homesick . Two years I had spent on this damned planet , and the third winter had begun before autumn was underway - months and months of unrelenting cold , sleet , ice , wind , rain , snow , cold , cold inside , cold outside , cold to the bone and the marrow of the bone . And all that time on my own , alien and isolate , without a soul I could trust . Poor Genly , shall we cry ? I saw Estraven come out of the house onto the street below me , a dark foreshortened figure in the even , vague gray - white of the snow . He looked about , adjusting the loose belt of his hieb - he wore no coat . He set off down the street , walking with a deft , definite grace , a quickness of being that made him seem in that minute the only thing alive in all Mishnory . I turned back to the warm room . Its comforts were stuffy and cloddish , the heater , the padded chairs , the bed piled with furs , the rugs , drapes , wrappings , mufilings . I put on my winter coat and went out for a walk , in a disagree able mood , in a disagreeable world . I was to lunch that day with Commensals Obsle and Yegey and others I had met the night before , and to be introduced to some I had not met . Lunch is usually served from a buffet and eaten standing up , perhaps so that one will not feel he has spent the entire day sitting at table . For this formal affair , however , places were set at table , and the buffet was enormous , eighteen or twenty hot and cold dishes , mostly variations on sube - eggs and breadapple . At the sideboard , before the taboo on conversation applied , Obsle remarked to me while loading up his plate with batter - fried sube - eggs , “
46351	46415	46341	46346	an open agent of the Sarf	1766	" He spoke conversationally , laughed as if I had made an amusing reply , and moved off to the pickled blackfish . I had no idea what the Sarf was . 96 THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS As people were beginning to sit down a young fellow came in and spoke to the host , Yegey , who then tumed to us . “
46420	46424	46341	46346	an open agent of the Sarf	1766	” he said . "
46440	46466	46341	46346	an open agent of the Sarf	1766	" There was a pause , and a buzz , and then the handsome man called Gaum laughed and lifted up his beer - tankard . “
46477	46492	46495	46495	Meshe	437	” he cried . Some drank the toast with him , most did not . “
46505	46592	46495	46495	Meshe	437	" said a fat old man in purple sitting heavily down beside me , his leggings bunched around his thighs like skirts , his face heavy with disgust . Discussion arose as to which of his kemmering - sons Argaven might name as his heir - for he was well over forty and would now surely have no child of his flesh — and how long he might leave Tibe as Regent . Some thought the regency would be ended at once , others were dubious . “
46601	46627	46595	46595	you	1771	” asked the man called Mersen , whom Obsle had identified as a Karhidish agent , and thus presumably one of Tibe 's own men . “
46660	46661	46637	46637	they	1772	" “
46672	46673	46664	46664	I	0	” “
46683	46684	46685	46685	I	0	" "
46690	46928	46685	46685	I	0	" I said , and at this point the host intervened with a mention of the weather ; for people had begun to eat . After servants had cleared away the plates and the mountainous wreckage of roasts and pickles from the buffet , we all sat on around the long table ; small cups of a fierce liquor were served , lifewater they called it , as men often do ; and they asked me questions . Since my examination by the physicians and scientists of Erhenrang I had not been faced with a group of people who wanted me to answer their questions . Few Karhiders , even the fishermen and farmers with whom I had spent my first months , had been willing to satisfy their curiosity — which was often intense - by simply asking . They were involute , introvert , indirect ; they did not like questions and answers . I thought of Otherhord Fastness , of what Faxe the Weaver had said concerning answers . . . . Even the experts had limited their questions to strictly physiological subjects , such as the glandular and circulatory functions in which 97 THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS I differed most notably from the Gethenian norm . They had never gone on to ask , for example , how the continuous sexuality of my race influenced its social institutions , how we handled our “
46932	47304	46685	46685	I	0	” They listened , when I told them ; the psycholo gists listened when I told them about mindspeech ; but not one of them had brought himself to ask enough general questions to form any adequate picture of Terran or Ekumenical society - except , perhaps , Estraven . Here they were n't quite so tied up by considerations of everybody 's prestige and pride , and questions evidently were not insulting either to the asker or the one questioned . However I soon saw that some of the questioners were out to catch me , to prove me a fraud . That threw me off balance a minute . I had of course met with incredulity in Karhide , but seldom with a will to incredulity . Tibe had put on an elaborate show of going - along - withthe - hoax , the day of the parade in Erhenrang , but as I now knew that was part of the game he had played to discredit Estraven , and I guessed that Tibe did in fact believe me . He had seen my ship , after all , the little lander that had brought me down onplanet ; he had free access along with anyone else to the engineers ' reports on the ship and the ansible . None of these Orgota had seen the ship . I could show them the ansible , but it did n't make a very convincing Alien Artifact , being so incomprehensible as to fit in with hoax as well as with reality . The old Law of Cultural Embargo stood against the importation of analyzable , imitable artifacts at this stage , and so I had nothing with me except the ship and ansible , my box of pictures , the indubitable peculiarity of my body , and the unprovable singularity of my mind . The pictures passed around the table , and were examined with the noncommittal expression you see on the faces of people looking at pictures of somebody else 's family . The questioning continued . What , asked Obsle , was the Ekumen — a world , a league of worlds , a place , a government ? "
47594	47595	47598	47598	you	1788	" “
47608	47612	47613	47613	It	38	" said Slose . "
47722	47747	47753	47754	Mr. Ai	384	" How could I explain the Age of the Enemy , and its aftereffects , to a people who had no word for war ? "
47756	47775	47753	47754	Mr. Ai	384	" said the host , Commensal Yegey , a delicate , dapper , drawling fellow with keen eyes . "
47833	47834	47835	47837	None of us	1798	" "
47876	47899	47868	47868	I	0	” That got a laugh all around , for it was the name of Yegey 's party or faction within the Commensality . “
48090	48091	48092	48092	You	1800	” “
48095	48103	48092	48092	You	1800	” Slose repeated , leaning forward intensely : “
48118	48134	48092	48092	You	1800	" I hesitated a moment , for it was not the question I had expected . "
48266	48267	48252	48252	you	1822	" "
48273	48280	48281	48281	You	1825	” said fat Humery beside me . "
48294	48314	48281	48281	You	1825	" He wheezed , like the high notes of an accordion , in disgust and amusement . Gaum spoke : “
48323	48387	48320	48321	Mr. Ai	384	” He put the question softly , half - smiling , as if it were extremely subtle and he wished the subtlety to be noticed . He was a most extraordinarily handsome human being , by any standards and as either sex , and I could n't help staring at him as I answered , and also wondered again what the Sarf was . “
48450	48451	48435	48436	various experts	1830	” "
48454	48474	48435	48436	various experts	1830	” inquired Humery , for I had used the Orgota word for firecracker . 100 THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS "
48499	48516	48493	48493	Gaum	503	" Then you have no means of returning to ... well , wherever you came from ? "
48517	48584	48493	48493	Gaum	503	" Oh , yes . I could speak to Ollul by ansible and ask them to send a NAFAL ship to pick me up . It would get here in seventeen years . Or I could radio to the starship that brought me into your solar system . It 's in orbit around your sun now . It would get here in a matter of days . "
48672	48680	48681	48681	Yegey	461	“ Where is this ship , sir ? "
48684	48695	48681	48681	Yegey	461	" Orbiting the sun , somewhere between Gethen and Kuhurn . "
48696	48706	48714	48715	old Humery	506	" How did you get from it to here ? ”
48707	48712	48714	48715	old Humery	506	" By the firecracker , "
48717	48756	48714	48715	old Humery	506	" Precisely . We do n't land an interstellar ship on a populated planet until open communication or alliance is established . So I came in on a little rocket - boat , and landed on Horden Island . "
48757	48778	48781	48781	Obsle	463	" And you can get in touch with the - with the big ship by ordinary radio , Mr. Ai ? ”
48783	48786	48781	48781	Obsle	463	“ Yes , "
48824	48840	48806	48806	I	0	“ It would take a fairly powerful transmitter , but you have plenty of those . ”
48841	48849	48781	48781	Obsle	463	“ Then we could radio your ship ? "
48850	48943	48944	48944	Someone	1460	" Yes , if you had the proper signal . The people aboard are in a condition we call stasis , hibernation you might say , so that they wo n't lose out of their lives the years they spend waiting for me to get my business done down here . The proper signal on the proper wave - length will set machinery in motion which will bring them out of stasis ; after which they 'll consult with me by radio , or by ansible using Ollul as relay - center . ”
48948	48954	48944	48944	Someone	1460	“ How many of them ? "
48955	48958	48781	48781	Obsle	463	" Eleven . "
48982	48989	48990	48990	Obsle	463	" What if you never signaled ? "
48993	49020	48990	48990	Obsle	463	" They 'll come out of stasis automatically , about four years from now would they come he heard from me . Most likely they a Second "
49030	49031	49022	49022	they	1837	" "
49096	49150	49089	49089	people	831	" Obsle grinned . Most of the others still looked thoughtful and guarded . Gaum gave me an airy little nod , as if applauding my quickness to reply : a conspirator 's nod . Slose was staring brighteyed and tense at some inner vision , from which he turned abruptly to me . “
49153	49157	49158	49159	Mr. Envoy	1841	" he said , “
49177	49178	49162	49162	you	1841	" "
49188	49194	49184	49184	he	1842	” said Gaum , smiling . “

49398	49734	49387	49387	Their	1850	" It went on , right on till dinner was served to us where we sat . We ate and drank and went home , I for one wom out , but pleased all in all with the way things had gone . There were wamings and obscurities , of course . Slose wanted to make a religion of me . Gaum wanted to make a sham of me . Mersen seemed to want to prove that he was not a Karhidish agent by proving that I was . But Obsle , Yegey , and some others were working on a higher level . They wanted to communicate with the Stabiles , and W poch . Their eyes it on till dinner wae . I for one 102 THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS HARASH to bring the NAFAL ship down on Orgota ground , in order to persuade or coerce the Commensality of Orgoreyn to ally itself with the Ekumen . They believed that in doing so Orgoreyn would gain a large and lasting prestige - victory over Karhide , and that ) the Commensals who engineered this victory would gain according prestige and power in their government . Their Open Trade faction , a minority in the Thirty - Three , opposed the continuation of the Sinoth Valley dispute , and in general represented a conservative , unaggressive , nonnationalistic policy . They had been out of power for a long time and were calculating that their way back to power might , with some risks taken , lie on the road I pointed out . That they saw no farther than that , that my mission , was a means to them and not an end , was no great harm . Once they were on the road , they might begin to get some sense of where it could take them . Meanwhile , if shortsighted , they were at least realistic . Obsle , speaking to persuade others , had said , “
49838	49844	49855	49856	Mr. Ai	384	" Then turning to me , “
49880	49881	49872	49873	one man	3759	" "

50146	50425	50116	50116	I	0	” So I backed off as best I could from the subject of the Sarf . What Shusgis had not said on the subject might have meant nothing at all to a man Hain , say , or lucky Chiffewar ; but I was born on Earth . It is not altogether a bad thing to have criminal ancestors . An arsonist grandfather may bequeath one a nose for smelling smoke . It had been entertaining and fascinating to find here on Gethen governments so similar to those in the ancient histories of Terra : a monarchy , and a genuine fullblown bureaucracy . This new development was also fascinating , but less entertaining . It was odd that in the less primitive society , the more sinister note was struck . So Gaum , who wanted me to be a liar , was an agent of the se cret police of Orgoreyn . Did he know that Obsle knew him as such ? No doubt he did . Was he then the agent provocateur ? Was he nominally working with , or against , Obsle 's faction ? Which of the factions within the Government of Thirty - Three controlled , or was controlled by , the Sarf ? I had better get these matters straight , but it might not be easy to do so . My course , which for a while had looked so clear and hopeful , seemed likely to become as tortuous and beset with secrets as it had been in Erhenrang . Everything had gone all right , I thought , until Estraven had appeared shadowlike at my side last night . "
50437	50460	50428	50429	Lord Estraven	385	" I asked Shusgis , who had settled back as if half asleep in the comer of the smooth - running car . "
50503	50504	50505	50505	He	385	" “
50509	50510	50505	50505	He	385	" "
50515	50579	50505	50505	He	385	" 104 THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS I was about to say that it was odd that he had been at Slose 's last night and not at Yegey 's today , when I saw that in the light of our brief moming interview it was n't very odd . Yet even the idea that he was intentionally keeping away made me uncomfortable . “
50584	50597	50580	50580	They	1873	" said Shusgis , resettling his broad hips on the cushioned seat , "
50731	50732	50730	50730	hal	1886	” “
50743	50744	50745	50746	A traitor	1027	" "

50898	50899	50894	50894	I	0	” "
50984	51977	50957	50957	I	0	” Shusgis puffed and nodded vigorously in approval of his own opinion , and smiled at me , the smile of one virtuous man to another . The car ran softly through the wide , well - lit streets . The morning 's snow was melted except for dingy heaps along the gutters ; it was raining now , a cold , small rain . The great buildings of central Mishnory , government offices , schools , Yomesh temples , were so blurred by rain in the liquid 105 THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS glare of the high streetlights that they looked as if they were melting . Their comers were vague , their façades streaked , dewed , smeared . There was something fluid , insubstantial , in the very heaviness of this city built of monoliths , this monolithic state which called the part and the whole by the same name . And Shusgis , my jovial host , a heavy man , a substantial man , he too was somehow , around the comers and edges , a little yague , a little , just a little bit unreal . Ever since I had set off by car through the wide golden fields of Orgoreyn four days ago , beginning my successful progress towards the inner sanctums of Mishnory , I had been missing something . But what ? I felt insulated . I had not felt the cold , lately . They kept rooms decently warm , here . I had not eaten with pleasure , lately . Orgota cooking was insipid ; no harm in that . But why did the people I met , whether well or ill disposed towards me , also seem insipid ? There were vivid personalities among them - Obsle , Slose , the handsome and detestable Gaum - and yet each of them lacked some quality , some dimension of being and they failed to convince . They were not quite solid . It was , I thought , as if they did not cast shadows . This kind of rather highflown speculation is an essential part of my job . Without some capacity for it I could not have qualified as a Mobile , and I received formal training in it on Hain , where they dignify it with the title of Farfetching . What one is after when farfetching might be described as the intuitive perception of a moral entirety , and thus it tends to find expression not in rational symbols , but in metaphor . I was never an outstanding farfetcher , and this night I distrusted my own intuitions , being very tired . When I was back in my apartment I took refuge in a hot shower . But even there I felt a vague unease , as if the hot water was not altogether real and reliable , and could not be counted on . 106 11 . Soliloquies in Mishnory Mishnory . Streth Susmy . I am not hopeful , yet all events show cause for hope . Obsle haggles and dickers with his fellow Commensals , Yegey employs blandishments , Slose proselytizes , and the strength of their following grows . They are astute men , and have their faction well in hand . Only seven of the Thirty - Three are reliable Open Traders ; of the rest , Obsle thinks to gain the sure support of ten , giving a bare majority . One of them seems to have a true interest in the Envoy : Csl . Ithepen of the Eynyen District , who has been curious about the Alien Mission since , while working for the Sarf , he was in charge of censoring the broadcasts we sent out from Erhenrang . He seems to carry the weight of those suppressions on his conscience . He proposed to Obsle that the Thirty - Three announce their invitation to the Star Ship not only to their countrymen , but at the same time to Karhide , asking Argaven to join Karhide 's voice to the invitation . A noble plan , and it will not be followed . They will not ask Karhide to join them in anything . The Sarf 's men among the Thirty - Three of course oppose any consideration at all of the Envoy 's presence and mission . As for those lukewarm and uncommitted whom Obsle hopes to enlist , I think they fear the Envoy , much as Argaven and most of the Court did ; with this difference , that Argaven thought him mad , like himself , while they think him a liar , like themselves . They fear to swallow a great hoax in public , a hoax already refused by Karhide , a hoax perhaps even invented by Karhide . They make their invitation , they make it publicly ; then where is their shifgrethor , when no Star Ship comes ? 107 THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS Indeed Genly Ai demands of us an inordinate trustfulness . To him evidently it is not inordinate . And Obsle and Yegey think that a majority of the Thirty - Three will be persuaded to trust him . I do not know why I am less hopeful than they ; perhaps I do not really want Orgoreyn to prove more enlightened than Karhide , to take the risk and win the praise and leave Karhide in the shadow . If this envy be patriotic , it comes too late ; as soon as I saw that Tibe would soon have me ousted , I did all I could to ensure that the Envoy would come to Orgoreyn , and in exile here I have done what I could to win them to him . Thanks to the money he brought me from Ashe I now live by myself again , as a "
51979	51982	52744	52744	Karhide	397	" not a “
51985	52288	52744	52744	Karhide	397	” I go to no more banquets , am not seen in public with Obsle or other supporters of the Envoy , and have not seen the Envoy himself for over a halfmonth , since his second day in Mishnory . He gave me Ashe 's money as one would give a hired assassin his fee . I have not often been so angry , and I insulted him deliberately . He knew I was angry but I am not sure he understood that he was insulted ; he seemed to accept my advice despite the manner of its giving ; and when my temper cooled I saw this , and was worried by it . Is it possible that all along in Erhenrang he was seeking my advice , not knowing how to tell me that he sought it ? If so , then he must have misunderstood half and not understood the rest of what I told him by my fireside in the Palace , the night after the Ceremony of the Keystone . His shifgrethor must be founded , and composed , and sustained , altogether differently from ours ; and when I thought myself most blunt and frank with him he may have found me most subtle and unclear . His obtuseness is ignorance . His arrogance is ignorance . He is ignorant of us : we of him . He is infinitely a stranger , and I a fool , to let my shadow cross the light of the hope he brings us . I keep my mortal vanity down . I keep out of his way : for clearly that is what he wants . He is right . An exiled Karhidish traitor is no credit to his cause . Conformable to the Orgota law that each "
52290	52737	52738	52738	We	1893	" must have employment , I work from Eighth Hour to noon in a plastics factory . Easy work : I run a machine which fits together and heatbonds pieces of plastic to form little transparent boxes . I do not know what the boxes are for . In the aftemoon , finding myself ELE SON A PEX 108 THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS dull , I have taken up the old disciplines I learned in Rotherer . I am glad to see I have lost no skill at summoning dothe - strength , or entering the untrance ; but I get little good out of the untrance , and as for the skills of stillness and of fasting , I might as well never have learned them , and must start all over , like a child . I have fasted now one day , and my belly screams A week ! A m monthl The nights freeze now ; tonight a hard wind bears frozen rain . All evening I have thought continually of Estre and the sound of the wind seems the sound of the wind that blows there . I wrote to my son tonight , a long letter . While writing it I had again and again a sense of Arek 's presence , as if I should see him if I turned . Why do I keep such notes as these ? For my son to read ? Little good they would do him . I write to be writing in my own language , perhaps . Harhahad Susmy . Still no mention of the Envoy has been made on the radio , not a word . I wonder if Genly Ai sees that in Orgoreyn , despite the vast visible apparatus of government , nothing is done visibly , nothing is said aloud . The machine conceals the machinations . Tibe wants to teach Karhide how to lie . He takes his lessons from Orgoreyn : a good school . But I think we shall have trouble learning how to lie , having for so long practiced the art of goingi round and round the truth without ever lying about it , or reach ing it either . A big Orgota foray yesterday across the Ey ; they burned the granaries of Tekember . Precisely what the Sarf wants , and what Tibe wants . But where does it end ? Slose , having tumed his Yomesh mysticism onto the Envoy 's statements , interprets the coming of the Ekumen to earth as the coming of the Reign of Meshe among men , and loses sight of our purpose . “

Slose heads a committee that purposes to suppress the obscene plays performed in public kemmerhouses here ; they must be like the Karhidish huhuth . Slose opposes them because they are trivial , vulgar , and blasphemous . 109 THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS 11 TOP say here “

Fear undoes * * * his mission and my hope , once more . Not fear of the alien , the unearthly , not here . These Orgota have not the wits nor size of spirit to fear what is truly and immensely strange . They can not even see it . They look at the man from another world and see what ? a spy from Karhide , a pervert , an agent , a sorry little political Unit like themselves . If he does not send for the ship at once it will be too late ; it may be already too late . It is my fault . I have done nothing right . 115 12 . On Time and Darkness From The Sayings of Tuhulme the High Priest , a book of the Yomesh Canon , composed in North Orgoreyn about 900 years ago . MESHE IS the Center of Time . That moment of his life when he saw all things clearly came when he had lived on earth thirty years , and after it he lived on earth again thirty years , so that the Seeing befell in the center of his life . And all the ages up until the Seeing were as long as the ages will be after the Seeing , which befell in the Center of Time . And in the Center there is no time past and no time to come . In all time past it is . In all time to come it is . It has not been nor yet will it be . It is . It is all . Nothing is unseen . The poor man of Sheney came to Meshe lamenting that he had not food to give the child of his flesh , nor grain to sow , for the rains had rotted the seed in the ground and all the folk of his hearth starved . Meshe said , “
56246	56293	56296	56297	a man	818	" The poor man of Sheney dug in the moraines of Tuerresh and unearthed where Meshe pointed a great hoard of ancient jewels , and at sight of it he shouted aloud for joy . But Meshe standing by wept at sight of it , saying , “
56361	56465	56354	56354	I	0	” The life of every man is in the Center of Time , for all were seen in the Seeing of Meshe , and are in his Eye . We are the pupils of his Eye . Our doing is his Seeing : our being his Knowing . A hemmen - tree in the heart of Omen Forest , which lies a hundred miles long and a hundred miles wide , was old and greatly grown , with a hundred branches and on every branch a thousand twigs and on every twig a hundred leaves . The tree said in its rooted being , “
56515	57469	57474	57475	The guards	2018	" Meshe passed through the Forest of Omen in his wanderings , and from that one tree plucked that one leaf . No raindrop falls in the storms of autumn that ever fell before , and the rain has fallen , and falls , and will fall throughout all the autumns of the years . Meshe saw each drop , where it fell , and falls , and will fall . In the Eye of Meshe are all the stars , and the darknesses between the stars : and all are bright . In the answering of the Question of the Lord of Shorth , in the moment of the Seeing , Meshe saw all the sky as if it were all one sun . Above the earth and under the earth all the sphere of sky was bright as the sun 's surface , and there was no darkness . For he saw not what was , nor what will be , but what is . The stars that flee and take away their light all were present in his eye , and all their light shone presently . * Darkness is only in the mortal eye , that thinks it sees , but sees not . In the Sight of Meshe there is no darkness . * This is a mystical expression of one of the theories used to support the expanding - universe hypothesis , first proposed by the Mathematical School of Sith over four thousand years ago and generally accepted by later cosmologists , even though meteorological conditions on Gethen prevent their gathering much observational support from astronomy . The rate of expansion ( Hubble 's constant ; Rerherek 's constant ) can in fact be estimated from the observed amount of light in the night sky ; the point here involved is that , if the universe were not expanding , the night sky would not appear to be dark . 117 THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS Therefore those that call upon the darkness * * are made fools of and spat out from the mouth of Meshe , for they name what is not , calling it Source and End . There is neither source nor end , for all things are in the Center of Time . As all the stars may be reflected in a round raindrop falling in the night : so too do all the stars reflect the raindrop . There is neither darkness nor death , for all things are , in the light of the Moment , and their end and their beginning are one . One center , one seeing , one law , one light . Look now into the Eye of Meshel * * The Handdarata . 118 13 . Down on the Farm ALARMED BY Estraven 's sudden reappearance , his familiarity with my affairs , and the fierce urgency of his warnings , I hailed a taxi and drove straight to Obsle ’s island , meaning to ask the Commensal how Estraven knew so much and why he had suddenly popped up from nowhere urging me to do precisely what Obsle yesterday had advised against doing . The Commensal was out , the doorkeeper did not know where he was or when he would be in . I went to Yegey 's house with no better luck . A heavy snow , the heaviest of the autumn so far , was falling ; my driver refused to take me farther than to Shusgis ' house , as he did not have Snow - cleats on his tires . That evening I failed to reach Obsle , Yegey , or Slose by telephone . At dinner Shusgis explained : a Yomesh festival was going on , the Solemnity of the Saints and Throne - Upholders , and high officials of the Commensality were expected to be seen at the temples . He also explained Estraven 's behavior , shrewdly enough , as that of a man once powerful and now fallen , who grasps at any chance to influence persons or events — always less rationally , more desperately , as time passes and he knows himself sinking into powerless anonymity . I agreed that this would explain Estraven 's anxious , almost frantic manner . The anxiety had however infected me . I was vaguely ill at ease all through that long and heavy meal . Shusgis talked and talked to me and to the many employees , aides and sycophants who sat down at his table nightly ; I had never known him so longwinded , so relentlessly jovial . When dinner was over it was pretty late for going out again , and in any case the Solemnity would keep all the Commensals busy , Shusgis 119 THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS MES said , until after midnight . I decided to pass up supper , and went to bed early . Some time between midnight and dawn I was awakened by strangers , informed that I was under arrest , and taken by an armed guard to the Kundershaden Prison . Kundershaden is old , one of the few very old buildings left in Mishnory . I had noticed it often as I went about the city , a long grimy many - towered ill - looking place , distinct among the pallid bulks and hulks of the Commensal edifices . It is what it looks like and is called . It is a jail . It is not a front for something else , not a façade , not a pseudonym . It is real , the real thing , the thing be- "

Or they may have been carrying out an experiment on you and the others . I have been told they test mindchanging drugs and techniques on prisoners in the Farms .

They might show you around the First District Voluntary Farm just outside Mishnory , a fine showplace from all accounts . If you be 140 THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS lieve that we have Farms in Karhide , Mr. Ai , you overestimate us seriously . We are not a sophisticated people . "

68090	68203	68204	68204	He	2486	" Mr. Ai , any one of you prisoners , or all of you together , could have walked out of that place , any night . If you were n't starved , exhausted , demoralized , and drugged ; and if you had winter clothing , and if you had somewhere to go .... There 's the catch . Where would you go ? To a town ? No papers ; you 're done for . Into the wilderness ? No shelter ; you 're done for . In summer , I expect they bring more guards into Pulefen Farm . In winter , they use winter itself to guard it . ”
68209	68236	68204	68204	He	2486	“ You could n't carry me a hundred feet , Estraven . Let alone run , carrying me , a couple of miles crosscountry in the dark "

68298	68319	68204	68204	He	2486	" I thought that after the dothe period , the extreme drain on one 's energy necessitated a sort of collapse- "
68320	68405	68204	68204	He	2486	" Yes ; thangen , it 's called , the dark sleep . It lasts much longer than the dothe period , and once you enter the recovery period it 's very dangerous to try to resist it . I slept straight through two nights . I 'm still in thangen now ; I could n't walk over the hill . And hunger 's part of it , I 've eaten up most of the rations I 'd planned to last me the week . ”
68406	68410	68411	68411	he	2486	" All right , "

68589	69000	68537	68537	I	0	“ Mr. Ai , we 've seen the same events with different eyes ; I wrongly thought they 'd seem the same to us . Let me go back to last spring . I began to encourage King Argaven to wait , to make no decision concerning you or your mission , about a halfmonth before the day of the Ceremony of the Keystone . The audience was already planned , and it seemed best to go through with it , though without looking for any results from it . All this I thought you understood , and in that I erred . I took too much for granted ; I did n't wish to offend you , to advise you ; I thought you understood the danger of Pemmer Harge rem ir Tibe 's sudden ascendancy in the kyorremy . If Tibe had known any good reason to fear you , he would have accused you of serving a faction , and Argaven , who is very easily moved by fear , would likely have had you murdered . I wanted you down , and safe , while Tibe was up and powerful . As it chanced , I went down with you . I was bound to fall , though I did n't know it would be that very night we talked together ; but no one is Argaven 's prime minister for long . After I received the Order of Exile I could not communicate with you lest I contaminate you with my disgrace , and so increase your peril . I came here to Orgoreyn . I tried to suggest to you that you should also come to Orgoreyn . I urged the men I distrusted least among the Thirty - Three Commensals to grant you entry ; you would not have got it without their favor . They saw , and I encouraged them to see , in you a way towards power , a way out of the increasing rivalry with Karhide and back towards the restoration of open trade , a chance perhaps to break the grip of the Sarf . But they are over - cautious men , afraid to act . Instead of proclaiming you , they hid you , and so lost their chance , and sold you to the Sarf to save their own pelts . I counted too much on them , and therefore the fault is mine . "
69002	69034	68537	68537	I	0	“ But for what purpose - all this intriguing , this hiding and power - seeking and plotting - what was it all for , Estraven ? What were you after ? "
69041	69064	69065	69065	We	2489	" I was after what you 're after : the alliance of my world with your worlds . What did you think ? "
69082	69096	69065	69065	We	2489	" You mean , even if it was Orgoreyn that made the alliance ? "
69097	69148	68537	68537	I	0	" Even if it was Orgoreyn . Karhide would soon have followed . Do you think I would play shifgrethor when so much is at stake for all of us , all my fellow men ? What does it matter which country wakens first , so long as we waken ? ”
69149	69159	69160	69160	he	2491	" How the devil can I believe anything you sayl "
69174	69208	69167	69167	his	2491	“ If all this is true , you might have explained some of it earlier , last spring , and spared us both a trip to Pulefen . Your efforts on my behalf — "
69209	69332	68537	68537	I	0	" Have failed . And have put you in pain , and shame , and danger . I know it . But if I had tried to fight Tibe for your sake , you would not be here now , you 'd be in a grave in Erhenrang . And there are now a few people in Karhide , and a few in Orgoreyn , who believe your story , because they listened to me . They may yet serve you . My greatest error was .. as you say , in not making myself clear to you . I am not used to doing so . I am not used to giving , or ao cepting , either advice or blame . "
69333	69344	69167	69167	his	2491	" I do n't mean to be unjust , Estraven — "
69345	69383	69384	69384	He	2492	" Yet you are . It is strange . I am the only man in all Gethen that has trusted you entirely , and I am the only man in Gethen that you have refused to trust . ”
69397	69404	69392	69392	He	2492	" I 'm sorry , Estraven . ”
69412	69417	69418	69418	I	0	" The fact is , "
69421	69442	69418	69418	I	0	" that you 're unable , or unwilling , to be lieve in the fact that I believe in you . ”
69463	69469	69470	69470	I	0	“ Teach me your mindspeech , "
69482	69508	69470	69470	I	0	" your language that has no lies in it . Teach me that , and then ask me why I did what I 've done . ”
69509	69519	69527	69527	I	0	" I should like to do that , Estraven . "
69832	69842	69784	69784	he	385	“ Where do we go from here , Estraven ? "
69843	69867	69784	69784	he	385	" It depends on where you want to go , Mr. Ai . And on what . kind of travel you can manage . "
69868	69878	69784	69784	he	385	“ What 's the quickest way out of Orgoreyn ? "
69879	69891	69784	69784	he	385	" West . To the coast . Thirty miles or so . ”
69892	69896	69784	69784	he	385	“ What then ? "
69903	69982	69784	69784	he	385	“ The harbors will be freezing or already frozen , here . In any case no ships go out far in winter . It would be a matter of waiting in hiding somewhere until next spring , when the great traders go out to Sith and Perunter . None will be going to Karhide , if the trade - embargoes continue . We might work our passage on a trader . I am out of money , unfortunately . ”
69983	69989	69784	69784	he	385	" Is there any alternative ? ”
69990	69995	69784	69784	he	385	“ Karhide . Overland . ”
69996	70006	69784	69784	he	385	" How far is it - a thousand miles ? "
70007	70055	69784	69784	he	385	" Yes , by road . But we could n't go on the roads . We would n't get past the first Inspector . Our only way would be north through the mountains , east across the Gobrin , and down to the border at Guthen Bay . "
70056	70069	70070	70070	He	2495	" Across the Gobrin - the ice - sheet , you mean ? "
70073	70084	70070	70070	He	2495	“ It 's not possible in winter , is it ? ”
70085	70164	69784	69784	he	385	" I think so ; with luck , as in all winter journeys . In one respect a Glacier crossing is better in winter . The good weather , you know , tends to stay over the great glaciers , where the ice reflects the heat of the sun ; the storms are pushed out to the periphery . Therefore the legends about the Place inside the Blizzard . That might be in our favor . Little else . "
70165	70171	69784	69784	he	385	“ Then you seriously think — "
70172	70189	70070	70070	He	2495	“ There would have been no point taking you from Pulefen Farm if I did not . ”
70208	70234	70235	70235	He	2495	" And I take it that you consider the Ice - crossing a better risk than waiting about till spring for a sea - crossing ? "
70238	70241	70242	70242	he	2495	“ Solitude , ”
70255	70302	70247	70247	I	0	“ I hope you 've taken my inade quacies into account . I 'm not as coldproof as you , nowhere near it . I 'm no expert on skis . I 'm not in good shape - though much improved from a few days ago . "
70307	70315	70316	70316	he	2495	“ I think we might make it , ”
70331	70335	70316	70316	he	2495	" All right . "
70428	70434	70435	70435	he	2495	" It will be hard , "
70443	70456	70435	70435	he	2495	“ Very hard . Without luck , we will not make it . "
70457	70476	70477	70477	He	2495	“ I 'd rather die up on the Ice than in that cesspool you got me out of . "
70496	70503	70504	70504	he	2495	“ We 'll need more food , "
70507	70529	70504	70504	he	2495	" What happens if we do make it to Karhide - to you , I mean ? You 're still proscribed . "
70541	70553	70530	70530	He	2495	“ Yes . I suppose I 'd stay on this side . "
70554	70567	70504	70504	he	2495	“ And when they found you 'd helped their prisoner escape - pa “
70574	70583	70568	70568	They	2498	” He smiled , bleak , and said , “
70592	70597	70568	70568	They	2498	” I broke out , “
70610	70611	70606	70606	I	0	" “
70614	70652	70606	70606	I	0	” He stood up , still chewing , put on his hieb , coat , and boots , and slipped otterlike out the self - sealing valved door . From outside he stuck his head back in : "
70667	70668	70663	70663	you	0	” “
70671	70673	70663	70663	you	0	" . "
70677	70829	70663	70663	you	0	” With that he was off . I never knew a person who reacted so wholly and rapidly to a changed situation as Estraven . I was recovering , and willing to go ; he was out of thangen ; the instant that was all clear , he was off . He was never rash or hurried , but he was always ready . It was the secret , no doubt , of the extraordinary political career he threw away for my sake ; it was also the explanation of his belief in me and devotion to my mission . When I came , he was ready . Nobody else on Winter was . Yet he considered himself a slow man , poor in emergencies . Once he told me that , being so slow - thinking , he had to guide his acts by a general intuition of which way his “
70831	71385	71388	71388	you	2501	” was running , and that this intuition rarely failed him . He said it seriously ; it may have been true . The Foretellers of the Fastnesses are not the only people on Winter who can see ahead . They have tamed and trained the hunch , but not increased its certainty . In this matter the Yomeshta also have a point : the gift is perhaps not 146 THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS le strictly or simply one of foretelling , but is rather the power of seeing ( if only for a flash ) everything at once : seeing whole I kept the little heater - stove at its hottest setting while Estraven was gone , and so got warm clear through for the first time in - how long ? I thought it must be Thern by now , the first month of winter and of a new Year One , but I had lost count in Pulefen . The stove was one of those excellent and economical devices perfected by the Gethenians in their millennial effort to outwit cold . Only the use of a fusion - pack as power source could improve it . Its bionic - powered battery was good for fourteen months ' continuous use , its heat output was intense , it was stove , heater , and lantem all in one , and it weighed about four pounds . We would never have got fifty miles without it . It must have cost a good deal of Estraven 's money , that money I had loftily handed over to him in Mishnory . The tent , which was made of plastics developed for weather - resistance and designed to cope with at least some of the inside water - condensation that is the plague of tents in cold weather , the pesthry - fur sleeping - bags ; the clothes , skis , sledge , food - supplies , everything was of the finest make and kind , lightweight , durable , expensive . If he had gone to get more food , what was he going to get it with ? He did not return till nightfall next day . I had gone out several times on snowshoes , gathering strength and getting practice by waddling around the slopes of the snowy vale that hid our tent . I was competent on skis , but not much good on snowshoes . I dared not go far over the hilltops , lest I lose my backtrack ; it was wild country , steep , full of creeks and ravines , rising fast to the cloudhaunted mountains eastward . I had time to wonder what I would do in this forsaken place if Estraven did not come back . He came swooping over the dusky hill — he was a magnificent skier - and stopped beside me , dirty and tired and heavy - laden . He had on his back a huge sooty sack stuffed full of bundles : Father Christmas , who pops down the chimneys of old Earth . The bundles contained kadik - germ , dried breadapple , tea , and slabs of the hard , red , earthy - tasting sugar that Gethenians refine from one of their tubers . “
71393	71394	71388	71388	you	2501	" "
71398	71438	71388	71388	you	2501	" said the one - time Prime Minister of Karhide , holding his hands over the stove , which he had not yet tumed down ; 147 THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS he , even he , was cold . "
71445	71489	71490	71490	We	2502	" That was all I ever leamed . He was not proud of his exploit , and not able to laugh at it . Stealing is a vile crime on Winter ; indeed the only man more despised than the thief is the suicide.com “
71498	71515	71490	71490	We	2502	” he said , as I set a pan of snow on the stove to melt . "
71520	71531	71490	71490	We	2502	" Most of the food he had laid in previously was “
71533	72123	71490	71490	We	2502	” rations , a fortified , dehydrated , compressed , cubed mixture of high - energy foods — the Orgota name for it is gichy - michy , and that 's what we called it , though of course we spoke Karhidish together . We had enough of it to last us sixty days at the minimal standard ration : a pound a day apiece . After he had washed up and eaten , Estraven sat a long time by the stove that night figuring out precisely what we had and how and when we must use it . We had no scales , and he had to estimate , using a pound box of gichy - michy as standard . He knew , as do many Gethenians , the caloric and nutritive value of each food ; he knew his own requirements under various conditions , and how to estimate mine pretty closely . Such knowledge has high survival - value , on Winter . When at last he had got our rations planned out , he rolled over onto his bag and went to sleep . During the night I heard him talking numbers out of his dreams : weights , days , distances . ... We had , very roughly , eight hundred miles to go . The first hundred would be north or northeast , going through the forest and across the northernmost spurs of the Sembensyen range to the great glacier , the ice - sheet that covers the double - lobed Great Continent everywhere north of the 45th parallel , and in places dips down almost to the 35th . One of these southward extensions is in the region of the Fire - Hills , the last peaks of the Sembensyens , and that region was our first goal . There among the mountains , Estraven reasoned , we should be able to get onto the surface of the ice - sheet , either descending onto it from a mountain - slope or climbing up to it on the slope of one of its effluent glaciers . Thereafter we would travel on the Ice itself , eastward , for some six hundred miles . Where its edge trends north again near the Bay of Guthen we would come down off it and cut southeast a last fifty or a hundred miles across the Shenshey Bogs , which by then should be ten or twenty feet deep in snow , to the Karhidish border . 148 THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS This route kept us clear from start to finish of inhabited , or inhabitable , country . We would not be meeting any Inspectors . This was indubitably of the first importance . I had no papers , and Estraven said that his would n't hold up under any further forgeries . In any case , though I could pass for a Gethenian when no one expected anything else , I was not disguisable to an eye looking for me . In this respect , then , the way Estraven proposed for us was highly practical . In all other respects it seemed perfectly insane . I kept my opinion to myself , for I fully meant what I 'd said about preferring to die escaping , if it came down to a choice of deaths . Estraven , however , was still exploring alternatives . Next day , which we spent in loading and packing the sledge very carefully , he said , "
72136	72137	71490	71490	We	2502	" "
72170	72171	71490	71490	We	2502	” “
72175	72176	71490	71490	We	2502	" "
72213	72226	72227	72227	I	0	" He tugged a cord tight and knotted it before he answered . “
72254	72255	72227	72227	I	0	” "
72259	72260	72227	72227	I	0	" “

72336	72368	72370	72370	I	0	" He nodded . I lugged the last sack of kadik - germ out of the tent , fitted it into its niche in the sledge - load , and said , “
72407	72408	72404	72404	I	0	” "
72414	72421	72404	72404	I	0	" 149 THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS "

72466	72480	72454	72454	I	0	" he said , and smiled . He was not one for regrets . "
72494	72706	72492	72492	you	2503	" When the sledge was loaded , he insisted that we spend the rest of the day doing nothing , storing energy . He lay in the tent writing , in a little notebook , in his small , rapid , vertical - cursive Karhidish hand , the account that appears as the previous chapter . He had n't been able to keep up his joumal during the past month , and that annoyed him ; he was pretty methodical about that joumal . Its writing was , I think , both an obligation to and a link with his family , the Hearth of Estre . I learned that later , however , at the time I did n't know what he was writing , and I sat waxing skis , or doing nothing . I whistled a dance - tune , and stopped myself in the middle . We only had one tent , and if we were going to share it without driving each other mad , a certain amount of self - restraint , of manners , was evidently required ... i Estraven had looked up at my whistling , all right , but not with irritation . He looked at me rather dreamily , and said , “

72858	72951	72953	72953	we	2525	" When he spoke , I found myself believing that we would in fact reach Karhide , across eight hundred miles of mountain , ravine , crevasse , volcano , glacier , ice - sheet , frozen bog or frozen bay , all desolate , shelterless , and lifeless , in the storms of midwinter in the middle of an Ice Age . He sat writing up his records with the same obdurate patient thoroughness I had seen in a mad king up on a scaffolding mortaring a joint , and said , "
72958	73104	72953	72953	we	2525	" 150 THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS His when was no mere dateless hope , either . He intended to reach Karhide by the fourth day of the fourth month of winter , Arhad Anner . We were to start tomorrow , the thirteenth of the first month , Tormenbod Them . Our rations , as well as he could calculate , might be stretched at farthest to three Gethenian months , 78 days ; so we would go twelve miles a day for seventy days , and get to Karhide on Arhad Anner . That was all settled . No more to do now but get a good sleep . We set off at dawn , on snowshoes , in a thin , windless snowfall . The surface over the hills was bessa , soft and still unpacked , what Terran skiers I think call “
73106	73388	73389	73389	You	2526	” snow . The sledge was heavy loaded ; Estraven guessed the total weight to pull at something over 300 pounds . It was hard to pull in the fluffy snow , though it was as handy as a well - designed little boat ; the runners were marvels , coated with a polymer that cut resistance almost to nothing , but of course that was no good when the whole thing was stuck in a drift . On such a surface , and going up and down slopes and gullies , we found it best to go one in harness pulling and one behind pushing . The snow fell , fine and mild , all day long . We stopped twice for a bite of food . In all the vast hilly country there was no sound . We went on , and all of a sudden it was twilight . We halted in a valley very like the one we had left that morning , a dell among white - humped hills . I was so tired I staggered , yet I could not believe the day was over . We had covered , by the sledgemeter , almost fifteen miles . If we could go that well in soft snow , fully loaded , through a steep country whose hills and valleys all ran athwart our way , then surely we could do better up on the Ice , with hard snow , a level way , and a load always lighter . My trust in Estraven had been more willed than spontaneous ; now I believed him completely . We would be in Karhide in seventy days . "
73396	73401	73389	73389	You	2526	" I asked him . "

It was blind dark outside ; snow fell fine and thin , just visible in the oval dim shaft of light from the valve . Sealed again in the dry warmth of the tent , we laid out our bags . He said something , “
74166	74176	74163	74164	Mr. Ai	384	" or some such remark , and I said , "

74317	74328	74315	74315	Ai	376	” said the alien , and the other alien said , “
74334	75030	74332	74332	Harth	524	” A friend . What is a friend , in a world where any friend may be a lover at a new phase of the moon ? Not I , locked in my virility : no friend to Therem Harth , or any other of his race . Neither man nor woman , neither and both , cyclic , lunar , metamorphosing under the hand 's touch , changelings in the human cradle , they were no flesh of mine , no friends ; no love between us . We slept . I woke once and heard the snow ticking thick and soft on the tent . Estraven was up at dawn getting breakfast . The day broke bright . We loaded up and were off as the sun gilded the tops of the scrubby bushes rimming the dell , Estraven pulling in hamess and I as pusher and rudder at the stem . The snow was beginning to get a crust on it ; on clear downslopes we went like a dog - team , at a run . That day we skirted and then entered the forest that borders Pulefen Farm , the forest of dwarfs , thick - set , gnurllimbed , ice - bearded thore - trees . We dared not use the main road north , but logging - roads lent their direction to us sometimes for a 153 THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS while , and as the forest was kept clear of fallen trees and undergrowth we got on well . Once we were in Tarrenpeth there were fewer ravines or steep ridges . The sledge - meter at evening said twenty miles for the day 's run , and we were less tired than the night before . One palliative of winter on Winter is that the days stay light . The planet has a few degrees of tilt to the plane of the ecliptic , not enough to make an appreciable seasonal difference in low latitudes . Season is not a hemispheric effect but a global one , a result of the elliptoid orbit . At the far and slow - moving end of the orbit , approaching and departing from aphelion , there is just enough loss of solar radiation to disturb the already uneasy weather patterns , to chill down what is cold already , and turn the wet gray summer into white violent winter . Dryer than the rest of the year , winter might be pleasanter , if it were not for the cold . The sun , when you see it , shines high ; there is no slow bleeding away of light into the darkness , as on the polar slopes of Earth where cold and night come on together . Gethen has a bright winter , bitter , terrible , and brigh . We were three days getting through Tarrenpeth Forest . On the last , Estraven stopped and made camp early , in order to set traps . He wanted to catch some pesthry . They are one of the larger landanimals of Winter , about the size of a fox , oviparous vegetarians with a splendid coat of gray or white fur . He was after the meat , for pesthry are edible . They were migrating south in vast numbers ; they are so light - footed and solitary that we saw only two or three as we hauled , but the snow was thick - starred in every glade of the thore - forest with countless little snowshoe tracks , all heading south . Estraven 's snares were full in an hour or two . He cleaned and cut up the six beasts , hung some of the meat to freeze , stewed some for our meal that night . Gethenians are not a hunting people , because there is very little to hunt - no large herbivores , thus no large carnivores , except in the teeming seas . They fish , and farm . I had never before seen a Gethenian with blood on his hands . Estraven looked at the white pelts . “
75045	75049	75040	75043	a pesthry - hunter	2556	" he said . “
75054	75117	74332	74332	Harth	524	” He held out one for me to touch . The fur was so soft and deep that you could not be certain when your hand began to feel it . Our sleeping bags , coats , and hoods were lined with that same fur , an TREND . 154 THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS unsurpassed insulator and very beautiful to see . "
75123	75127	74332	74332	Harth	524	” I said , “
75132	75143	74332	74332	Harth	524	" Estraven gave me his brief dark stare and said , “
75148	75460	74332	74332	Harth	524	” And tossed away the pelts , where overnight the russy , the fierce little rat - snakes , would devour them and the entrails and the bones , and lick clean the bloody snow . He was right ; he was generally right . There was a pound or two of edible meat on a pesthry . I ate my half of the stew that night and could have eaten his without noticing . Next morning , when we started up into the mountains , I was twice the sledge - engine I had been . We went up that day . The beneficent snowfall and kroxetwindless weather between 0 ° F. and 20 ° —that had seen us through Tarrenpeth and out of range of probable pursuit , now dissolved wretchedly into abovefreezing temperatures and rain . Now I began to understand why Gethenians complain when the temperature rises in winter , and cheer up when it falls . In the city , rain is an inconvenience ; to a traveler it is a catastrophe . We hauled that sledge up the Aanks of the Sembensyens all moming through a deep , cold porridge of rain - sodden snow . By afternoon on steep slopes the snow was mostly gone . Torrents of rain , miles of mud and gravel . We cased the runners , put the wheels on the sledge , and hauled on up . As a wheeled cart it was a bitch , sticking and tipping every moment . Dark fell before we found any shelter of cliff or cave to set up the tent in , so that despite all our care things got wet . Estraven had said that a tent such as ours would house us pretty comfortably in any weather at all , so long as we kept it dry inside . “
75521	75649	75501	75501	We	2559	” I had listened , and had been as scrupulous as he about keeping snow and wet out of the tent , so that there was only the unavoidable moisture from our cooking , and our lungs and pores , to be evaporated . But this night everything was wet through before we could get the tent up . We huddled steaming over the Chabe stove , and presently had a stew of pesthry meat to eat , hot and solid , good enough almost to compensate for everything else . The sledge - meter , ignoring the hard uphill work we had done all day , said we had come only nine miles . o set up park fellat it was 155 THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS "
75660	75799	75501	75501	We	2559	" I said . Estraven nodded , and neatly cracked a legbone for the marrow . He had stripped off his wet outer clothes and sat in shirt and breeches , barefoot , collar open . I was still too cold to take off my coat and hieb and boots . There he sat cracking marrowbones , neat , tough , durable , his sleek furlike hair shedding the water like a bird 's feathers : he dripped a little onto his shoulders , like house - eaves dripping , and never noticed it . He was not discouraged . He belonged here . The first meat - ration had given me some intestinal cramps , and that night they got severe . I lay awake in the soggy darkness loud with rain . At breakfast he said , "
75806	75807	75800	75800	You	2560	” "
75813	75837	75810	75810	you	2560	” For he slept very deeply , scarcely moving , even when I left the tent . He gave me that look again . “

75846	75853	75810	75810	you	2560	" He winced and said savagely , “

75889	76145	75810	75810	you	2560	" Rain fell and fell . A west wind off the sea kept the temperature in the thirties , even here at three or four thousand feet of altitude . We never saw more than a quarter - mile ahead through the gray mist and mass of rain . What slopes rose on above us I never looked up to see : nothing to see but rain falling . We went by compass , keeping as much to northward as the cut and veer of the great slopes allowed . The glacier had been over these mountainsides , in the hundreds of thousands of years it had been grinding back and forth across the North . There were tracks scored along granite slopes , long and straight as if cut with a great U - gouge . We could pull the sledge along those scratches sometimes as if along a road . I did best pulling ; I could lean into the hamess , and the work kept me warm . When we stopped for a bite of food at midday , I felt sick and cold , and could not eat . We went on , climbing again now . Rain fell , and fell , and fell . Estraven stopped us under a great overhang of black rock , along in mid - afternoon . He had the 156 THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS tent up almost before I was out of hamess . He ordered me to go in and lie down . "

He was frank , and expected a reciprocal frankness that I might not be able to supply . He , after all , had no standards of manliness , of virility , to complicate his pride . On the other hand , if he could lower all his standards of shif . grethor , as I realized he had done with me , perhaps I could dispense with the more competitive elements of my masculine self - respect , which he certainly understood as little as I understood shifgrethor . ...

76537	76548	76408	76408	We	2561	" He looked around and smiled a little , gently . “
76552	76920	76921	76921	I	0	" he said . The next day we did seven miles , the next day twelve , and the day after that we came out of the rain , and out of the clouds , and out of the regions of mankind . It was the ninth day of our journey . We were five to six thousand feet above sealevel now , on a high plateau full of the evidences of recent mountain - building 157 THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS and vulcanism ; we were in the Fire - Hills of the Sembensyen Range . The plateau narrowed gradually to a valley and the valley to a pass between long ridges . As we approached the end of the pass the rainclouds were thinning and rending . A cold north wind dispersed them utterly , laying bare the peaks above the ridges to our right and left , basalt and snow , piebald and patchwork of black and white brilliant under the sudden sun in a dazzling sky . Ahead of us , cleared and revealed by the same vast sweep of the wind , lay twisted valleys , hundreds of feet below , full of ice and boulders . Across those valleys a great wall stood , a wall of ice , and raising our eyes up and still up to the rim of the wall we saw the Ice itself , the Gobrin Glacier , blinding and horizonless to the utmost north , a white , a white the eyes could not look on . Here and there out of the valleys full of rubble and out of the cliffs and bends and masses of the great ice - field 's edge , black ridges rose ; one great mass loomed up out of the plateau to the height of the gateway peaks we stood between , and from its side drifted heavily a mile - long wisp of smoke . Farther off there were others : peaks , pinnacles , black cindercones on the glacier . Smoke panted from fiery mouths that opened out of the ice . Estraven stood there in harness beside me looking at that magnificent and unspeakable desolation . “
76931	77073	76924	76924	I	0	” he said . I felt as he did . It is good to have an end to journey towards ; but it is the journey that matters , in the end . It had not rained , here on these north - facing slopes . Snowfields stretched down from the pass into the valleys of moraine . We stowed the wheels , uncapped the sledge - runners , put on our skis , and took off - down , north , onward , into that silent vastness of fire and ice that said in enormous letters of black and white DEATH , DEATH , written right across a continent . The sledge pulled like a feather , and we laughed with joy . 158 16 . Between Drumner and Dremegole Odyrny Thern . Ai asks from his sleeping - bag , “

All the rest latent , if that . You know I told you that except in the case of the born Sensitive , the capacity , though it has a physiological basis , is a psychological one , a product of culture , a side effect of the use of the mind . Young children , and defectives , and members of unevolved or regressed societies , ca n't mindspeak . The mind must exist on a certain plane of complexity first . You ca n't build up amino acids out of hydro- 179 mplexo THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS gen atoms ; a good deal of complexifying has to take place first : ( the same situation . Abstract thought , varied social interaction , intricate cultural adjustments , esthetic and ethical perception , all of it has to reach a certain level before the connections can be made - before the potentiality can be touched at all . "
87499	87509	87271	87271	he	2799	" Perhaps we Gethenians have n't attained that level . ”
87510	87698	87271	87271	he	2799	" You 're far beyond it . But luck is involved . As in the creation of amino acids . . . . Or to take analogies on the cultural plane only analogies , but they illuminate — the scientific method , for instance , the use of concrete , experimental techniques in science . There are peoples of the Ekumen who possess a high culture , a complex society , philosophies , arts , ethics , a high style and a great achievement in all those fields ; and yet they have never learned to weigh a stone accurately . They can leam how , of course . Only for half a million years they never did . . . . There are peoples who have no higher mathematics at all , nothing beyond the simplest applied arithmetic . Every one of them is capable of understanding the calculus , but not one of them does or ever has . As a matter of fact , my own people , the Terrans , were ignorant until about three thousand years ago of the uses of zero . "

We went on for four more days of very bitter cold , never above -25 ° , and then came another blizzard whooping up in our faces from the east on a gale wind . Within two minutes of the first strong gusts the snow blew so thick that I could not see Estraven six feet away . I had turned my back on him and the sledge and the plastering , blinding , suffocating snow in order to get my breath , and when a minute later I turned around he was gone . The sledge was gone . Nothing was there . I took a few steps to where they had been and felt about . I shouted , and could not hear my own voice . I was deaf and alone in a universe filled solid with small stinging gray streaks . I panicked and began to blunder forward , mindcalling frantically , “
89421	89432	89250	89250	I	0	" Right under my hand , kneeling , he said , “
89444	89490	89491	89491	We	2828	” I did so , and never mentioned my minute of panic . No need to . This blizzard lasted two days ; there were five days lost , and there would be more . Nimmer and Anner are the months of the great storms . "

His firm , broad face showed weight - loss in deep shadows under the cheekbones , his eyes were sunken and his mouth sorely chapped and cracked . God knows what I looked like , when he looked like that . He smiled . “
89597	89667	89674	89674	Therem	460	” It was what he had said from the start . With all my anxieties , my sense of taking a last desperate gamble , and so on , I had not been realistic enough to believe him . Even now I thought , Surely , when we 've worked so hardBut the Ice did not know how hard we worked . Why should it ? Proportion is kept . "
89676	89701	89674	89674	Therem	460	" I said at last . He did not smile at that . Nor did he answer . Only after a while he said , “
89713	89758	89702	89702	I	0	" Down there , for us , had come to mean the south , the world below the plateau of ice , the region of earth , men , roads , cities , all of which had become hard to imagine as really existing . “

90255	90315	90233	90233	You	2838	” Our food was ready , and we fell to . Eating was so important and engrossing a business that we never talked any more while we ate ; the taboo was now in its complete , perhaps its original form , not a word said till the last crumb was gone . When it was , he said , “
90334	90335	90336	90336	Your	0	" "
90342	90358	90336	90336	Your	0	” I said , for there were certain things I had finally come to understand . “
90383	90394	90376	90376	I	0	” That amused him , but he was still brooding . “
90397	90403	90364	90364	Therem	460	" he said at last , "

90783	91440	90779	90779	he	2858	" Estraven said sternly . It was a fair response , on a world where no living thing is winged , and the very angels of the Yomesh Hierarchy of the Holy do not fly but only drift , wingless , down to earth like a soft snow falling , like the windborne seeds of that flowerless world . Towards the middle of Nimmer , after much wind and bitter cold , we came into a quiet weather for many days . If there was storm it was far south of us , down there , and we inside the blize zard had only an all but windless overcast . At first the overcast was thin , so that the air was vaguely radiant with an even , sourceless sunlight reflected from both clouds and snow , from above and below . Overnight the weather thickened somewhat . All brightness was gone , leaving nothing . We stepped out of the tent onto nothing . Sledge and tent were there , Estraven stood beside me , but neither he nor I cast any shadow . There was dull light all around , everywhere . When we walked on the crisp snow ng shadow showed the footprint . We left no track . Sledge , tent , himself , myself : nothing else at all . No sun , no sky , no horizon , no world . A whitish - gray void , in which we appeared to hang . The illusion was so complete that I had trouble keeping my balance . My inner ears were used to confirmation from my eyes as to how I stood ; they got none ; I might as well be blind . It was all right while we loaded up , but hauling , with nothing ahead , nothing to look at , nothing for the eye to touch , as it were , it was at first disagree able and then exhausting . We were on skis , on a good surface of fim , without sastrugi , and solid — that was certain — for five or six thousand feet down . We should have been making good time . But we kept slowing down , groping our way across the totally unobstructed plain , and it took a strong effort of will to speed up to 186 THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS a normal pace . Every slight variation in the surface came as a jolt , mely as in climbing stairs , the unexpected stair or the expected but absent stair - for we could not see it ahead : there was no shadow to show it . We skied blind with our eyes open . Day after day was like this , and we began to shorten our hauls , for by mid - afternoon both of us would be sweating and shaking with strain and fatigue . I came to long for snow , for blizzard , for anything ; but morning after morning we came out of the tent into the void , the white weather , what Estraven called the Unshadow . One day about noon , Odory Nimmer , the sixty - first day of the joumey , that bland blind nothingness about us began to flow and writhe . I thought my eyes were fooling me , as they had been doing often , and paid scant attention to the dim meaningless commotion of the air until , suddenly , I caught a glimpse of a small , wan , dead sun overhead . And looking down from the sun , straight ahead , I saw a huge black shape come hulking out of the void towards us . Black tentacles writhed upwards , groping out . I stopped dead in my tracks , slewing Estraven around on his skis , for we were both in harness hauling . “
91445	91463	90779	90779	he	2858	" He stared at the dark monstrous forms hidden in the fog , and said at last , “
91476	92038	90779	90779	he	2858	” And pulled on . We were miles from the things , which I had taken to be almost within arm 's reach . As the white weather turned to a thick low mist and then cleared off , we saw them plainly before sunset : nunataks , great scored and ravaged pinnacles of rock jutting up out of the ice , no more of them showing than shows of an iceberg above the sea : cold drowned mountains , dead for eons . They showed us to be somewhat north of our shortest course , if we could trust the ill - drawn map that was all we had . The next day we turned for the first time a little south of east , 187 19 . Homecoming IN A DARK windy weather we slogged along , trying to find encouragement in the sighting of Esherhoth Crags , the first thing not ice or snow or sky that we had seen for seven weeks . On the map they were marked as not far from the Shenshey Bogs to the south , and from Guthen Bay to the east . But it was not a trustworthy map of the Gobrin area . And we were getting very tired . We were nearer the southern edge of the Gobrin Glacier than the map indicated , for we began to meet pressure - ice and crevasses on the second day of our tum southward . The Ice was not so upheaved and tormented as in the Fire - Hills region , but it was rotten . There were sunken pits acres across , probably lakes in summer ; false floors of snow that might subside with a huge gasp all around you into the airpocket a foot deep beneath ; areas all slit and pocked with little holes and crevasses ; and , more and more often , there were big crevasses , old canyons in the Ice , some wide as mountain gorges and others only two or three feet across , but deep . On Odymny Nimmer ( by Estraven 's journal , for I kept none ) the sun shone clear with a strong north wind . As we ran the sledge across the snow - bridges over narrow crevasses we could look down to left or right into blue shafts and abysses in which bits of ice dislodged by the runners fell with a vast , faint , delicate music , as if silver wires touched thin crystal planes , falling . I remember the racy , dreamy , light - headed pleasure of that morning 's haul in the sunlight over the abysses . But the sky be gan to whiten , the air to grow thick ; shadows faded , blue drained out of the sky and snow . We were not alert to the danger of white weather on such a surface . As the ice was heavily cor- 188 THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS rugated , I was pushing while Estraven pulled ; I had my eyes on the sledge and was shoving away , mind on nothing but how best to shove , when all at once the bar was nearly wrenched out of my grip as the sledge shot forward in a sudden lunge . I held on by instinct and shouted "
92041	92348	90779	90779	he	2858	” to Estraven to slow him down , thinking he had speeded up on a smooth patch . But the sledge stopped dead , tilted nose - down , and Estraven was not there . I almost let go the sledge - bar to go look for him . It was pure luck that I did not . I held on , while I stared stupidly about for him , and so I saw the lip of the crevasse , made visible by the shifting and dropping of another section of the broken snow - bridge . He had gone right down feet - first , and nothing kept the sledge from following him but my weight , which held the rear third of the runner still on solid ice . It kept tipping a little farther nosedownward , pulled by his weight as he hung in harness in the pit . I brought my weight down on the rear - bar and pulled and rocked and levered the sledge back away from the edge of the crevasse . It did not come easy . But I threw my weight hard on the bar and tugged until it began grudgingly to move , and then slid abruptly right away from the crevasse . Estraven had got his hands onto the edge , and his weight now aided me . Scrambling , dragged by the harness , he came up over the edge and collapsed face down on the ice . I knelt by him trying to unbuckle his harness , alarmed by the way he sprawled there , passive except for the great gasping rise and fall of his chest . His lips were cyanotic , one side of his face was bruised and scraped . He sat up unsteadily and said in a whistling whisper , “
92356	92357	90779	90779	he	2858	" “
92360	92361	90779	90779	he	2858	" "

92380	92387	92388	92388	You	2861	” He started rebuckling his hamess . "
92400	92404	92388	92388	You	2861	" he gasped . “
92409	92591	92388	92388	You	2861	" Four hours one of us hauled while the other guided , mincing along like a cat on eggshells , sounding every step in advance with the stick . In the white weather one could not see a crevasse until one could look down into it - a little late , for the edges overhung , and were not always solid . Every footfall was a surprise , a drop or 189 THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS a jolt . No shadows . An even , white , soundless sphere : we moved along inside a huge frosted - glass ball . There was nothing inside the ball , and nothing was outside it . But there were cracks in the glass . Probe and step , probe and step . Probe for the invisible cracks through which one might fall out of the white glass ball , and fall , and fall , and fall . ... An unrelaxable tension little by little took hold of all my muscles . It became exceedingly difficult to take even one more step . “
92598	92620	92596	92596	Genry	415	" I stood there in the middle of nothing . Tears came out and froze my eyelids together . I said , “
92627	92628	92621	92621	I	0	" "
