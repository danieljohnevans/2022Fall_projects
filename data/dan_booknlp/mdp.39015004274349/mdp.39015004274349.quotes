582	626	627	627	She	52	" It 's an absolute f xation . I expect they all carry those bent mirrors around in their coat pockets and peer into their own mouths every time they go to the John to make sure they 're still cavity - free . "

2057	2105	2054	2054	Ainsley	52	" Or the i.o.d.e . I 'll bet she was n't at a meeting at all ; she was hiding behind that damn velvet curtain , wanting us to think she was at a meeting so we'p really do something . What she wants is an orgy . "

2437	2457	2434	2434	she	203	" I would sell the house . But I want the child to grow up in a good district . "
2522	2532	2533	2533	she	203	" But that has n't reached our street yet , "

3699	3704	3705	3705	she	65	" Ah , Marian , "
3708	3740	3705	3705	she	65	" you 're just in time . I need another pre - test taster for the canned rice pudding study , and none of the ladies seem very hungry this morning . "
3809	3910	3911	3911	I	0	" You work on questionnaires , Marian , maybe you can help us . We ca n't decide whether to have them taste all three flavours at the same meal , or each flavour separately at subsequent meals . Or perhaps we could have them taste in pairs - say , Vanilla and Orange at one meal , and Vanilla and Caramel at another . Of course we want to get as unbiased a sampling as possible , and so much depends on what else has been served - the colours of the vegetables for instance , and the tablecloth . "
3916	3926	3927	3927	she	65	" How would you rate the colour on that ? "
3934	3944	3927	3927	she	65	" Natural , Somewhat Artificial , or Definitely Unnatural ? "
3945	3955	3956	3956	I	0	" Have you thought about putting raisins in it ? "
3972	3978	3979	3979	she	65	" Raisins are too risky , "
3982	3989	3979	3979	she	65	" Many do n't like them . "
4000	4011	4012	4012	I	0	" Are you going to have them serve it hot ? "
4015	4021	4012	4012	I	0	" Or maybe with cream ? "
4023	4037	4038	4038	siie	66	" Well , it 's intended primarily for the time - saver market , "
4041	4096	4038	4038	siie	66	" They naturally would want to serve it cold . They can add cream if they like , later , I mean we 've nothing really against . & though it 's not nutritionally necessary , it 's fortified with vitamiij * already , but right now we want a pure taste - test . "
4097	4106	4107	4107	I	0	" I think subsequent meals would be best , "
4110	4134	4135	4135	She	65	" If we could only do it in the middle of the afternoon . But we need a family reaction . . . . "
4149	4154	4155	4155	I	0	" Yes , well , "
4158	4166	4155	4155	I	0	" I 'd better be getting back . "
4282	4294	4300	4300	I	0	" In what percentile would you place the visual impact value ? "
4978	4984	4985	4985	she	70	" Well , Miss MacAlpin , "
4988	5011	4985	4985	she	70	" you 've been with us fo\|ir months now , and that means you 're eligible for the Pension Plan . ' ; "
5015	5035	4985	4985	she	70	" I had been told about the Pension Plan when joined the company but I had forgotten about it . "
5061	5063	5054	5054	you	70	" 20 "
5079	5107	5108	5108	I	0	" Mrs. Grot said . Her eyes behind their rimless spectacles were glittering : she would relish the chance of making yet another deduction from my paycheque . "
5121	5125	5127	5127	you	70	" I said . "
5130	5131	5127	5127	you	70	" "
5144	5154	5141	5141	you	0	" she said in a matter - offact voice . "
5167	5168	5157	5157	You	0	" "
5210	5654	5655	5655	I	0	" \ I signed , but after Mrs. Grot had left I was suddenly quite depressed ; it bothered me more than it should have . It was n't only the feeling of being subject to rules I had no interest in and no part in making : you get adjusted to that at school . It was a kind of superstitious panic about the fact that I had actually signed my name , had put my signature to a magic document which seemed to bind me to a future so far ahead I could n't think about it . Somewhere in front of me a self was waiting , pre - formed , a self who had worked during innumerable years for Seymour Surveys and was now receiving her reward . A pension . I foresaw a bleak room with a plug - in electric heater . Perhaps I would have a hearing aid , like one of my great - aunts who had never married . I would talk to myself ; children would throw snowballs at me . I told myself not to be silly , the world would probably blow up between now and then ; I reminded myself I could walk out of there the next day and get a different job if I wanted to , but that did n't help . I thought of my signature going intb a file and the file going into a cabinet and the cabinet being shut away in a vault somewhere and locked . t welcomed the coffee break at ten - thirty . I knew I ought to have skipped it and stayed to expiate my morning 's lateness , but I needed the distraction . a go for coffee with the only three people in the department who arje almost my own age . Sometimes Ainsley walks over from her office to join us , when she is tired of the other toothbrush - testers . ls}ot that she 's especially fond of the three from my office , whom she 21 calls collectively the office virgins . They are n't really very much alike , except that they are all artificial blondes - Emmy , the typist , whisk - tinted and straggly ; Lucy , who has a kind of public - relations job , platinum and elegantly coiffured , and Millie , Mrs. Bogue 's Australian assistant , brassy from the sun and cropped - and , as they have confessed at various times over coffee - grounds and the gnawed crusts of toasted Danishes , all virgins - Millie from a solid girlguide practicality ( "
5678	5686	5689	5689	people	226	" ) , Lucy from social quailing ( "
5692	5790	5689	5689	people	226	" ) , which seems to be rooted in a conviction that all bedrooms are wired for sound , with society gathered at the other end tuning its earphones ; and Emmy , who is the office hypochondriac , from the belief that it would make her sick , which it probably would . They are all interested in travelling : Millie has lived in England , Lucy has been twice to New York , and Emmy wants to go to Florida . After they have travelled enough they would like to get married and settle down . "
5803	5826	5689	5689	people	226	" Millie said when we were seated at our usual table at the wretched , but closest , restaurant across the street . "
5853	5861	5689	5689	people	226	" Millie always gets the news first . "
5872	5876	5863	5863	I	0	" Emmy sniffed . "
5892	5973	6030	6030	They	346	" She went back to peeling the nailpolish off her thumbnail . Emmy alyays looks as though she is coming unravelled . Stray threads trail from her hems , her lipstick sloughs off in dry scales , she sheds wispy blonde hairs and flakes of scalp on her shoulders and back ; everywhere she goes she leaves a trail of assorted shreds . I I saw Ainsley come in and waved to her . She squeezed into pe booth , saying "
5975	6002	6003	6003	They	346	" all round , then pinned up a strand of hair tjhat had come down . The office virgins responded , but without marked enthusiasm . > "
6009	6025	6003	6003	They	346	" Millie said . She 's been at the company longer than any of us . "
6062	6064	6055	6055	they	346	" 22 "
6069	6073	6055	6055	they	346	" said Ainsley . "
6087	6125	6080	6080	she	352	" Lucy said , loudly enough so the waitress would overhear . She carries on a running battle with the waitress , who wears Woolworth earrings and a sullen scowl and is blatantly not an office virgin . "
6132	6171	6080	6080	she	352	" I said privately to Ainsley . The waitress arrived , wiped the table savagely , and took our orders . Lucy made an issue of the toasted Danish - she definitely wanted one without raisins this time . "
6181	6208	6174	6174	she	352	" she informed us , and I told her I just could n't stand them . I 've never been able to stand raisins . Ugh . "
6209	6214	6215	6215	Ainsley	52	" Why only Quebec ? "
6225	6232	6215	6215	Ainsley	52	" Is there some psychological reason ? "
6240	6248	6250	6250	Millie	71	" Gosh , I do n't know , "
6252	6271	6250	6250	Millie	71	" I guess people are just more constipated there . Do n't they eat a lot of potatoes ? "
6272	6280	6282	6282	Emmy	71	" Would potatoes make you that constipated ? "
6318	6327	6328	6328	Ainsley	52	" It ca n't be only the potatoes , "
6331	6355	6328	6328	Ainsley	52	" It must be their collective guilt - complex . Or maybe the strain of the languageproblem ; they must be horribly repressed . "
6374	6382	6384	6384	Millie	71	" It 's awfully hot out today , "
6394	6395	6384	6384	Millie	71	" "
6402	6418	6384	6384	Millie	71	" I asked Ainsley , to break the tension . Ainsley ground out her cigarette . "
6431	6435	6436	6437	Some woman	357	" she said . "
6512	6563	6505	6505	he	358	" 1 suspected Ainsley of making this story up , but her eyes were at thiir bluest and roundest . The office virgins squirmed . Ainsley has * 3 an offhand way of alluding to the various men in her life that makes them uncomfortable . Luckily our orders arrived . "
6573	6617	6564	6565	That bitch	363	" Lucy wailed , and began picking them out with her long perfectly - shaped irridescent fingernails and piling them at the side of her plate . As we were walking back to the office I complained to Millie about the Pension Plan . "
6626	6630	6618	6618	I	0	" I said . "
6661	6662	6652	6653	Mrs. Grot	70	" "
6673	6679	6652	6653	Mrs. Grot	70	" Millie said without interest . "
6692	6741	6742	6742	Marian	112	" I had returned from lunch and was licking and stamping envelopes for the coast - to - coast instant pudding - sauce study , behind schedule because someone in mimeo had run one of the question sheets backwards , when Mrs. Bogue came out of her cubicle . "
6744	6753	6742	6742	Marian	112	" she said with a sigh of resignation , "
6771	6789	6767	6767	She	73	" Mrs. Bogue frowned slightly : she regards pregnancy as an act of disloyalty to the company . "
6795	6861	6767	6767	She	73	" I said . The huge wall - map of the country , sprinkled with red thumbtacks like measles , is directly above my desk , which means that the subtraction and addition of interviewers seems to have become part of my job . I climbed up on the desk , located Kamloops , and took out the thumbtack with the paper flag marked dodge . "
6868	6873	6875	6875	you	112	" Mrs. Bogue said , "
6960	7009	7010	7010	Marian	112	" When I had climbed down she smiled at me pleasantly , which put me on guard . Mrs. Bogue has a friendly , almost cosy manner that equips her perfectly for dealing with the interviewers , and she is at her most genial when she wants something . "
7012	7016	7010	7010	Marian	112	" she said , "
7110	7111	7108	7108	you	112	" "
7120	7127	7108	7108	you	112	" I asked , somewhat pointlessly . "
7149	7159	7144	7147	seven or eight men	372	" My lateness that morning had given her leverage . "
7162	7166	7144	7147	seven or eight men	372	" I said , "
7173	7174	7167	7167	I	0	" "
7183	7652	7175	7175	You	112	" Mrs. Bogue said as she walked away , leaving me wondering whether that had been a snide remark . Her voice is always so bland it 's hard to tell . I finished licking the envelopes , then got the beer questionnaires from Millie and went through the questions , looking for troublespots . The initial selection questions were standard enough . After that , the questions were designed to test listener response to a radio jingle , part of the advertising campaign for a new brand of beer one of the large companies was about to launch on the market . At a certain point the interviewer had to ask the respondent to pick up the telephone and dial a given number , whereupon the jingle would play itself to him over the phone . Then there were a number of questions asking the man how he liked the commercial , whether he thought it might influence his buying habits , and so on ! } ' . dialled the phone number . Since the survey was n't actually being conducted till the next week , someone might have forgotten to hejok up the record , and I did n't want to make an idiot of myself . * 5 After a preliminary ringing , buzzing and clicking a deep bass voice , accompanied by what sounded like an electric guitar , sang : Moose , Moose , From the land of pine and spruce , Tingly , heady , rough - and - ready , ... Then a speaking voice , almost as deep as the singer 's , intoned persuasively to background music , I Any real man An a real man 's holiday - hunting , fishing , or just plain ^dffl - fdshioned relaxing - needs a beer with a healthy , hearty taste , a deepdown manly flavour . The first long cool swallow will tell you that Moose Beer is just what you 've always wanted for true beer enjoyment . Put the tang of the wilderness in your life today with a big satisfying glass of sturdy Moose Beer . The singer resumed : Tingly , heady , Rough - and - ready , Moose , Moose , Moose , Moose , beer ! ! ! and after a climax of sound the record clicked off . It was in satisfactory working order . I remembered the sketches I 'd seen of the visual presentation , scheduled to appear in magazines and on posters : the label was to have a pair of antlers with a gun and a fishing - rod crossed beneath them . The singing commercial was a reinforcement of this theme ; I did n't think it was very original but I admired the subtlety of "
7660	7740	7175	7175	You	112	" That was so the average beerdrinker , the slope - shouldered pot - bellied kind , would be able to feel a mystical identity with the plaid - jacketed sportsman shown in the pictures with his foot on a deer or scooping a trout into , his net . I had got to the last page when the telephone rang . It was Peter . I could tell from the sound of his voice that something iwas wrong . "
7754	7756	7745	7745	I	0	" \ "
7759	7828	7745	7745	I	0	" I said , wanting further explanation . I was disappointed , 26 I had been looking forward to dinner with Peter to cheer me up . Also I was hungry again . I had been eating in bits and pieces all day and I had been counting on something nourishing and substantial . This meant another of the t.v . dinners Ainsley and I kept for emergencies . "
7833	7834	7835	7835	I	0	" "
7842	7848	7849	7849	Trigger	77	" - his voice choked - "
7854	7855	7849	7849	Trigger	77	" "
7858	7866	7849	7849	Trigger	77	" I said . I thought of saying "
7872	7900	7849	7849	Trigger	77	" but it did n't seem adequate . There was no use in sympathizing as though for a minor mishap when it was really a national disaster . "
7910	7917	7902	7902	you	0	" I asked , offering support . "
7921	7925	7902	7902	you	0	" he said , "
7940	8258	7932	7932	I	0	" When he had hung up I reflected upon the consequences . The most obvious one was that Peter would need careful handling the next evening . Trigger was one of Peter 's oldest friends ; in fact , he had been the last of Peter 's group of oldest friends still left unmarried . It had been like an epidemic . Just before I 'd met him two had succumbed , and in the four months since that another two had gone under without much warning . He and Trigger had found themselves more and more alone on their bachelor drinking sessions during the summer , and when the others did take an evening off from their wives to go along , I gathered from Peter 's gloomy accounts that the flavour of the evening was a synthetic substitute for the irresponsible gaiety of the past . He and Trigger had clutched each other like drowning men , each trying to make the other the reassuring reflection of himself that he needed . Now Trigger had sunk and the mirror would be empty . There were the other law students of course , but most of them were married too . Besides , they belonged to Peter 's post - university silver age rather than to his earlier golden one . i ! felt sorry for him , but I knew I would have to be wary . If the , other two marriages had been any indication , he 'd start seeing me ] after two or three drinks as a version of the designing siren wh / o had carried off Trigger . I did n't dare ask how she had done it : he /might think I was getting ideas . The best plan would be to dis / bract him . 27 While I was meditating Lucy came over to my desk . "
8273	8277	8260	8260	you	373	" she asked . "
8296	8366	8285	8285	I	0	" She pressed one elegant hand to her forehead ; with the other she handed me a note written in pencil on a piece of cardboard . I read it : Dear Sir , The cereal was fine but I found this in with the raisins . Yours Truly , { Mrs. ) Ramona Baldwin . A squashed housefly was scotch - taped to the bottom of the letter . "
8375	8387	8285	8285	I	0	" Lucy said faintly . She was playing on my sympathies . "
8393	8397	8399	8399	you	0	" I said ; "
8404	8521	8522	8522	Clara	81	" I made several trial drafts : Dear Mrs. Baldwin ; We are extremely sorry about the object in your cereal but these little mistakes will happen . Dear Mrs. Baldwin ; We are so sorry to have inconvenienced you ; we assure you however that the entire contents of the package was absolutely sterile . Dear Mrs. Baldwin ; We are grateful to you for calling this matter to our attention as we always like to know about any errors we may have made . The main thing , I knew , was to avoid calling the housefly by its actual name . The phone rang again ; this time it was an unexpected voice . "
8524	8534	8522	8522	Clara	81	" I exclaimed , conscious of having neglected her . "
8538	8539	8522	8522	Clara	81	" "
8544	8548	8522	8522	Clara	81	" Clara said . "
8569	8570	8559	8559	I	0	" "
8576	8596	8571	8571	I	0	" I said , my enthusiasm half - genuine : it would be better than a t.v . dinner . "

8609	8613	8571	8571	I	0	" Clara said . "
8628	8677	8618	8618	We	377	" She sounded bitter . Now I was committed I was thinking rapidly of what this wduld involve : I was being invited as an entertainer and confidante , someone who would listen to a recital of Clara 's problems , arid I did n't feel like it . "
8691	8702	8688	8688	I	0	" That is , if she is n't doing anything . "
8754	8760	8761	8761	Clara	81	" Sure , why not ? "
8764	8775	8761	8761	Clara	81	" The more the merrier , that 's our motto . "
8859	8868	8869	8869	I	0	" So you are n't doing anything then , "
8876	8881	8883	8883	Ainsley	52	" Well , no , "
8885	8891	8883	8883	Ainsley	52	" unless something comes along . "
8892	8907	8908	8908	I	0	" Then why do n't you come with me to Clara 's for dinner ? "
8992	8999	9000	9000	Lucy	72	" Going out tonight , Marian ? "
9017	9020	9021	9021	I	0	" Yes , "
9260	9269	9270	9270	she	52	" Do n't be so concerned , Marian , "
9273	9282	9270	9270	she	52	" you make me feel like an invalid . "
9442	9448	9449	9449	Ainsley	52	" Christ it 's hot , "
9534	9538	9539	9539	I	0	" Hi Joe , "
9541	9554	9539	9539	I	0	" here we are . How 's Clara feeling ? 3 3 ° "
9561	9572	9573	9573	Clara	81	" he said , stepping aside to let us past . "
9578	9764	9539	9539	I	0	" We walked the length of the house , which was arranged in the way such houses usually are - living - room in front , then diningroom with doors that can be slid shut , then kitchen - stepping over some of the scattered obstacles and around the others . We negotiated the stairs of the back porch , which were overgrown with empty bottles of all kinds , beer bottles , milk bottles , wine and scotch bottles , and baby bottles , and found Clara in the garden , sitting in a round wicker basket - chair with metal legs . She had her feet up on another chair and was holding her latest baby somewhere in the vicinity of what had once been her lap . Clara 's body is so thin that her pregnancies are always bulgingly obvious , and now in her seventh month she looked like a boa - constrictor that has swallowed a watermelon . Her head , with its aureole of pale hair , was made to seem smaller and even more fragile by the contrast . "
9768	9780	9539	9539	I	0	" she said wearily as we came down the back steps . "
9795	9950	9951	9951	Marian	112	" We agreed , and sat down on the grass near her , since there were no chairs . Ainsley and I took off our shoes ; Clara was already bare- j \ \j foot . We found it difficult to talk : everyone 's attention was neces- fe sarily focussed on the baby , which was whimpering , and for some time it was the only person who said anything . When she telephoned Clara had seemed to be calling me to some sort of rescue , but I felt now that there was nothing much I could do , and nothing she had even expected me to do . I was to be only a witness , or perhaps a kind of blotter , my mere physical presence absorbing a little of the boredom . The baby had ceased to whine and was now gurgling . Ainsley was plucking bits of grass . "
9953	9959	9951	9951	Marian	112	" Clara said at last , "
9985	9986	9968	9968	She	84	" "
9992	10012	9987	9987	I	0	" said Ainsley unexpectedly . Cfeta pried the baby away from her body and transferred it to Ainslpy , saying "
10034	10153	10023	10023	she	84	" She lay back in her chair .b.w.—± $ i and closed her eyes , looking like a strange vegetable growth , a bulbous tuber that had sent out four thin white roots and a tiny pale - yellow flower . A cicada was singing in a tree nearby , its monotonous vibration like a hot needle of sunlight between the ears . Ainsley held the baby awkwardly , gazing with curiosity into its face . I thought how closely the two faces resembled each other . The baby stared back up with eyes as round and blue as Ainsley 's own ; the pink mouth was drooling slightly . Clara raised her head and opened her eyes . "
10162	10172	10157	10157	I	0	" she asked , remembering she was the hostess . "
10180	10198	10157	10157	I	0	" I said hastily , alarmed by the image of her struggling up out of the chair . "
10207	10217	10202	10202	I	0	" I would have felt better doing something positive . "
10224	10231	10218	10218	Joe	82	" she said as if explaining . "
10242	10243	10202	10202	I	0	" "
10247	10308	10202	10202	I	0	" I said . I sat trying to think of things that would entertain her , but anything I could mention , the office or places I had been or the furnishings of the apartment , would only remind Clara of her own inertia , her lack of room and time , her days made claustrophobic with small necessary details . "
10341	10342	10333	10333	he	411	" "
10347	10348	10345	10345	Peter	53	" "
10353	10363	10350	10350	she	411	" said Ainsley , with a hint of disapproval . "
10369	10394	10364	10364	He	411	" She was sitting cross - legged , and now she put the baby down in her lap so she could light a cigarette . "
10399	10404	10364	10364	He	411	" Clara said gloomily . "
10426	10427	10419	10419	He	411	" "
10437	10449	10455	10455	he	411	" I was annoyed that he had n't called me too . "
10475	10476	10477	10477	He	411	" "
10483	10488	10477	10477	He	411	" I said drily . "
10508	10510	10505	10505	he	411	" i "
10515	10520	10513	10513	he	411	" Ainsley asked . | "
10532	10554	10513	10513	he	411	" I said quickly . I could n't 3 * think of two people who would be worse for each other . "
10566	10567	10568	10568	He	411	" "
10577	10581	10568	10568	He	411	" said Clara . "
10620	10621	10611	10611	He	411	" "
10628	10632	10611	10611	He	411	" Ainsley said . "
10639	10649	10633	10633	They	421	" She stubbed out her cigarette in the grass . "
10664	10673	10660	10660	he	411	" Clara said , with something like vivacity . "
10696	10697	10660	10660	he	411	" "
10700	10720	10660	10660	he	411	" I said , not surprised . Ainsley gave a little cry and deposited the baby on the lawn . "
10728	10733	10660	10660	he	411	" she said accusingly . "
10742	10784	10736	10736	they	424	" said Clara . The baby began to howl , and I picked her up gingerly and handed her over to Clara . I was prepared to be helpful , but only up to a point . Clara joggled the baby . "
10793	10798	10799	10799	You	422	" she said soothingly . "
10851	10858	10844	10844	they	429	" she added grimly to us . "
10877	10898	10899	10899	Anybody	348	" Joe appeared on the back porch , a dishtowel tucked apron - like into the belt of his trousers . "
10906	10918	10899	10899	Anybody	348	" Ainsley and I said Yes eagerly , and Clara said , "
10954	10966	10942	10942	Joe	82	" Joe came down the steps and picked up the baby . "
10971	10975	10942	10942	Joe	82	" he said , "
10987	10988	10985	10985	you	0	" "
11002	11018	11021	11021	he	435	" Clara asked/ as Joe disappeared into the house ; it seemed a rhetorical question . "
11043	11101	11041	11041	darling	434	" she called languidly . Dqwn at the end of the narrow garden the line of washing that 33 hung almost brushing the ground was parted by two small grubbyhands , and Clara 's firstborn emerged . Like the baby he was naked except for a pair of diapers . He hesitated , peering at us dubiously . "
11117	11121	11108	11108	mummy	437	" Clara said . "
11130	11201	11123	11123	your	434	" she added without conviction . Arthur picked his way over the grass towards us , lifting his bare feet high with every step . The grass must have been ticklish . His diaper was loose , suspended as though by will - power alone below the bulge of his stomach with its protruding navel . His face was puckered in a serious frown . Joe returned carrying a tray . "
11210	11214	11202	11202	I	0	" he said . "
11223	11245	11215	11215	She	438	" Arthur had reached us and stood beside his mother 's chair , still frowning , and Clara said to him , "
11258	11269	11248	11248	you	434	" She reached down behind him and felt his diaper . "
11275	11279	11280	11280	he	434	" she sighed , "
11306	11323	11293	11293	I	0	" Joe handed round the drinks , then knelt and said to Arthur firmly but kindly , "
11331	11378	11293	11293	I	0	" Arthur gazed up at him , not sure whether to whimper or smile . Finally he stalked portentously to the side of the garden , where he squatted down near a clump of dusty red chrysanthemums and stared with concentration at a patch of ground . "
11385	11396	11381	11383	a good boy	442	" Joe said , and went back into the house . "
11414	11420	11421	11421	He	434	" Clara said to us . "
11460	11466	11467	11467	We	446	" She closed her eyes . "
11530	11553	11521	11521	he	434	" i We watched , sipping our beer , as Joe crossed the garden and returned with a folded piece of newspaper . "
11564	11662	11557	11557	I	0	" said Clara . 34 When Joe had finally finished cooking the dinner we went into the house and ate it , seated around the heavy table in the diningroom . The baby had been fed and exiled to the carriage on the front porch , but Arthur sat in a highchair , where he evaded with spastic contortions of his body the spoonfuls of food Clara poked in the direction of his mouth . Dinner was wizened meat balls and noodles from a noodle mix , with lettuce . For dessert we had something I recognized . "
11678	11683	11773	11773	They	449	" Clara said defensively . "
11697	11698	11693	11693	Arthur	88	" "
11701	11705	11693	11693	Arthur	88	" I said . "
11717	11718	11693	11693	Arthur	88	" "
11721	11751	11693	11693	Arthur	88	" Clara deftly intercepted a long drool of pudding and returned it to Arthur 's mouth . Ainsley got out a cigarette and held it for Joe to light . "
11755	11761	11693	11693	Arthur	88	" she said to him , "
11781	11809	11773	11773	They	449	" Joe had been up and down all during the meal , taking off the plates , and tending things in the kitchen . He looked dizzy . "
11817	11821	11815	11815	him	87	" he said , "
11832	11864	11823	11823	he	87	" He finished his pudding quickly and asked Clara whether she needed any help , but she did n't hear him . Arthur had just thrown his bowl on the floor . "
11872	11914	11867	11867	doyou	453	" Ainsley asked , as though appealing to his superior intelligence . Joe stared at the wall , thinking . He did n't like giving negative judgments , I knew , but I also knew he was n't fond of Len . "
11920	11933	11915	11915	He	87	" he said at last . Joe is an Instructor in Philosophy . "
11942	12001	12002	12002	He	87	" I said . Len had never been unethical towards me . Joe frowned at me . He does n't know Ainsley very well , and tends * anyway to think of all unmarried girls as easily victimized and needing protection . He had several times volunteered fatherly adviife to me , and now he emphasized his point . "
12012	12030	12002	12002	He	87	" he said sternly . Ainsley gave a short laugp and blew out smoke , unperturbed . 35 "
12035	12039	12002	12002	He	87	" I said , "
12049	12223	12040	12040	you	455	" After dinner we went to sit in the littered living - room while Joe cleared the table . I offered to help , but Joe said that was all right , he would rather I talked to Clara . Clara had settled herself on the chesterfield in a nest of crumpled newspapers with her eyes closed ; again I could think of little to say . I sat staring up at the centre of the ceiling where there was an elaborately - scrolled plaster decoration , once perhaps the setting for a chandelier , remembering Clara at highschool : a tall fragile girl who was always getting exempted from Physical Education . She 'd sit on the sidelines watching the rest of us in our blue - bloomered gymsuits as though anything so sweaty and ungainly was foreign enough to her to be a ■ ^ mildly - amusing entertainment . In that classroom full of oily y potato - chip - fattened adolescents she was everyone 's ideal of trans- < £ "
12686	12689	12684	12684	Joe	82	" an accident "
12697	12703	12704	12704	Clara	81	" It was no accident , "
12711	12750	12751	12751	Joe	82	" He just loves peeing behind doors . I wonder what it is . He 's going to be secretive when he grows up , an undercover agent or a diplomat or something . The furtive little bastard . "
12767	12777	12778	12778	he	82	" You must come and see us again soon , "
12781	12793	12778	12778	he	82	" Clara has so few people she can really talk to . "
12871	12877	12878	12878	I	0	" Dinner was n't bad , "
12898	12908	12886	12886	Clara	81	" Joe 's turning into quite a go^d cook . "
12910	12917	12918	12918	Ainsley	52	" How can she stand if ? "
12926	12948	12918	12918	Ainsley	52	" She just lies there and that man does all the work ! She lets : herself be treated like a thing?9 "
12957	12961	12918	12918	Ainsley	52	" I said . "
12969	12970	12971	12971	She	52	" "
12976	12981	12982	12982	She	52	" Ainsley said indignantly . "
13018	13019	13011	13011	She	52	" "
13025	13043	13022	13022	you	52	" I said . I was annoyed with Ainsley : she could n't see Clara 's position . "
13088	13118	13119	13119	I	0	" I remembered poor Clara 's resolutions after the first baby : she had thought of it as only a temporary absence . After the second she had wailed , "
13136	13197	13199	13200	a housewife	484	" . She had always been against the pill - she thought it might change her personality - but gradually she had become less adamant . She had read a French novel ( in translation ) and a book about archaeological expeditions in Peru and had talked about night school . Lately she had taken to making bitter remarks about being "
13201	13203	13199	13200	a housewife	484	" . "
13207	13211	13212	13212	you	52	" I said , "
13226	13227	13212	13212	you	52	" "
13237	13241	13212	13212	you	52	" Ainsley said , "
13254	13298	13249	13249	She	52	" When we were back at the apartment I thought of Len , and decided it was n't too late to call him . He was in , and after we 'd exchanged greetings I told him I would love to see him . "
13301	13305	13249	13249	She	52	" he said , "
13331	13332	13316	13316	I	0	" "
13341	13358	13334	13334	you	0	" I said , hinting that I knew why he had and giving him an opening . "
13363	13372	13334	13334	you	0	" he said with a touch of smugness . "
13384	13393	13334	13334	you	0	" He had acquired a slight English accent . "
13408	13409	13410	13410	She	486	" "
13416	13439	13410	13410	She	486	" I said . Ainsley had gone into the livingroom and was sitting on the chesterfield with her back to me . 38 "
13452	13466	13442	13442	you	0	" My being too old was one of his jokes . I laughed . "
13473	13492	13442	13442	you	0	" I said . It had suddenly struck me that Len would be a perfect distraction for Peter . "
13512	13513	13505	13506	a friend	259	" "
13516	13520	13505	13506	a friend	259	" said Len , "
13534	13535	13532	13532	you	0	" "
13543	13558	13532	13532	you	0	" I said to reassure him . When I had hung up Ainsley said , "
13568	13573	13532	13532	you	0	" I said yes . "
13580	13593	13576	13576	he	490	" she asked casually . I could n't refuse to tell her . "
13621	13622	13623	13623	I	0	" "
13627	13637	13610	13610	He	490	" She got up and went into the kitchen . "
13642	13646	13610	13610	He	490	" she called . "
13650	13654	13610	13610	He	490	" I said , "
13665	13713	13714	13714	Marian	112	" I moved into the living - room and went to the window seat where there was a breeze . She came back in with a scotch on the rocks for herself and handed me my glass of water . Then she sat down on the floor . "
13716	13720	13714	13714	Marian	112	" she said , "
13730	13742	13724	13724	I	0	" Her voice was so serious that I was immediately worried . "
13747	13748	13724	13724	I	0	" "
13757	13781	13782	13782	I	0	" she said quietly . I took a quick drink of water . I could n't imagine Ainsley making a miscalculation like that . "
13788	13792	13786	13786	you	112	" She laughed . "
13813	13821	13822	13822	You	0	" I was relieved , but puzzled . "
13831	13871	13824	13824	you	0	" I asked , thinking of Trigger 's misfortune . I tried to guess which of them Ainsley could be interested in , without success ; ever since I 'd known her she had been decidely anti - marriage . "
13879	13886	13874	13874	you	112	" she said with amused contempt . "
13966	13967	13963	13964	the father	497	" "
13973	13977	13978	13978	He	82	" I cried . "
13993	13994	13991	13991	him	82	" "
13997	14001	13991	13991	him	82	" said Ainsley . "
14049	14050	14039	14039	she	81	" "
14057	14061	14039	14039	she	81	" I protested . "
14071	14072	14039	14039	she	81	" "
14075	14080	14039	14039	she	81	" Ainsley said darkly , "
14159	14188	14189	14189	Ainsley	52	" It seemed to me that the discussion had got off the track : we were talking theory about a practical matter . I tried a personal attack : "
14221	14222	14212	14212	you	52	" "
14230	14234	14212	14212	you	52	" said Ainsley , "
14245	14332	14212	14212	you	52	" I could n't deny this . I was baffled : I did n't even know how to justify my own opposition to her plan . The worst of it was that she would probably do it . She can go about getting what she wants with a great deal of efficiency , though in my opinion some of the things she wants - and this was a case in point - are unreasonable . I decided to take a down - to - earth approach . "
14336	14340	14212	14212	you	52	" I said . "
14362	14370	14355	14355	you	52	" She gave me a disgusted look . "
14395	14418	14392	14393	one baby	510	" She sounded like a voice on the radio saying that every woman should have a£ least one electric hair - dryer . "
14433	14472	14351	14351	Ainsley	52	" Ainsley is fond of paper - back books by anthropologists about primitive cultures : there are several of them bogged down among the clothes on her floor . At her college they make you take courses ink . "
14477	14487	14351	14351	Ainsley	52	" I said , searching my mind for objections . "
14502	14523	14351	14351	Ainsley	52	" I held them out to her like a carrot to a donkey . Ainsley widened her eyes at me . "

14632	14874	14625	14625	you	511	" I said . I looked around the living - room , calculating already how much time , energy and money it would take to pack and move the furniture . I had contributed most of the solider items : the heavy round coffee table donated from a relative 's attic back home , the walnut drop - leaf we used for company , also a donation , the stuffed easy - chair and the chesterfield I had picked up at the Salvation Army and re - covered . The outsize poster of Theda Bara and the bright paper flowers were Ainsley 's ; so were the ash trays and the inflatable plastic cushions with geometric designs . Peter said our living - room lacked unity . I had never thought of it as a permanent arrangement , but now it was threatened it took on a desirable stability for me . The tables planted their legs more firmly on the floor ; it was inconceivable that the round coffee table could ever be manipulated down those narrow stairs , that the poster of Theda Bara could be rolled up , revealing the crack in the plaster , that the plastic cushions could allow themselves to be deflated and stowed away in a trunk . I wondered whether the lady down below would consider Ainsley 's pregnancy a breach of contract and take legal action . 4i Ainsley was getting sulky . "

15169	15174	15129	15129	I	0	" I said finally , "

15231	15239	15218	15218	You	0	" she said , taking me seriously , "

15433	15449	15450	15450	You	539	" I said , trying to be helpful . Ainsley looked at me with annoyance . "
15455	15459	15450	15450	You	539	" she said . "
15533	16130	15528	15528	they	226	" I was beginning to feel fuzzy in the brain . I knew Ainsley was wrong , but she sounded so rational . I thought I 'd better go to bed before she had convinced me against my better judgment . In my room , I sat on the bed with my back against the wall , thinking . At first I tried to concentrate on ways to stop her , but then I became resigned . Her mind was made up , and though I could hope this was just a whim she would get over , was it any of my business ? I would simply have to adjust to the situation . Perhaps when we had to move I should get another room - mate ; but would it be right to leave Ainsley on her own ? I did n't want to behave irresponsibly . I got into bed , feeling unsettled . 6 ^i C ' p s. The alarm clock startled me out of a dream in which I had looked o down and seen my feet beginning to dissolve , like melting jelly , ^ vsh £ and had put on a pair of rubber boots just in time only to find thatN ^ f the ends of my fingers were turning transparent . I had started ® < ? towards the mirror to see what was happening to my face , but at that point I woke up . I do n't usually remember my dreams . Ainsley was still asleep , so I boiled my egg and drank my tomato juice and coffee alone . Then I dressed in an outfit suitable for interviewing , an official - looking skirt , a blouse with sleeves , and a 43 pair of low - heeled walking shoes . I intended to get an early start , but I could n't be too ^Ajot^omcn , who would want to sleep in on the holiday , would n't be up yet . I got out my map of the city and studied it , mentally crossing off the areas I knew had been selected for the actual survey . I had some toast and a second cup of coffee , and traced out several possible routes for myself . What I needed was seven or eight men with a certain minimum average beer consumption per week , who would be willing to answer the questions . Locating them might be more difficult than usual , because of the long weekend . I knew from experience that men were usually more unwilling than women to play the questionnaire game . The streets near the apartment were out : word might get back to the lady down below that I had been asking the neighbours how much beer they drank . Also , I suspected that it was a scotch area rather than a beer one ; with a sprinkling of teetotalling widows . The rooming - house district further west was out , too : I had tried it once for a potato - chip taste - test and found the landladies very hostile . They seemed to think I was a government agent in disguise , trying to raise their tax by discovering they had more lodgers than they claimed . I considered the fraternity houses near the university , but remembered the study demanded answerers over the age - limit . I took the bus , got off at the subway station , paused to note down my fare as "
16132	16623	15528	15528	they	226	" on my expenses time - sheet , and crossed the street . Then I went down a slope into the flat treeless park spread out opposite the station . There was a baseball diamond in one corner , but nobody was playing on it . The rest of the park was plain grass , which had turned yellow ; it crackled underfoot . This day was going to be like the one before , windless and oppressive . The sky was cloudless but not clear : the air hung heavily , like invisible steam , so that the colours and outlines of objects in the distance were blurred . At the far side of the park was a sloping asphalt ramp , which I climbed . It led to a residential street lined with small , rather shabby houses set close together , the two - storey shoe - box kind with wooden trim round the windows and eaves . Some of the houses had freshlypainted trimmings , which merely accentuated the weatherbeaten 44 surfaces of the shingled fronts . The district was the sort that had been going downhill for some decades but had been pushed uphill again in the past few years . Several refugees from the suburbs had bought these city houses and completely refinished them , painting them a sophisticated white and adding flagstone walks and evergreens in cement planters and coachlamps by the doors . The redone houses looked flippant beside the others , as though they had chosen to turn their backs with an irresponsible light - heartedness upon the problems of time and shabbiness and puritan weather . I resolved to avoid the transformed houses when I began to interview . I would n't find the right sort of people there : they would be the martini set . There is something intimidating about a row of closed doors if you know you have to go up and knock on them and ask what amounts to a favour . I straightened my dress and my shoulders and assumed what I hoped was an official but friendly expression , and walked as far as the next block practising it before I had worked up resolution enough to begin . At the end of the block I could see what looked like a fairly new apartment - building . I made it my goal : it would be cool inside , and might supply me with any missing interviews . I rang the first doorbell . Someone scrutinized me briefly through the white semi - transparent curtains of the front window ; then the door was opened by a sharp - featured woman in a print apron with a bib . Her face had not a vestige of makeup on it , not even lipstick , and she was wearing those black shoes with laces and thick heels that make me think of the word "
16625	16639	15528	15528	they	226	" and that I associate with the bargain - basements of department stores . "
16648	16655	16643	16643	I	0	" I said , smiling falsely . "

16686	16697	16682	16682	You	0	" she asked , glancing at my papers and pencil . "
16728	16749	16755	16755	she	547	" I added lamely . I did n't think I was going to find what I was looking for . 45 "
16767	16776	16755	16755	she	547	" Well , actually it 's about beer , "
16835	16839	16816	16816	she	547	" Come in . "
16915	16920	16921	16921	he	2197	" Now young lady , "
16926	17000	16921	16921	he	2197	" I 'm not going to chastize you personally because I can see you are a nice girl and only the innocent means to this abominable end . But you will be so kind as to give these tracts to your employers . Who can tell but that their hearts may yet be softened ? The propagation of drink and of drunkenness to excess is an iniquity , a sin against the Lord . "
17019	17036	17014	17015	Seymour Surveys	1	" Our company does n't have anything to do with selling the beer , you know . "
17037	17044	17045	17045	he	2197	" It is the same thing , "
17049	17089	17045	17045	he	2197	" it is all the same thing , ' Those who are not with me are against me , saith the Lord . ' Do not try to whiten the sepulchres of those traffickers in human misery and degradation . "
17105	17152	17090	17090	He	2197	" You might read those yourself , young lady . Of course you never pollute your lips with alcohol , but no soul is utterly pure and proof against temptation . Perhaps the seed will not fall by the wayside , nor yet on stony ground . "

17989	17992	17982	17982	he	570	" Yes . "
18316	18325	18303	18303	I	0	" Hello there , is your father in ? "
18338	18345	18346	18346	he	591	" No . He 's dead , "
18349	18352	18346	18346	he	591	" Oh . "
18442	18449	18450	18450	I	0	" Are you really only fifteen ? "
18462	18469	18470	18470	he	591	" I 'm twenty - six , "
18637	18665	18632	18632	his	591	" Number six . That was seven to ten bottles per week , high enough to qualify him for the questionnaire , and I told him so . "
18670	18924	18632	18632	his	591	" he said . I felt a slight sensation of alarm as I stepped over the threshold and the door closed woodenly behind me . 49 We were in a living room of medium size , perfectly square , with a kitchenette opening off it on one side and the hallway to the bedrooms on the other . The slats of the Venetian blind on the one small window were closed , making the room dim as twilight . The walls , as far as I could tell in the semi - darkness , were a flat white ; there were no pictures on them . The floor was covered by a very good Persian carpet with an ornate design of maroon and green and purple scrolls and flowers , even better , I thought , than the one in the lady down below 's parlour which had been left her by her paternal grandfather . One wall had a bookcase running its whole length , the kind people make themselves out of boards and bricks . The only other pieces of furniture were three huge , ancient and overstuffed easy chairs , one red plush , one a worn greenishblue brocade , and one a faded purple , each with a floor - lamp beside it . All exposed surfaces of the room were littered with loose papers , notebooks , books opened face - down and other books bristling with pencils and torn slips of paper stuck in them as markers . "
18931	18943	18632	18632	his	591	" I asked . He fixed me with his lugubrious eyes . "
18950	18954	18947	18947	you	598	" he intoned , "
18960	18961	18947	18947	you	598	" "
18967	19026	18947	18947	you	598	" I said politely . I walked across the room , trying to preserve my air of cheerful briskness while picking my way unsteadily over and around the objects on the floor . I was heading towards the purple chair , which was the only one that did n't have a rat's - nest of papers in it . "
19033	19045	19027	19027	You	598	" he said behind me in a tone of slight admonishment , "
19062	19063	19052	19052	He	91	" "
19074	19075	19052	19052	He	91	" "
19078	19082	19089	19089	he	91	" he said , "
19123	19215	19109	19109	he	91	" I did n't see how by merely sitting on them I could possibly disorganize them any more , but I did n't say so . I was wondering whether Trevor and Fish were two imaginary playmates that this boy had made up , and also whether he had lied about his age . In this light his face could have been of 5o a ten - year - old . He stood gazing at me solemnly , shoulders hunched , arms folded across his torso , holding his own elbows . "
19226	19227	19219	19219	yours	598	" "
19230	19234	19219	19219	yours	598	" he said , "
19258	19287	19249	19249	I	0	" I wanted to go over and see exactly what he had got all arranged in it , but I reminded myself that I was there on business . "
19296	19297	19249	19249	I	0	" "
19301	19305	19249	19249	I	0	" he said , "
19314	19315	19249	19249	I	0	" "
19322	19383	19249	19249	I	0	" I said hurriedly . I made my way back across the expanse of paper and peered around the corner into the kitchenette . A peculiar odour greeted me - there seemed to be garbage bags in every corner , and the rest of the space was taken up by large pots and kettles , some clean , others not . "
19395	19424	19384	19384	I.	606	" I said . I stooped and began to skim the papers off the surface of the carpet , much as one would skim scum from a pond . "
19435	19439	19429	19429	you	606	" he said . "
19462	19657	19454	19454	We	608	" He slouched across to the hall and through an open doorway . Of necessity I followed him . The room was a white - walled oblong box , dark as the living room : the Venetian blind was down here too . It was bare of furniture except for an ironing - board with an iron on it , a chess set with a few scattered pieces in a corner of the room , a typewriter sitting on the floor , a cardboard carton which seemed to have dirty laundry in it and which he kicked into the closet as I came in , and a narrow bed . He pulled a grey army - blanket over the tangle of sheets on the bed and crawled onto it , where he settled himself crosslegged , backed into the corner formed by the two walls . He switched on the reading - lamp over the bed , took a cigarette from a pack which he replaced in his back pocket , lit it , and sat holding the cigarette before him , his hands cupped , like a starved buddha burning incense to itself . "
19661	19800	19454	19454	We	608	" he said . I sat down on the edge of the bed - there were no chairs - and began to go through the questionnaire with him . After I had asked 5i each question he would lean his head back against the wall , close his eyes , and give the answer ; then he would open his eyes again and watch me with barely - perceptible signs of concentration while I asked the next . When we got to the telephone commercial he went to the phone in the kitchen to dial the number . He stayed out there for what seemed to me a long time . I went to check , and found him listening with the receiver pressed to his ear and his mouth twisted in something that was almost a smile . "
19809	19822	19801	19801	You	610	" I said reproachfully . He put down the receiver with reluctance . "
19835	19853	19824	19824	I	0	" he asked in the diffident but wheedling voice of a small child begging an extra cookie . "
19856	19860	19824	19824	I	0	" I said , "
19868	19893	19824	19824	I	0	" I did n't want him blocking the line for the interviewers . We went back to the bedroom and resumed our respective postures . "
19928	19953	19917	19917	you	610	" I said . This was the free - association part of the questionnaire , meant to test immediate responses to certain key phrases . "
19966	19977	19914	19914	I	0	" He threw his head back and closed his eyes . "
19980	19986	19914	19914	I	0	" he said , considering . "
20000	20088	19917	19917	you	610	" An interviewer is always supposed to write down the exact words of the answer , so I did . I thought about slipping this interview into the stack of real ones , to vary the monotony for one of the women with the crayons - Mrs. Weemers , perhaps , or Mrs. Gundridge . She 'd read it out loud to the others , and they would remark that it took all kinds ; the topic would be good for at least three coffee - breaks . "
20098	20099	19917	19917	you	610	" "
20154	20162	20163	20163	I	0	" he said with his eyes open . "
20178	20184	20187	20187	they	615	" 5 * I said , "
20200	20208	20187	20187	they	615	" ' He meditated for several minutes . "
20213	20217	20187	20187	they	615	" he said . "
20227	20232	20187	20187	they	615	" His forehead wrinkled . "
20245	20254	20255	20255	I	0	" For the first time he seemed upset . "
20333	20342	20331	20331	Shakespeare	96	" he said in a less agitated voice , "
20370	20371	20363	20363	Shakespeare	96	" "
20375	20478	20373	20373	you	96	" I wrote busily . By this time I was convinced that he was a compulsive neurotic of some sort and that I 'd better remain calm and not display any fear . I was n't frightened exactly - he did n't look like the violent type - but these questions definitely made him tense . He might be tottering on an emotional brink , one of the phrases might be enough to push him over . Those people are like that I thought , remembering certain case histories Ainsley had told me ; little things like words can really bother them . "
20493	20501	20373	20373	you	96	" He contemplated that one at length . "
20510	20514	20558	20558	I	0	" he said , "
20561	20566	20558	20558	I	0	" he said sadly , "

20583	20608	20558	20558	I	0	" I said , thinking of what would happen to the i.b.m . machine if they ever tried to run this thing through it . "
20621	20622	20558	20558	I	0	" "
20625	20634	20558	20558	I	0	" he said , his voice approaching enthusiasm , "
20745	20746	20823	20823	you	622	" "
20749	20775	20823	20823	you	622	" I said , scribbling madly to get it all down . There was silence while we both listened to the scratching of my pencil . "
20817	20818	20819	20819	I	0	" "
20825	20833	20819	20819	I	0	" he said , losing interest completely . "
20852	20853	20819	20819	I	0	" "
20856	20862	20863	20863	you	622	" I protested , astonished , "
20882	20883	20863	20863	you	622	" "
20892	20898	20884	20884	You	622	" he said with patience , "

20954	20971	20938	20938	someone	2198	" I said severely . I had forgotten for the moment that it was n't real . "
20978	20989	20974	20974	you	622	" he said , smiling his half - smile again . "
21016	21118	21008	21008	I	0	" I had a twinge of irritation . I had been feeling compassion for him as a sufferer on the verge of mental collapse , and now he had revealed the whole thing as a self - conscious performance . I could either get up and leave at once , showing my displeasure , or admit that he was right . I frowned at him , trying to decide what to do ; but just then I heard the front door opening and the sound of voices . He jerked forward and listened tensely , then leaned back against the wall . "
21133	21137	21138	21141	the other two bores	636	" he said , "
21172	21197	21163	21170	a capital - G girl in the room	638	" There was a brown - paper crunkle of grocery - bags being set down in the kitchen , and a deep voice said , "
21206	21209	21163	21170	a capital - G girl in the room	638	" rt^Ar V\\^yvx0^ "
21218	21260	21163	21170	a capital - G girl in the room	638	" I said . If the others were at all like this one I did n't think I would be able to cope . I gathered my 54 questionnaires together and stood up , at the same time as the voice said "
21268	21282	21262	21262	Duncan	54	" and a furry bearded head appeared in the doorway . I gasped . "
21291	21292	21295	21295	I	0	" "
21337	21344	21335	21335	Fish	92	" he said to the beard , "
21349	21402	21347	21347	Goldilocks	99	" I smiled rigidly . I am not a blonde . Another head now appeared above the first : a white - skinned face with receding lightish hair , skyblue eyes , and an admirably - chiselled nose . His jaw dropped when he saw me . It was time to leave . "
21406	21419	21404	21404	you	54	" I said coolly but graciously to the one on the bed . "
21426	21450	21420	21420	You	54	" He actually grinned as I marched to the doorway and as the heads retreated in alarm to let me pass he called , "

21479	21512	21465	21468	only fat sloppy housewives	640	" I said with as much dignity as I could muster , and not intending to justify myself by explaining the high - well , higher - status of my real job , "
21533	23298	23299	23299	Marian	112	" When I was outside I looked at the questionnaire . The notes I had made of his answers were almost indecipherable in the glare of the sunlight ; all I could see on the page was a blur of grey scribbling . 7 Technically I was still one and a half interviews short , but I had enough for the necessary report and the questionnaire changes . Besides , I wanted to have a bath and change before going to Peter 's and the interviewing had taken longer than I expected . I got back to the apartment and threw the questionnaires on the bed . Then I looked around for Ainsley , but she was out . I gathered together my washcloth , soap , toothbrush and toothpaste , put on 55 i my dressing gown , and went downstairs . Our apartment has no bathroom of its own , which helps to account for the low rent . Perhaps the house was built before they had them , or perhaps it was felt that servants did n't need bathrooms ; at any rate , we have to use the second floor bathroom , which makes life difficult at times . Ainsley is always leaving rings , which the lady down below regards as a violation of her shrine . She leaves deodorants and % cleansers and brushes and sponges in conspicuous places , which has % u no effect on Ainsley but makes me feel uneasy . Sometimes I go ^ < downstairs after Ainsley has taken a bath and clean out the tub . I had wanted to soak for a while , but I had barely scrubbed away the afternoon 's film of dust and bus fumes when the lady > ^ down below began making rustling and throat - clearing noises ^ outside the door . This is herjway of suggesting that she wants to get in : she never knocks and asks . I clambered upstairs again , dressed , had a cup of tea , and set out for Peter 's . The ancestors watched me with their fading daguerrotyped eyes as I went down the stairs , their mouths bleak above their stiff collars . Usually we went out for dinner , but when we did n't the pattern was that I would walk over to Peter 's and get something to cook at a store on the way - one of those small grubby stores you sometimes find in the older residential districts . Of course he could have picked me up at the house in his Volkswagen , but he is made irritable by errands ; also I do n't like to give the lady down below too much food for speculation . I did n't know whether we were going out for dinner or not - Peter had said nothing about it - so I dropped in at the store just to be on the safe side . He would probably have a hangover from the celebration of the night before and would n't feel like a full - scale dinner . Peter 's apartment - building is just far enough away to make getting there by transportation - system more bother than it 's worth . It 's south of our district and east of the university , in a rundown area , nearly a slum , that is scheduled to be transformed over the next few years by high - rise apartments . Several have been completed but Peter 's is still under construction . Peter is the only person who lives there ; he does so temporarily , at only a third of the price they 'll charge when the building is finished . He was able to 56 make this deal through a connection he acquired during a piece of contract manipulating . Peter 's in his articling year as a lawyer and does n't have extravagant amounts of money yet - for instance he could n't have afforded the apartment at its list price - but his is a small firm and he 's rising in it like a balloon . All summer whenever I went to the apartment I had to thread my way through piles of concrete blocks near the entrance to the lobby , around shapes covered with dusty tarpaulins on the floor inside , and sometimes over troughs for plaster and ladders and stacks of pipes on the stairway going up ; the elevators are n't in working order yet . Occasionally I would be stopped by workmen who did n't know about Peter and who would insist that I could n't go in because nobody lived there . We would then have arguments about the existence or non - existence of Mr. Wollander , and once I 'd had to take some of them up to the seventh floor with me and produce Peter in the flesh . I knew there would n't be any men working as late as five on Saturday though ; and they probably had the whole long weekend off anyway . Generally they seem to go about things in a leisurely manner , which suits Peter . There 's been a strike or a layoff too which has held things up . Peter hopes it will go on : the longer they take , the longer his rent will be low . Structurally the building was complete , except for the finishing touches . They had all the windows in and had scrawled them with white soap hieroglyphics to keep people from walking through them . The glass doors had been installed several weeks before , and Peter had got an extra set of keys made for me : a necessity rather than just a convenience , since the buzzer - system for letting people in had not yet been connected . Inside , the shiny surfaces - tiled floors , painted walls , mirrors , light - fixtures - which would later give the building its expensive gloss , its beetle - hard internal shell , had not yet begun to secrete themselves . The rough grey underskin of subflooring and unplastered wall - surface was still showing , and raw wires dangled like loose nerves from most of the sockets . I went up the stairs carefully , avoiding the dirty bannister , thinking how much I had come to associate weekends with this new - building smell of sawn boards and cement - dust . On the floors I passed , the doorways of the future apartments gaped emptily , their doors as 57 yet unhung . It was a long climb up ; as I reached Peter 's floor I was breathing hard . I would be glad when the elevators were running . Peter 's apartment , of course , has been largely finished ; he 'd never live in a place without proper floors and electricity , no matter how low the rent . His connection uses it as a model of what the rest of the apartments will be like , and shows it to the occasional prospective tenant , always phoning Peter before he arrives . It does n't inconvenience Peter much : he 's out a lot and does n't mind people looking through his place . I opened the door , went in , and took the groceries to the refrigerator in the kitchenette . I could tell by the sound of running water that Peter was taking a shower : he often is . I strolled into the living room and looked out of the window . The apartment is n't far enough up for a good view of the lake or the city - you can only see a mosaic of dingy little streets and narrow backyards , and you are n't low enough to see clearly what the people are doing in them . Peter has n't put much in the living room yet . He 's got a Danishmodern sofa and a chair to match and a hi - fi set , but nothing else . He says he 'd rather wait and get good things than clutter the place up with cheap things he does n't like . I suppose he is right , but still it will help when he gets more : his two pieces of furniture are made to look very spindly and isolated by the large empty space that surrounds them . I get restless when I 'm waiting for anyone , I tend to pace . I wandered into the bedroom and looked out the window there , though it 's much the same view . Peter has the bedroom nearly done , he 's told me , though for some tastes it might be slightly sparse . He has a good - sized sheepskin on the floor and a plain , solid bed , also good sized , second - hand but in perfect condition , which is always neatly made . Then an austere square desk , dark wood , and one of those leather - cushioned office swivel - chairs that he picked up second - hand too ; he says it 's very comfortable for working . The desk has a reading lamp on it , a blotter , an assortment of pens and pencils , and Peter 's graduation portrait in a stand - up frame . On the wall above there 's a small bookcase - his law books on the bottom shelf , his hoard of paperback detective novels on the top shelf , and miscellaneous books and magazines 58 in between . To one side of the bookcase is a pegboard with hooks that holds Peter 's collection of weapons : two rifles , a pistol , and several wicked - looking knives . I 've been told all the names , but I can never remember them . I 've never seen Peter use any of them , though of course in the city he would n't have many opportunities . Apparently he used to go hunting a lot with his oldest friends . Peter 's cameras hang there too , their glass eyes covered by leather cases . There 's a full - length mirror on the outside of the cupboard door , and inside the cupboard are all of Peter 's clothes . Peter must have heard me prowling . He called from inside the bathroom , "
23304	23305	23302	23302	you	112	" "
23310	23315	23306	23306	I	0	" I called back . "
23318	23319	23306	23306	I	0	" "
23347	23453	23339	23339	I	0	" I knew where everything was . Peter has a cupboard shelf wellstocked with liquor , and he never forgets to re - fill the ice - cube trays . I went to the kitchen , and carefully assembled the drinks , remembering not to leave out the twist of lemon - peel Peter likes . It takes me longer than average to make drinks : I have to measure . I heard the shower stop and the sound of feet , and when I turned around Peter was standing in the kitchen doorway , dripping wet , wearing a tasteful navy - blue towel . "
23456	23460	23339	23339	I	0	" I said . "
23468	23506	23339	23339	I	0	" He stepped forward silently , took my glass from my hand , swallowed a third of its contents and set it on the table behind me . Then he put both of his arms round me . "
23514	23559	23507	23507	You	112	" I said softly . I put my hand , cold from holding the icy glass , on the small of his back , but he did n't flinch . His flesh was warm and resilient after the shower . He kissed my ear . "
23565	23957	23507	23507	You	112	" he said . I gazed up at Peter 's shower - curtain , a silver plastic ground covered with curve - necked swans in pink swimming in groups of three among albino lily - pads ; it was n't Peter 's taste at all , he 'd bought it in a hurry because the water kept running over the floor when he showered , he had n't had time to look properly and this one had been the least garish . I was wondering why he had insisted 59 that we get into the bathtub . I had n't thought it was a good idea , I much prefer the bed and I knew the tub would be too small and uncomfortably hard and ridgey , but I had n't objected : I felt I should be sympathetic because of Trigger . However I had taken the bath mat in with me , which softened the ridges . I had expected Peter to be depressed , but though he was n't his usual self he certainly was n't depressed . I could n't quite figure out the bath tub . I thought back to the other two unfortunate marriages . After the first , it had been the sheepskin on his bedroom floor , and after the second a scratchy blanket in a field we 'd driven four hours to get to , and where I was made uneasy by thoughts of farmers and cows . I supposed this was part of the same pattern , whatever the pattern was . Perhaps an attempt to assert youthfulness and spontaneity , a revolt against the stale doom of stockings in the sink and bacon fat congealed in pans evoked for him by his friends ' marriages . Peter 's abstraction on these occasions gave me the feeling that he liked ^oing them because he had read about them somewhere , but I could never locate the quotations . The field was , I guessed , a hunting story from one of the outdoorsy male magazines ; I remembered he had worn a plaid jacket . The sheepskin I placed in one of the men 's glossies , the kind with lust in pent - houses . But the bathtub ? Possibly one of the murder mysteries he read as what he called "
23960	24139	23339	23339	I	0	" ; but would n't that rather be someone drowned in the bathtub ? A woman . That would give them a perfect bit to illustrate on the cover : a completely naked woman with a thin covering of water and maybe a bar of soap or a rubber duck or a blood - stain to get her past the censors , floating with her hair spread out on the water , the cold purity of the bathtub surrounding her body , chaste as ice only because dead , her open eyes staring up into those of the reader . The bathtub as a coffin . I had a fleeting vision : what if we both fell asleep and the tap got turned on accidentally , lukewarm so we would n't notice , and the water slowly rose and killed us ? That would be a surprise for the connection when he came to show his next batch of apartment - renters around : water all over the floor and two naked corpses clasped in a last embrace . "
24142	24148	23339	23339	I	0	" they 'd all say . "
24153	24343	23339	23339	I	0	" And on summer nights our ghosts would be seen gliding along the halls of the 60 Brentview Apartments , Bachelor , Two - Bedroom and Luxury , clad only in bath towels I shifted my head , tired of the swans , and looked instead at the curving silver nozzle of the shower . I could smell Peter 's hair , a clean soap smell . He smelled of soap all the time , not only when he had recently taken a shower . It was a smell I associated with dentists ' chairs and medicine , but on him I found it attractive . He never wore sickly - sweet shaving lotion or the other male substitutes for perfume . I could see his arm where it lay across me , the hairs arranged in rows . The arm was like the bathroom : clean and white and new , the skin unusually smooth for a man 's . I could n't see his face , which was resting against my shoulder , but I tried to visualize it . He was , as Clara had said , "
24347	24533	25313	25313	I	0	" ; that was probably what.had first attracted me to him . People noticed him , not because he had forceful or peculiar features , but because lie was ordinariness raised to perfection , like the youngish well - groomed faces of cigarette ads . But sometimes I wanted a reassuring wart or mole , or patch of roughness , something the touch could fix on instead of gliding over . We had met at a garden party following my graduation ; he was a friend of a friend , and we had eaten ice - cream in the shade together . He had been quite formal and had asked me what I planned to do . I had talked about a career , making it sound much less vague than it was in my own mind , and he told me later that it was my aura of independence and common sense he had liked : he saw me as the kind of girl who would n't try to take over his life . He had recently had an unpleasant experience with what he called "
24537	24713	25313	25313	I	0	" . That was the assumption we had been working on , and it had suited me . We had been taking each other at our face values , which meant we had got on very well , pf course I had to adjust to his moods , but that 's true of any man , and his were too obvious to cause much difficulty . Over the summer he had become a pleasant habit , and as we had been seeing each other only on weekends the veneer had n't had a chance to wear off . However the first time I had gone to his apartment had almost been the last . He had plied me with hi - fi music and brandy , thinking 61 he was crafty and suave , and I had allowed myself to be manipulated into the bedroom . We had set our brandy snifters down on the desk , when Peter , being acrobatic , had knocked one of the glasses to the floor where it smashed . "
24720	24827	25313	25313	I	0	" I said , perhaps undiplomatically ; but Peter had turned on the light , gone for the broom and dustpan , and swept up all the bits of glass , picking the larger ones up carefully and accurately like a pigeon pecking crumbs . The mood had been shattered . We had said goodnight soon afterwards , rather snappishly , and I had n't heard from him after that for over a week . Of course things were much better now . Peter stretched and yawned beside me , grinding my arm against the porcelain . I winced and withdrew it gently from beneath him . "
24834	24851	25313	25313	I	0	" he asked casually , his mouth against my shoulder . He always asked me that . "
24854	24871	25313	25313	I	0	" I murmured ; why could n't he tell ? One of these days I should say "
24874	25137	25138	25138	I	0	" just to see what he would do ; but I knew in advance he would n't believe me . I reached up and stroked his damp hair , scratching the back of his neck ; he liked that , in moderation . Maybe he had intended the bathtub as an expression of his personality . I tried thinking of ways to make that fit . Asceticism ? A modern version of hair shirts or sitting on spikes ? Mortification of the flesh ? But surely nothing about Peter suggested that ; he liked his comforts , and besides it was n't his flesh that was being mortified : he had been on top . Or maybe it had been a reckless young - man gesture , like jumping into the swimming pool with your clothes on , or putting things on your head at parties . But this image did n't suit Peter either . I was glad there were no more of his group of old friends left to be married : next time he might have tried cramming us into a clothes closet , or an exotic posture in the kitchen sink . Or maybe - and the thought was chilling - he had intended it as an expression of my personality . A new corridor of possibilities extended itself before me : did he really think of me as a lavatory fixture . What kind of a girl did he think I was ? He was twining his fingers in the hair at the nape of my neck . "
25149	25312	25138	25138	I	0	" he whispered . He bit my shoulder , and I recognized this as a signal for irresponsible gaiety : Peter does n't usually bite . I bit his shoulder in return , then , making sure the shower lever was still up , I reached out my right foot - I have agile feet - and turned on the cold tap . 8 By eight - thirty we were on our way to meet Len . Peter 's mood , whatever it had been , had changed to one which I had n't yet interpreted , so I did n't attempt conversation as we drove along . Peter kept his eyes on the road , turning corners too quickly and muttering under his breath at the other drivers . He had n't fastened his seat belt . He had not been pleased at first when I told him about the arrangements I 'd made with Len , even when I said , "
25321	25322	25316	25316	you	646	" "
25327	25351	25325	25325	he	646	" he had asked suspiciously . If it was n't Peter I would have suspected jealousy . Peter is n't the jealous type . "
25358	25362	25354	25356	an old friend	647	" I said , "
25385	25424	25376	25376	he	646	" I knew Len was n't that high on the scale , but Peter is impressed by people 's jobs . Since I had intended Len as a distraction for Peter I wanted the evening to be pleasant . "
25427	25431	25376	25376	he	646	" said Peter , "
25443	25480	25432	25438	one of those arts - crafts types	649	" We were sitting at the kitchen table , eating frozen peas and smoked meat , the kind you boil for three minutes in the plastic packages . Peter had decided against going out for dinner . "
25484	25493	25432	25438	one of those arts - crafts types	649	" I said , eager to defend Len , "
25498	25505	25432	25438	one of those arts - crafts types	649	" Peter pushed his plate away . "
25514	25590	25509	25509	you	650	" he said petulantly . I was hurt : I considered this unfair . I like to cook , but I had been deliberately refraining at Peter 's for fear he would feel threatened . t.b.w.—5 63 Besides , he had always liked smoked meat before , and it was perfectly nourishing . I was about to make a sharp comment , but repressed it . Peter after all was suffering . Instead I asked , "
25596	25654	25655	25655	God	78	" Peter groaned , leaned back in his chair , lit a cigarette , and gazed inscrutably at the far wall . Then he got up and poured himself another gin - and - tonic . He tried pacing up and down in the kitchen , but it was too narrow , so he sat down again . "
25657	25661	25663	25663	Trigger	77	" he said , "
25680	25865	25671	25671	he	651	" He continued in a disjointed monologue in which Trigger was made to sound like the last of the Mohicans , noble and free , the last of the dinosaurs , destroyed by fate and lesser species , and the last of the dodos , too dumb to get away . Then he attacked the bride , accusing her of being predatory and malicious and of sucking poor Trigger into the domestic void ( making me picture her as a vacuum - cleaner ) , and finally ground to a halt with several funereal predictions about his own solitary future . By solitary he meant without other single men . I swallowed the last of my frozen peas . I had heard this speech twice before , or something like it , and I knew there was nothing I could say . If I agreed with him it would only intensify his depression , and if I disagreed he would suspect me of siding with the bride . The first time I had been cheerful and maxim - like , and had attempted consolation . "
25873	25878	25671	25671	he	651	" I had said , "
25915	25916	25910	25910	he	653	" "
25923	25990	25917	25917	I	0	" Peter had said moodily . So this time I said nothing , remarking to myself that it was a good thing Peter had got this speech over with early in the evening . I got up and dished him out some ice - cream , which he took as a sympathetic gesture , putting his arm round my waist and giving me a gloomy hug . "
25995	25999	25993	25993	Marian	112	" he said , "
26025	26289	26020	26020	you	112	" I leaned against him , stroking his hair while he ate his ice - cream . We left the car in one of the usual places , on a side - street behind the Park Plaza . As we started to walk along I put my hand through 64 Peter 's arm and he smiled down at me abstractedly . I smiled back at him -1 was glad he was out of the teeth - gritting mood he had been in while driving - and he brought his other hand over and placed it on top of mine . I was going to bring my other hand up and place it on top of his , but I thought if I did then mine would be on top and he 'd have to take his arm out from underneath so he 'd have another hand to put on top of the heap , like those games at recess . I squeezed his arm affectionately instead . We reached the Park Plaza and Peter opened the plate glass door for me as he always does . Peter is scrupulous about things like that ; he opens car doors too . Sometimes I expect him to click his heels . While we waited for the elevator I watched our double image in the floor - to - ceiling mirror by the elevator doors . Peter was wearing one of his more subdued costumes , a brownish - green summer suit whose cut emphasized the functional spareness of his body . All his accessories matched . "
26299	26337	26293	26293	Len	87	" I said to him , keeping an eye on myself and talking to him in the mirror . I was thinking I was just about the right height for him . The elevator came and Peter said "
26342	26578	26579	26579	Marian	112	" to the whitegloved elevator girl , and we moved smoothly upwards . The Park Plaza is a hotel really , but they have a bar at the top , one of Peter 's favourite places for a quiet drink , which was why I had suggested it to Len . Being up that high gives you a sense of the vertical which is rare in the city . The room itself is well - lit , not dark as a drain like many others , and it 's clean . No one ever seems to get offensively drunk there , and you can hear yourself talk : there 's no band or singer . The chairs are comfortable , the decor is reminiscent of the eighteenth century , and the bartenders all know Peter . Ainsley told me once that she had been there when someone threatened to commit suicide by jumping off the wall of the patio outside , but it may have been one of her stories . We walked in ; there were n't many people , so I immediately spotted Len , sitting at one of the black - topped tables . We went over and I introduced Peter to him ; they shook hands , Peter abruptly , Len affably . The waiter appeared promptly at our table and Peter order two more gin - and - tonics . 65 "
26588	26635	26586	26586	you	112	" Len said , leaning across the corner of the table to kiss my cheek ; a habit , I reflected , he must have picked up in England , as he never used to do it . He had put on a little weight . , "
26641	26662	26666	26666	I	0	" I asked him . I wanted him to talk V and entertain Peter , who was looking grumpy . \ "
26717	26726	26711	26711	I	0	" he said , tattling to Peter , ^g "
26798	26816	26817	26817	Marian	112	" He smiled , showing his brilliantly - polished white A teeth . ^ Peter brightened perceptibly . "
26825	26829	26817	26817	Marian	112	" he said . "
26832	26846	26817	26817	Marian	112	" Len said , examining the squarish nails of his disproportionately large hands ; "
26916	26975	26982	26982	You	52	" Peter relaxed ; anyone interested in news reports , he was probably thinking , could n't be queer . I felt a hand touch my shoulder , and looked around . A young girl I 'd never seen before was standing there . I opened my mouth to ask her what she wanted , when Peter said , "
26992	27001	26982	26982	You	52	" I looked again : it was Ainsley . "
27006	27016	27017	27017	you	112	" she said in a breathless semi - whisper , "
27040	27095	27030	27030	they	663	" Len and Peter had risen . I introduced Ainsley to Len , much against my better judgement , and she sat down in the fourth chair . 66 Peter 's face had a puzzled expression . He had met Ainsley before and had n't liked her , suspecting her of holding what he called "
27100	27131	27017	27017	you	112	" views because she had favoured him with a theoretical speech about liberating the Id. Politically Peter is conservative . She had offended him too by calling one of his opinions "
27133	27144	27030	27030	they	663	" , and he had retaliated by calling one of hers "
27146	27199	27017	27017	you	112	" . Right now , I guessed , he could tell she was up to something but was unwilling to rock her boat until he knew what it was . He required evidence . The waiter appeared and Len asked Ainsley what she would have . She hesitated , then said timidly , "
27214	27220	27221	27221	I	0	" Len beamed at her . "
27233	27237	27231	27231	Marian	112	" he said , "
27249	27250	27239	27239	you	0	" "
27261	27266	27251	27251	I	0	" I said sourly , "
27273	27620	27251	27251	I	0	" I was furious with Ainsley . She had put me in a very awkward position . I could either give the game away by revealing she had been to college and was in fact several months older than me , or I could keep silent and participate in what amounted to a fraud . I knew perfectly well why she had come : Len was a potential candidate , and she had chosen to inspect him this way because she had sensed she 'd have difficulty forcing me to introduce them otherwise . The waiter returned with her gingerale . I was amazed that he had n't asked for her birth - certificate , but upon reflection I decided that any experienced waiter would assume that no girl who seemed so young would dare to walk into a bar dressed like that and order gingerale unless she was in reality safely over - age . It 's the adolescents who overdress that they suspect , and Ainsley was not overdressed . She had dug out from somewhere a cotton summer creation I 'd never seen before , a pink and light - blue gingham check on white with a ruffie around the neck . Her hair was tied behind her head with a pink bow and on one of her wrists she had a tinkly silver charm - bracelet . Her makeup was understated , her eyes carefully but not noticeably shadowed to make them twice as large and round and blue , and she had sacrificed her long oval fingernails , biting them nearly to the quick so that they had a 67 jagged schoolgirlish quality . I could see she was determined . Len was talking to her , asking her questions , trying to draw her out . She sipped at her gingerale , giving short , shy answers . She was evidently afraid of saying too much , aware of Peter as a threat . When Len asked her what she did , however , she could give a truthful answer . "
27629	27647	27621	27621	I	0	" she said , and blushed a warm and genuine - looking pink . I almost choked . "
27651	27655	27649	27649	me	0	" I said , "
27670	27854	27656	27656	I	0	" Actually I wanted to decide what I should do - surely it was unethical of me to let Len be deceived - and Ainsley must have sensed this , for she gave me a quick warning look as I got up . Outside , I leaned my arms against the top of the wall , which came almost to my collarbone , and gazed out over the city . A moving line of lights ran straight in front of me till it hit and broke against and flowed around a blob of darkness , the park ; and another line went at right - angles , disappearing on both sides into the distance . What could I do ? Was it any of my business ? I knew that if I interfered I would be breaking an unspoken code , and that Ainsley was sure to get back at me some way through Peter . She was clever at such things . Far off on the eastern horizon I saw a nicker of lightning . We were going to have a storm . "
27857	27863	27656	27656	I	0	" I said out loud , "
27870	28106	27656	27656	I	0	" If I was n't going to take deliberate steps , I 'd have to be sure of my self - control so I would n't say something by accident . I paced the terrace a couple of times till I felt I was ready to go back in , noting with a faint surprise that I was wobbling slightly . The waiter must have been around again : there was a fresh gin - and - tonic in my place . Peter was deep in a conversation with Len and scarcely acknowledged my return . Ainsley sat silent , her eyes lowered , jiggling her icecube around in her gingerale glass . I studied her latest version of herself , thinking that it was like one of the large plump dolls in the stores at Christmas - time , with washable rubber - smooth skin and glassy eyes and gleaming artificial hair . Pink and white . I attuned myself to Peter 's voice ; it sounded as though it was 68 coming from a distance . He was telling Len a story , which seemed to be about hunting . I knew Peter used to go hunting , especially with his group of old friends , but he had never told me much about it . He had said once that they never killed anything but crows , groundhogs and other small vermin . "
28246	28304	28312	28312	Trigger	77	" He paused to laugh . Len bared his teeth . The quality of Peter 's voice had changed ; it was a voice I did n't recognize . The sign saying temperance flashed in my mind : I could n't let my perceptions about Peter be distorted by the effects of alcohol , I warned myself . "
28351	28779	28342	28342	you	0	" and they were off on a discussion of Japanese lenses . Peter 's voice seemed to be getting louder and faster - the stream of words was impossible to follow , and my mind withdrew , concentrating instead on the picture of the scene in the forest . I saw it as though it was a slide projected on a screen in a dark room , the colours luminous , green , brown , blue for the sky , red . Peter stood with his back to me in a plaid shirt , his rifle slung on his shoulder . A group of friends , those friends whom I had never met , were gathered around him , their faces clearly visible in the sunlight that fell in shafts down through the anonymous trees , splashed with blood , the mouths wrenched with laughter . I could n't see the rabbit . I leaned forward , my arms on the black table - top . I wanted Peter to turn and talk to me , I wanted to hear his normal voice , but he would n't ; I studied the reflections of the other three as they 69 lay and moved beneath the polished black surface as in a pool of water ; they were all chin and no eyes , except for Ainsley 's eyes , their gaze resting gently on her glass . After a while I noticed with mild curiosity that a large drop of something wet had materialized on the table near my hand . I poked it with my finger and smudged it around a little before I realized with horror that it was a tear . I must be crying then ! Something inside me started to dash about in dithering mazes of panic , as though I had swallowed a tadpole . I was going to break down and make a scene , and I could n't . I slid out of my chair , trying to be as inconspicuous as possible , walked across the room avoiding the other tables with great care , and went out to the Ladies ' Powder Room . Checking first to make sure no one else was in there - I could n't have witnesses - I locked myself into one of the plushy - pink cubicles and wept for several minutes . I could n't understand what was happening , why I was doing this ; I had never done anything like it before and it seemed to me absurd . "
28786	28790	28342	28342	you	0	" I whispered . "
28799	28860	28861	28861	Marian	112	" The roll of toilet paper crouched in there with me , helpless and white and furry , waiting passively for the end . I tore some of it off and blew my nose . Some shoes appeared . I watched them carefully from under the door of my cell . They were , I decided , Ainsley 's shoes . "
28863	28867	28861	28861	Marian	112	" she called . "
28873	28874	28861	28861	Marian	112	" "
28877	28889	28861	28861	Marian	112	" I said . I wiped my eyes and came out . "
28892	28901	28903	28903	your	673	" I said , trying to sound controlled , "
28907	28908	28903	28903	your	673	" "
28913	28918	28903	28903	your	673	" she said coolly . "
28937	28938	28931	28931	you	112	" "
28943	28947	28939	28939	I	0	" I said , "
28970	28971	28972	28972	I	0	" "
28982	28986	28972	28972	I	0	" she protested . "
28992	29004	28972	28972	I	0	" She took off her pink bow and combed her hair . "
29020	29021	29012	29012	you	112	" "
29024	29028	29029	29029	You	112	" I said . "
29044	29353	28972	28972	I	0	" By now I was perfectly under control . We walked back to our chairs . Peter was talking at full speed to Len about the different methods of taking self - portraits : with 7o reflecting images in mirrors , self - timers that let you press the shutterrelease and then run to position and pose , and long cable - releases with triggers and air - type releases with bulbs . Len was contributing some information about the correct focussing of the image , but several minutes after I had sat down he gave me a quick peculiar look , as though he was disappointed with me . Then he switched back to the conversation . What had he meant ? I glanced from one to the other . Peter smiled at me in the middle of one of his sentences , fondly but from a distance , and then I thought I knew . He was treating me as a stage - prop ; silent but solid , a two - dimensional outline . He was n't ignoring me , as perhaps I had felt ( did that account for the ridiculous flight ? ) - he was depending on me ! And Len had looked at me that way because he thought I was being self - effacing on purpose , and that if so the relationship was more serious than I had said it was . Len never wished matrimony on anyone , especially anyone he liked . But he did n't know the situation ; he had misinterpreted . Suddenly the panic swept back over me . I gripped the edge of the table . The square elegant room with its looped curtains and muted carpet and crystal chandeliers was concealing things ; the murmuring air was filled with a soft menace . "
29357	29362	28972	28972	I	0	" I told myself . "
29367	29396	28972	28972	I	0	" I eyed the doors and windows , calculating distances . I had to get out . The lights flicked off and on and one of the waiters called "
29401	29423	29399	29399	gentlemen	676	" There was a pushing back of chairs . We descended in the elevator . Len said as we stepped off , "
29452	29456	29443	29443	You	677	" and Peter said "
29462	29583	29584	29584	Marian	112	" We went out through the glass doors . I took Peter 's arm and we walked on ahead . Ainsley had cut Len out from the herd and was allowing him to keep her safely behind . On the street the air was cooler ; there was a slight breeze . I let go of Peter 's arm and began to run . T.E.W.—-J * 71 I was tunning along the sidewalk . After the first minute I was surprised to find my feet moving , wondering how they had begun , but I did n't stop . The rest of them were so astonished they did n't do anything at all for a moment . Then Peter yelled , "
29596	29654	29590	29590	you	112	" I could hear the fury in his voice : this was the unforgivable sin , because it was public . I did n't answer , but I looked back over my shoulder as I ran . Both Peter and Len had started to run after me . Then they both stopped and I heard Peter call , "
29677	29902	29666	29666	you	112	" and he turned around and sprinted off in the other direction . This disturbed me - I must have been expecting Peter to chase me , but instead it was Len who was galloping heavily along behind me . I turned my head to the front just in time to avoid collision with an old man who was shambling out of a restaurant , then glanced back again . Ainsley had hesitated , not knowing which of them to follow , but now she was bouncing off in the direction Peter had taken . I saw her wobble in a flounce of pink and white around the corner . I was out of breath already , but I had a good head start on them . I could afford to slow down . Each lamp post as I passed it became a distance - marker on my course : it seemed an achievement , and accomplishment of some kind to put them one by one behind me . Since it was bar - closing time there were quite a few people on the street . I grinned at them and waved at some as I went by , almost laughing at the surprise on their faces . I was filled with the exhilaration of speed ; it was like a game of tag . "
29909	30524	29905	29905	Marian	112	" Len called behind me at intervals . Then Peter 's car turned the corner in front of me on to the main street . He must have driven around the block . That 's all right , I 7 * thought , he 's got to go across to the other lane , he wo n't be able to reach me . The car was on the far side of the road , coming towards me ; but there was a gap in the line of traffic , and it spurted forward and swivelled into a reckless U - turn . It was parallel to me now , slowing down . I could see Ainsley 's round expressionless face peering at me through the back window like a moon . All at once it was no longer a game . The blunt tank - shape was threatening . It was threatening that Peter had not given chase on foot but had enclosed himself in the armour of the car ; though of course that was the logical thing to do . In a minute the car would stop , the door would swing open ... where was there to go ? By this time I had passed the stores and restaurants and had come to a stretch of large old houses set well back from the street , most of which , I knew , were no longer lived in but had been converted into dentists ' offices and dress - making establishments . There was an open wrought - iron gateway . I plunged through it and ran up the gravel drive . It must have been some sort of private club . The front door of the house had an awning over it , and the windows were lit up . As I hesitated , hearing Len 's footsteps pounding nearer along the sidewalk , the front door started to open . I could n't be caught there ; I knew it was private property . I leapt the small hedge by the side of the driveway and skittered diagonally across the lawn into the shadows . I visualized Len pelting up the driveway and colliding with the outraged forces of society , which I pictured as a group of middle - aged ladies in evening dress , and was momentarily conscience - stricken . He was my friend . But he had taken sides against me and would have to pay the price . In the darkness at the side of the house I paused to consider . Behind me was Len ; on one side was the house , and on the other two sides I could see something that was more solid than the darkness , blocking my way . It was the brick wall attached to the iron gate at the front ; it seemed to go all the way around the house . I would have to climb it . I pushed my way through a mass of prickly shrubberies . The wall 73 was only shoulder high ; I took off my shoes and threw them over , then scrambled up , using branches and the uneven bricking of the wall as toe - holds . Something ripped . The blood was throbbing in my ears . I closed my eyes , knelt for a moment on the top of the wall , swaying dizzily , and dropped backwards . I felt myself caught , set down and shaken . It was Peter , who must have stalked me and waited there on the side - street , knowing I would come over the wall . "
30532	30555	29905	29905	Marian	112	" he said , his voice stern . His face in the light of the streetlamps was partly angry , partly alarmed . "
30561	30607	30608	30608	I	0	" I leaned against him and put my hand up to touch his neck . The relief of being stopped and held , of hearing Peter 's normal voice again and knowing he was real , was so great I started to laugh helplessly . ^ "
30612	30616	30608	30608	I	0	" I said , "
30634	30636	30608	30608	I	0	" % "
30643	30688	30690	30690	her	681	" Peter said , holding them out to me . He was annoyed but he was n't going to make a fuss . ^ Len heaved himself over the wall and landed on the earth with a s^ thunk . He was breathing heavily . "
30711	30751	30706	30707	the police	683	" ^ J The car was right there . Peter opened the front door for me and I ^ C su^ in ; Len got into the back seat with Ainsley . All he said to me v^ was , "
30761	31666	30755	30755	you	680	" Ainsley said nothing . We pulled away from the curb and rounded the corner , Len giving directions . I would rather have gone home , but I did n't want to cause Peter any more trouble that night . I sat up straight and folded my hands in my lap . We parked beside Len 's apartment building , which as far as I could tell at night was of the collapsing brown - brick ramshackle variety , with fire - escapes down the outside . There was no elevator , just creaky stairs with dark wooden railings . We ascended in decorous couples . The apartment itself was tiny , only one main room with a bathroom opening to one side and a kitchen to the other . It was somewhat disarranged , with suitcases on the floor and books and clothes v ty 74 strewn about : Lea evidently had n't finished moving into it yet . The bed was immediately to the left of the door , doubling as a chesterfield , and I kicked off my shoes and subsided onto it . My muscles had caught up with me and were beginning to ache with fatigue . Len poured the three of us generous shots of cognac , rummaged in the kitchen and managed to find some coke for Ainsley , and put on a record . Then he and Peter began to fiddle with a couple of cameras , screwing various lenses onto them and peering through them and exchanging information about exposure times . I felt deflated . I was filled with penitence , but there was no outlet for it . If I could be alone with Peter it would be different , I thought : he could forgive me . Ainsley was no help . I saw she was going to keep up her littlegirls - should - be - seen - and - not - heard act , as the safest course to follow . She had settled into a round wicker basket - chair , like the one in Clara 's back yard except that this one had a quilted corduroy cover in egg - yolk yellow . I 'd experienced those covers before . They 're kept on by elastic , and they have a habit of slipping off the edges of the chair if you wiggle around too much and closing up around you . Ainsley sat quite still though , holding her coca cola glass in her lap and contemplating her own reflection on the brown surface inside it . She registered neither pleasure nor boredom ; her inert patience was that of & 4*jjtdae^plantin a swamp with its hollow bulbous leaves half - filled with water , waiting for some insect to be attracted , drowned , and digested . I was leaning back against the wall , sipping at my cognac , the noise of voices and music slapping against me like waves . I suppose the pressure of my body had pushed the bed out a little ; at any rate , without thinking much about anything I turned my head away from the room and looked down . I began to find something very attractive about the dark cool space between the bed and the wall . It would be quiet down there , I thought ; and less humid . I set my glass down on the telephone - table beside the bed and glanced quickly around the room . They were all engrossed : no one would notice . A minute later I was wedged sideways between the bed and the wall , out of sight but not at all comfortable . This will never do , I 75 thought ; I 'll have to go right underneath . It will be like a tent . It did n't occur to me to scramble back up . I eased the bed out from the wall as noiselessly as I could , using my whole body as a lever , lifted the fringed border of the bedspread , and slid myself in like a letter through a slot . It was a tight fit : the slats were unusually low for a bed , and I was forced to lie absolutely flat against the floor . I inched the bed back flush with the wall . It was quite cramped . Also , there were large rolls and clusters of dust strewn thickly over the floor like chunks of mouldy bread ( I thought indignantly , What a pig Len is ! Does n't sweep under his bed , then re - considered : he had n't been living there long and some of the dust may have been left over from whoever lived there before ) . But the semi - darkness , tinted orange by the filter of the bedspread that curtained me on all four sides , and the coolness and the solitude were pleasant . The raucous music and staccato laughter and the droning voices reached me muffled by the mattress . In spite of the narrowness and dust I was glad I did n't have to sit up there in the reverberating hot glare of the room . Though I was only two or three feet lower than the rest of them , I was thinking of the room as "
31669	31700	31705	31705	Marian	112	" . I myself was underground , I had dug myself a private burrow . I felt smug . One male voice , Peter 's I think , said loudly , "
31706	31714	31705	31705	Marian	112	" ? and the other one answered , "
31722	31994	31705	31705	Marian	112	" I smiled to myself . It was satisfying to be the only one who knew where I really was . The position , however , was becoming more and more of a strain . The muscles in my neck were hurting ; I wanted to stretch ; I was going to sneeze . I began to wish they would hurry up and realize I had disappeared , so they could search for me . I could no longer recall what good reasons had led me to cram myself under Len 's bed in the first place . It was ridiculous : I would be all covered with fluff when I came out . But having taken the step I refused to turn back . There would be no dignity at all in crawling out from under the bedspread , trailing dust , like a weevil coming out of a flour - barrel . It would be admitting JJhad done the wrong thing . There I was , and there I would stay until forcibly removed . 76 My resentment at Peter for letting me remain crushed under the bed while he moved up there in the open , in the free air , jabbering away about exposure times , started me thinking about the past four months . All summer we had been moving in a certain direction , though it had n't felt like movement : we had deluded ourselves into thinking we were static . Ainsley had warned me that Peter was monopolizing me ; she saw no reason why I should n't , as she termed it , "
31997	32134	31705	31705	Marian	112	" . This was all very well for her but I could n't get over the subjective feeling that more than one at a time was unethical . However it had left me in a sort of vacuum . Peter and I had avoided talking about the future because we knew it did n't matter : we were n't really involved . Now , though , something in me had decided we were involved : surely that was the explanation for the powder - room collapse and the flight . Lwas^evading reality . Now , this very moment , I would have to face it . I would have to decide what I wanted to do . Someone sat down heavily on the bed , mashing me against the floor . I gave a dusty squawk . "
32140	32150	32151	32151	Someone	2198	" whoever it was exclaimed , and stood up . "
32157	32177	32151	32151	Someone	2198	" I could hear them conferring in low tones , and then Peter called , much louder than necessary , "
32186	32187	32181	32181	you	112	" "
32190	32209	32181	32181	you	112	" I answered in a neutral voice . I had decided to be noncommittal about the whole thing . "
32219	32224	32212	32212	you	112	" he said carefully . "
32236	32269	32270	32270	I	0	" They were treating me like a sulking child who has locked itself in a cupboard and has to be coaxed . I was amused , and indignant . I considered saying , "
32276	32297	32270	32270	I	0	" but decided that it might be the last straw for Peter , and Len was quite capable of saying , "
32333	32339	32340	32340	I	0	" So instead I said , "
32347	32367	32368	32368	We	692	" I tried to move : I was stuck . Up above , they had another policy - meeting . "
32377	32381	32368	32368	We	692	" Peter called , "
32391	32432	32384	32384	you	0	" I heard them giving orders to each other . It was going to be a major 77 feat of engineering skill . There was a scuffling of shoes as they took their positions and got purchase . Then Peter said "
32435	32486	32384	32384	you	0	" and the bed rose into the air , and I scuttled out backwards like a crayfish when its rock has been upset . Peter stood me up . Every inch of my dress was furred and tufted with dust . They both started to brush me off , laughing . "
32496	32539	32491	32491	you	0	" Peter asked . I could tell by the way they were picking off the larger pieces of dust , slowly and making an effort to concentrate , that they 'd put away a lot of brandy while I was below ground . "
32544	32549	32491	32491	you	0	" I said sullenly . "
32559	32566	32550	32550	You	0	" he said with magnanimous gallantry . "
32580	32587	32575	32575	You	0	" He was superior and amused . "
32590	32594	32595	32595	I	0	" I said , "
32603	32684	32685	32685	he	693	" I had realized by this time what my prevailing emotion was : it was rage . The hot needle of anger in my voice must have penetrated the cuticle of Peter 's euphoria . He stepped back a pace ; his eyes seemed to measure me coldly . He took me by the upper arm as though he was arresting me for jaywalking , and turned to Len / T really think we 'd better be pushing along now , "
32688	32718	32685	32685	he	693	" It 's been awfully pleasant . I hope we can get together again sometime soon . I 'd really like to see what you think of my tripod . "
32749	32763	32745	32745	I	0	" I 'm not going back with you . I 'll walk home , "
32770	32778	32779	32779	Peter	53	" Do whatever the hell you like , "
32809	32841	32806	32806	Len	87	" Why do n't we have another drink , Ainsley ? I 'll see that you get home safely ; better let the two love - birds settle their own affairs , "
32848	32857	32806	32806	Len	87	" Oh , I do n't think I should "
33200	33207	33208	33208	he	53	" Would you kindly permit me , "
33216	33235	33208	33208	he	53	" to drive you home ? I would n't want to see you get drenched to the skin . "
33355	33358	33359	33359	I	0	" Well , "
33363	33377	33359	33359	I	0	" really I 'd rather walk . Though thank you just the same . "
33378	33389	33390	33390	he	53	" Oh come along Marian , do n't be childish , "
33447	33461	33462	33462	he	53	" Now perhaps you 'll tell me what all that nonsense was about , "
33515	33525	33526	33526	I	0	" I did n't request to be driven home , "
33600	33617	33618	33618	he	53	" Why the hell you had to ruin a perfectly good evening I 'll never know , "
33632	33645	33646	33646	I	0	" I do n't seem to have ruined it much for you , "
33649	33655	33646	33646	I	0	" You were enjoyingyourself enough . "
33656	33702	33622	33622	my	0	" Oh so that 's it . We were n't entertaining you enough . Our conversation bored you , we were n't paying enough attention to you . Well , next time we 'll know enough to save you the trouble of coming with us . "
33718	33727	33728	33728	I	0	" Len 's my friend , you know , "
33738	33764	33731	33731	My	0	" I do n't see why I should n't want to talk with him a little myself when he 's just got back from England . "

33799	33807	33795	33795	he	87	" you 're just rejecting your femininity . "
33817	33824	33825	33825	I	0	" Oh , screw my femininity , "
33828	33844	33825	33825	I	0	" Femininity has nothing to do with it . You were just being plain ordinary rude\ "

34324	34341	34305	34305	me	0	" Peter , why ca n't you be serious ? You 're just an overgrown adolescent . "
34354	34395	34289	34289	His	53	" Here we are/ ' he said . I took hold of the doorhandle , intending , I think , to make a final unanswerable remark and dash for the house ; but he put his hand on my arm . "
34405	34498	34289	34289	His	53	" He turned the ignition key and the heartbeats of the windshieldwipers stopped . We sat silently , listening to the storm . It must have been right overhead ; the lightning was dazzling and continuous , and each probing jagged fork was followed almost at once by a rending crash , like the trees of a whole forest splitting and falling . In the intervals of darkness we heard the rain pounding against the car ; water was coming through in a fine spray around the edges of the closed windows . "
34512	34586	34504	34504	I	0	" Peter said in the tone of a man who has made a firm and proper decision . I could only agree . During a long nickering moment of light I turned and saw him watching me , his face strangely shadowed , his eyes gleaming like an animal 's in the beam from a car headlight . His stare was intent , faintly ominous . Then he leaned towards me and said , "
34596	34655	34504	34504	I	0	" His hands fumbled against my head : he was awkwardly but with gentleness untangling a piece of dust that was caught in my hair . I suddenly felt limp as a damp kleenex . I leaned my forehead against his and closed my eyes . His skin was cold and wet and his breath smelled of cognac . "
34660	34691	34692	34692	You	728	" he said . I did : we still had our foreheads pressed together , and I found myself at the next bright instant gazing into a multitude of eyes . "
34698	34757	34692	34692	You	728	" I said softly . We both laughed and he pulled me against him and kissed me . I put my arms around his back . We rested quietly like that for some time in the centre of the storm . I was conscious only that I was very tired and that my body would not stop shivering . "
34768	34785	34786	34786	Marian	112	" I murmured . He stroked my hair , forgiving , understanding , a little patronizing . "
34788	34822	34786	34786	Marian	112	" I could feel his neck swallow . I could n't tell now whether it was his body or my own that was shuddering ; he tight- 82 ened his arms around me . "
34845	35145	34837	34837	you	112	" I drew back from him . A tremendous electric blue flash , very near , illuminated the inside of the car . As we stared at each other in that brief light I could see myself , small and oval , mirrored in his eyes . 10 When I woke up on Sunday morning - it was closer to Sunday afternoon - my mind was at first as empty as though someone had scooped out the inside of my skull like a cantaloupe and left me only the rind to think with . I looked around the room , scarcely recognizing it as a place I had ever been before . My clothes were scattered over the floor and draped and crumpled on the chairback like fragments left over from the explosion of some life - sized female scarecrow , and the inside of my mouth felt like a piece of cotton wool stuffing . I got up and wavered out to the kitchen . Clear sunshine and fresh air were shimmering in through the open kitchen window . Ainsley was up before me . She was leaning forward , concentrating on something that was spread out in front of her , her legs drawn up and tucked under her on the chair , her hair cascading over her shoulders . From the back she looked like a mermaid perched on a rock : a mermaid in a grubby green terrycloth robe . Around her on a table - top pebbled with crumbs lay the remnants of her breakfast - a limp starfish of a banana peel , some bits of shell , and brown crusts of toast beached here and there , random as driftwood . I went to the refrigerator and got out the tomato juice . "
35148	35170	34837	34837	you	112	" I said to Ainsley 's back . I was wondering whether I could face an egg . She turned around . "
35173	35177	34837	34837	you	112	" she said . "
35184	35188	35179	35179	you	732	" I asked . "
35195	35210	35179	35179	you	732	" I poured myself a large glassful of tomato juice and drank it bloodthirstily . "
35214	35218	35179	35179	you	732	" she said . "
35315	35334	35335	35335	You	732	" I looked into the saucepan that was sitting , still hot , on one of the burners . "
35342	35349	35335	35335	You	732	" I switched the stove on . "
35387	35388	35383	35385	a real idiot	738	" "
35393	35444	35389	35389	We	739	" I said , a little reluctantly . I knew she would disapprove . I manoeuvred the egg into the saucepan ; it cracked immediately . It was straight out of the refrigerator and too cold . Ainsley lifted her barely - nubile eyebrows ; she did n't seem surprised . "
35491	35497	35498	35498	Peter	53	" she continued more cheerfully , "
35550	35551	35546	35546	you	737	" "
35554	35558	35546	35546	you	737	" I said , "
35568	35705	35708	35708	you	737	" That silenced her . It was like invoking a deity . I inspected my egg , which was sending out a white semi - congealed feeler like an exploring oyster . It 's probably done , I thought , and fished it out . I turned on the coffee and cleared a space for myself on the oilcloth . Now I could see what Ainsley was busy with . She had taken the calendar down from the kitchen wall - it had a picture of a little girl in an old - fashioned dress sitting on a swing with a basket of cherries and a white puppy - I get one every year from a third cousin who runs a service station back home - and was making cryptic marks on it with a pencil . "
35711	35752	35708	35708	you	737	" I asked . I whacked my egg against the side of my dish and got my thumb stuck in it . It was n't done after all . I poured it into the dish and stirred it up . 84 "
35760	35772	35753	35753	I	0	" she said in a matter - of - fact voice . "
35791	35804	35753	35753	I	0	" I said , eyeing the black numbers in their ordered rows . "
35814	35843	35850	35850	Len	87	" Her tone implied I was trying to snatch bread from the mouths of all the world 's widows and orphans , incarnate for the moment in her . "
35893	35894	35890	35891	others around	747	" "
35910	35915	35902	35908	nobody who 's such a good specimen	748	" she said reasonably , "
35964	35965	35967	35967	you	0	" "
35972	35985	35967	35967	you	0	" I asked acidly , spooning up the last strand of egg . "
35989	35995	35967	35967	you	0	" said Ainsley with enthusiasm , "
36117	36122	36123	36125	some real geniuses	759	" she went on ; "
36135	36164	36123	36125	some real geniuses	759	" She put a decisive - looking checkmark on the calendar and frowned at it . She bore a chilling resemblance to a general plotting a major jcampaign . "
36178	36182	36123	36125	some real geniuses	759	" I said , "
36216	36217	36196	36196	you	52	" "
36224	36237	36196	36196	you	52	" she said . Now she was counting under her breath . 85 "
36247	36248	36196	36196	you	52	" "
36253	36262	36196	36196	you	52	" she said , and counted some more . "
36300	36301	36282	36282	I	0	" "
36306	36307	36282	36282	I	0	" "
36310	36314	36282	36282	I	0	" she said , "
36475	36479	36469	36469	he	762	" she said , "
36489	36497	36469	36469	he	762	" We ruminated together for some moments . "
36508	36512	36469	36469	he	762	" she said . "
36538	36543	36526	36526	My	0	" She smiled briefly . "
36576	36577	36570	36570	his	762	" "
36580	36581	36570	36570	his	762	" "
36585	36854	36570	36570	his	762	" she said firmly , sliding off her chair . I was silent : the thought of Leonard Slank being undone beneath the same roof that also sheltered the lady down below and her framed familytree was disturbing to me ; it would almost be a sacrilege . Ainsley went into her bedroom , humming busily to herself , taking the calendar with her . I sat thinking about Len . I was again having stirrings of conscience about allowing him to be led flowergarlanded to his doom without even so much as a word of warning . Of course he had asked for it , in a way , I supposed , and Ainsley seemed determined not to make any further claims on whoever she singled out for this somewhat dubious , because anonymous , honour . If Leonard had been merely the standardized ladies'-man I would n't have worried . But surely he was , I reflected as I sipped my coffee , a more complex and delicately - adjusted creature . He was 86 a self - consciously - lecherous skirt - chaser , granted ; but it was n't true as Joe had said , that he had no ethical sense . In his own warped wayhe was a kind of inverted moralist . He liked to talk as though everyone was out for nothing but sex and money , but when anyone provided a demonstration of his theories in real life , he reacted with scalding critical invective . His blend of cynicism and idealism had a lot to do with his preference for "
36856	36910	36911	36911	She	769	" , as he called it , greenish girls , as opposed to the more vine - ripened variety . The supposedly pure , ^e unobtainable^ was attractive to the idealist in him ; but as soon as it had been„DJbj^ined ? the cynic viewed , it as spoiled and threw it away . "
36926	37150	36911	36911	She	769	" he would remark sourly . Women whom he thought of as truly out of his reach , such as the wives of his friends , he treated with devotion . He trusted them to an unrealistic degree simply because he would never be compelled by his own cynicism to put them to the test : they were not only unassailable but too old for him anyway . Clara , for instance , he idolized . At times he showed a peculiar tenderness , almost a sloppy sentimentality , towards the people he liked , who were few in number ; but in spite of this he was constantly accused by women of being a misogynist and by men of being a misanthropist , and perhaps he was both . However , I could think of no specific way in which Ainsley 's making use of him as she had planned could damage him irreparably , or even much at all , so I consigned him to whatever tough - minded , horn - rimmed guardian angels he might possess , finished the granular dregs of my coffee , and went to dress . After that I phoned Clara to tell her the news ; Ainsley 's reaction had not been very satisfying . Clara sounded pleased , but her response was ambiguous . "
37155	37159	37160	37160	Joe	82	" she said , "
37179	37322	37165	37165	He	82	" I was slightly irritated : after all , I was n't thirty - five and desperate . She was talking as though I was simply taking a prudent step . But I reflected that people on the outside of a relationship could n't be expected to understand it . The rest of the conversation was about her digestive upsets . As I was washing the breakfast dishes I heard footsteps coming up our stairs . That was another variation of the door - opening 87 gambit employed by the lady down below : she would let people in quietly without announcing them , usually at times of disintegration like Sunday afternoons , doubtless hoping that we 'd be caught in some awkward state , with our hair up in curlers or down in wisps , or lolling about in bur bathrobes . "
37325	37346	37324	37324	I	0	" a voice said , halfway up . It was Peter 's . He had already assumed impromptu visiting privileges . "
37349	37360	37361	37361	I	0	" I answered , making my voice casual but welcoming . "
37368	37404	37405	37405	Boy	773	" I added inanely as his head emerged from the stairwell . I left the rest of the dishes in the sink and dried my hands on my apron . He came into the kitchen . "
37407	37411	37405	37405	Boy	773	" he said , "
37455	37524	37433	37433	I	0	" His tone was half - proud , halfapologetic . We scanned each other warily . If there was going to be a retraction from either side , this was the moment for it ; the whole thing could be blamed on organic chemistry . But neither of us backed down . Finally Peter grinned at me , a pleased though nervous grin . I said , solicitously , "
37544	37545	37531	37531	You	0	" "
37549	37572	37531	37531	You	0	" he said , and came over and pecked me on the cheek , then collapsed on one of the kitchen chairs . "
37590	37591	37578	37578	I	0	" "
37596	37658	37578	37578	I	0	" I said . He did look hung - over . He was carelessly dressed , but it 's impossible for Peter to dress with genuine carelessness . This was an arranged carelessness ; he was meticulously unshaven , and his socks matched the colour of the paint - stains on his sports - shirt . I turned on the coffee . "
37661	37751	37752	37752	You	774	" he said , just as Ainsley had but with a very different emphasis . He sounded as though he 'd just bought a shiny new car . I gave him a tender chrome - plated smile ; that is , I meant the smile to express tenderness , but my mouth felt stiff and bright and somehow expensive . I poured two cups of coffee , got out the milk and sat down in the other kitchen chair . He put one of his hands over mine . 88 "
37755	37759	37752	37752	You	774	" he said , "
37776	37789	37790	37790	I	0	" I nodded : I had n't thought I was , either . "
37800	37807	37792	37792	I	0	" I had been , too . "
37844	37895	37838	37838	I	0	" I was seeing him in a new light : he was changing form in the kitchen , turning from a reckless young bachelor into a rescuer from chaos , a provider of stability . Somewhere in the vaults of Seymour Surveys an invisible hand was wiping away my signature . "
37966	37973	37961	37964	a queer or something	780	" He paused , then continued , "
38038	38076	38016	38016	^	106	" I did n't feel very sensible . I lowered my eyes modestly and fixed them upon a toast crumb that had eluded me when I wiped the table . I was n't sure what to say - "
38082	38088	38089	38089	I	0	" did n't seem appropriate . "
38095	38099	38089	38089	I	0	" I said . "
38110	38132	38089	38089	I	0	" He followed me in ; we set our cups on the round coffee table and sat down on the chesterfield . "
38138	38146	38133	38133	I	0	" he said , glancing over it . "
38152	38223	38133	38133	I	0	" He put his arm around my shoulders , and we sat in what I hoped was a blissful silence . We were awkward with each other . We no longer had the assumptions , the tracks and paths of our former relationship to guide us . Until we 'd established the new assumptions we would n't know quite what to do or say . Peter chuckled to himself . 89 "
38228	38232	38290	38290	I	0	" I asked . "
38274	38284	38264	38264	We	789	" He was still pleased with himself about that . "
38322	38331	38332	38332	he	791	" When do you want to get married ? "
38364	38370	38355	38355	he	791	" What about Groundhog Day ? "
38385	38405	38406	38406	I	0	" I 'd rather have you decide that . I 'd rather leave the big decisions up to you . "

39936	39960	39933	39933	he	845	" now I know who you are . I did n't place you at first . Without that official shejlyoujook sorLof - exposed . "
40052	40056	40057	40057	he	845	" Those yours ? "
40062	40065	40066	40066	I	0	" No , "
40071	40084	40066	40066	I	0	" Did n't think so . They did n't look like you . "
40247	40254	40255	40255	he	845	" The only thing about laundromats , "
40258	40299	40255	40255	he	845	" is that you 're always finding other people 's pubic hairs in the washers . Not that I mind particularly . I 'm not picky about germs or anything . It 's just rather gross . Have some chocolate ? "
40318	40322	40323	40323	I	0	" No thanks , "
40326	40342	40343	40343	He	845	" I do n't like it much either but I 'm trying to quit smoking . "
40438	40446	40447	40447	he	845	" I sort of like watching them , "
40450	40516	40447	40447	he	845	" I watch laundromat washers the way other people watch television , it 's soothing because you always know what to expect and you do n't have to think about it . Except I can vary my programmes a little ; if I get tired of watching the same stuff I can always put in a pair of green socks or something colourful like that . "
40554	40631	40632	40632	He	845	" I come here quite a lot ; sometimes I just have to get out of that apartment . It 's all right as long as I have something to iron ; I like flattening things out , getting rid of the wrinkles , it gives me something to do with my hands , but when I run out of things to iron , well , I have to come here . To get some more . "
40688	41160	41161	41161	he	853	" I have to get out , it 's that apartment . In the summer it 's like a hot , dark oven , and when it 's that hot you do n't even want to turn on the iron . There is n't enough space anyway but the heat makes it shrink , the others get too close . I can feel them even in my own room with the door closed ; I can tell what they 're doing . Fish barricades himself into that chair and hardly moves , even when he 's writing , and then he tears it all up and says it 's no good and sits there for days staring at the pieces of paper on the floor ; once he got down on his hands and knees and tried to put them together again with scotch - tape , and failed of course , and threw a real scene and accused both of us of trying to use his ideas to publish first and stealing some of the pieces . And Trevor , when he is n't away at summer school or heating the apartment up cooking twelve - course dinners , I 'd just as soon eat canned salmon , practises his fifteenth - century Italian calligraphy , scrollwork and flourishes , and goes on and on about the quattrocento . He has an amazing memory for detail . I guess it 's interesting but somehow it is n't the answer , at least not for me , and I do n't think it really is for him either . The thing is , they repeat themselves and repeat themselves but they never get anywhere , they never seem to finish anything . Of course I 'm no better , I 'm just the same , I 'm stuck on that wretched term paper . Once I went to the zoo and there was a cage with a frenzied armadillo in it going around in figure - eights , just around and around in the same path . I can still remember the funny metallic sound its feet made on the bottom of the cage . They say all caged animals get that way when they 're caged , it 's a form of psychosis , and even if you set the animals free after they go like that they 'll just run around in the same pattern . You read and read T.E.W.-4 95 the material and after you 've read the twentieth article you ca n't make any sense out of it anymore , and then you start thinking about the number of books that are published in any given year , in any given month , in any given week , and that 's just too much . Words , "
41191	41199	41161	41161	he	853	" are beginning to lose their meanings . "
41237	41247	41248	41248	I	0	" I gather you 're all students , then , "
41251	41255	41256	41256	he	853	" Of course , "
41260	41318	41256	41256	he	853	" could n't you tell ? We 're all graduate students . In English . All of us . I thought everyone in the whole city was ; we 're so totally inbred that we never see anyone else . It was quite strange when you walked in the other day and turned out not to be . "
41319	41330	41331	41331	I	0	" I always thought that would be sort of exciting . "
41363	41366	41367	41367	He	853	" Exciting . "
41371	41666	41667	41667	He	855	" I used to think that . It looks exciting when you 're an eager brilliant undergraduate . They all say , Go on to graduate studies , and they give you a bit of money ; and so you do , and you think , Now I 'm going to find out the real truth . But you do n't find out , exactly , and things get pickier and pickier and more and more stale , and it all collapses in a welter of commas and shredded footnotes , and after a while it 's like anything else : you 've got stuck in it and you ca n't get out , and you wonder how you got there in the first place . If this were the States I could excuse myself by saying I 'm avoiding the draft , but , as it is , there 's no good reason . And besides that , everything 's being done , it 's been done already , fished out , and you yourself wallowing around in the dregs at the bottom of the barrel , one of those ninth - yea * graduate students , poor bastards , scrabbling through manuscripts for new material or slaving away on the definitive edition of Ruskin 's dinner - invitations and theatre - stubs or trying to squeeze the last 96 pimple of significance out of some fraudulent literary nonentity they dug up somewhere . Poor old Fischer is writing his thesis now , he wanted to do it on Womb Symbols in D. H. Lawrence but they all told him that had been done . So now he 's got some impossible theory that gets more and more incoherent as he goes along . "
41670	41677	41678	41678	I	0	" Oh , what is it ? "
41688	41740	41678	41678	I	0	" I do n't really know . He wo n't even talk about it anymore except when he 's loaded , and then no one can understand him . That 's why he keeps tearing it up - he reads it over and he ca n't understand any of it himself . "
41741	41750	41751	41751	I	0	" And what are you doing yours on ? "
41757	41821	41872	41872	he	855	" I have n't got to that point yet . I do n't know when I ever will or what will happen then . I try not to think about it . Right now I 'm supposed to be writing an overdue term paper from the year before last . I write a sentence a day . On good days , that is . "
41839	41851	41832	41832	He	855	" Well , what 's your term - paper on then ? "
41888	41897	41898	41898	he	855	" You do n't really want to know , "
41901	41918	41898	41898	he	855	" Pre - Raphaelite pornography . I 'm trying to do something with Beardsley , too . "
41919	41922	41923	41923	We	857	" Oh . "
41935	41938	41939	41939	I	0	" Maybe , "
41944	41961	41939	41939	I	0	" you 're in the wrong business . Maybe you might be happier doing something else . "
41969	41975	41976	41976	he	855	" I should stop smoking , "
41979	42091	41976	41976	he	855	" What else can I do ? Once you 've gone this far you are n't fit for anything else . Something happens to your mind . You 're overqualified , overspecialized , and everybody knows it . Nobody in any other game would be crazy enough to hire me . I would n't even make a good ditch - digger , I 'd start tearing apart the sewer - system , trying to pick - axe and unearth all those chthonic symbols - pipes , valves , cloacal conduits . ... No , no . I 'll have to be a slave in the paper - mines for all time . "
42132	42140	42141	42141	I	0	" Are you from out of town ? "
42156	42399	42141	42141	I	0	" Of course , we all are ; nobody really comes from here , do they ? That 's why we 've got that apartment , god knows we ca n't afford it but there are n't any graduate residences . Unless you count that new pseudo - British joint with the coat of arms and the monastery wall . But they 'd never let me in and it would be just as bad as living with Trevor anyway . Trevor 's from Montreal , the family is sort of Westmount and well - off ; but they had to go into trade after the war . They own a coconut - cookie factory but we are n't supposed to refer to it around the apartment ; it 's awkward though , these mounds of coconut cookies keep appearing and you have to eat them while pretending you do n't know where they come from . I do n't like coconut . Fish was from Vancouver , he keeps missing the sea . He goes down to the lakeshore and wades through the pollution and tries to turn himself on with seagulls and floating grapefruit peels , but it does n't work . Both of them used to have accents but now you ca n't tell anything from listening to them ; after you 've been in that braingrinder for a while you do n't sound as though you 're from anywhere . "
42400	42406	42141	42141	I	0	" Where are you from ? "
42407	42415	42416	42416	he	862	" You 've never heard of it , "
42501	42506	42507	42507	he	864	" The thing is , "
42512	42566	42507	42507	he	864	" it 's the inertia . You never feel you 're getting anywhere ; you get bogged down in things , waterlogged . Last week I set fire to the apartment , partly on purpose . I think I wanted to see what they would do . Maybe I wanted to see what i "
42618	42620	42598	42598	they	866	" sick "
42740	42754	42734	42734	They	866	" He dropped his cigarette stub on the floor and ground it underfoot . "
42761	42765	42757	42757	they	866	" he added . "
42768	42773	42757	42757	they	866	" 1 said cautiously , "
42779	42786	42757	42757	they	866	" He smiled his crooked smile . "
42815	43152	42804	42804	they	866	" He hunched his shoulders further up around his neck . I looked at the side of his thin face , the high stark ridge of his cheekbone , the dark hollow of his eye , marvelling : all this talking , this rather liquid confessing , was something I did n't think I could ever bring myself to do . It seemed foolhardy to me , like an uncooked egg deciding to come out of its shell : there would be a risk of spreading out too far , turning into a formless puddle . But sitting there with the plug of a fresh cigarette stoppering his mouth he did n't appear to be sensing any danger of that kind . Thinking about it later , I 'm surprised at my own detachment . My restlessness of the afternoon had vanished ; I felt calm , serene as a stone moon , in control of the whole white space of the laundromat . I could have reached out effortlessly and put my arms around that huddled awkward body and consoled it , rocked it gently . Still , there was something most unchildlike about him , something that suggested rather an unnaturally old man , old far beyond consolation . I thought too , remembering his duplicity about the beer - interview , that he was no doubt capable of making it all up . It may have been real enough ; but then again , it may have been calculated to evoke just such a mothering reaction , so that he could smile cleverly at the gesture and retreat further into the sanctuary of his sweater , refusing to be reached or touched . 99 , ' ~ * He must have been equipped with a kind of science - fiction extra 4 sense , a third eye or an antenna . Although his face was turned i away so that he could n't see mine , he said in a soft dry voice , "
43194	43208	43209	43209	You	870	" He was looking at me now , ) ~ cunningly , sideways . "
43229	43233	43222	43223	Florence Nightingale	110	" you know . "
43282	43288	43289	43289	I	0	" Thanks for the soap , "
43309	43315	43316	43316	he	874	" That 's all right , "

45385	45420	45374	45374	She	112	" We would like to examine the condition of your razorblade . Would you give me the razorblade that is now in your razor ? Here is a new one in return for it , "
45424	45426	45374	45374	She	112	" please "

46376	46406	46408	46408	Lucy	72	" What I ca n't understand is the ones that come back from women with no checked in all the boxes . What on earth do they use then ? "
46411	46419	46408	46408	Lucy	72	" Well this lady 's over eighty . "
46420	46435	46352	46352	Millie	71	" Here 's one who says she 's been pregnant for seven years straight . "
46436	46443	46445	46445	Emmy	71	" Oh no , poor thing , "
46451	46459	46445	46445	Emmy	71	" Why she 'll ruin her health . "
46460	46498	46500	46500	Lucy	72	" I bet that dumb cluck Mrs. Lietch - or Mrs. Hatcher , whoever it was - sent them to Indian reservations again . I specifically told her not to . The lord knows what they use , "
46502	46505	46506	46506	Millie	71	" Moss , "
46534	46571	46524	46524	She	71	" We 're going to have to start it all over again and the client will be furious . All our quotas are thrown off and I hate to think what 'll happen to our deadlines . "
46753	46761	46751	46751	she	112	" Let 's go have lunch now . "
46762	46767	46751	46751	she	112	" Well . . . "
46797	46803	46805	46805	Lucy	72	" Yes , let 's , "
46807	46824	46805	46805	Lucy	72	" this is driving me bats , I 've just got to get out of here . "
46952	46955	46956	46956	Emmy	71	" OOoo , "
46966	46992	46956	46956	Emmy	71	" In this dry weather I just do n't know what I 'll do . My skin 's just all drying up and flaking away . "
47038	47045	47046	47046	Millie	71	" Cold cream 's the best , "
47049	47063	47046	47046	Millie	71	" My gran had dry skin too and that 's what she used . "
47064	47074	47075	47075	Emmy	71	" But I 've heard it gives you pimples , "
47566	47571	47572	47572	Lucy	72	" How 's Peter ? "
47679	47682	47683	47683	she	112	" There , "
47696	47702	47683	47683	she	112	" All stored neatly away . "
47712	47716	47717	47717	Marian	112	" Just fine , "
47782	47791	47792	47792	she	112	" I have something to tell you all , "
47795	47807	47808	47808	She	112	" but it is n't to go any further just now . "
47830	47835	47836	47836	She	112	" We 're engaged . "
47861	47864	47854	47854	Lucy	72	" No ! "
47867	47871	47872	47872	Millie	71	" how wonderful ! "
47875	47881	47872	47872	Millie	71	" Oh . Jolly good . "
47998	48024	47994	47994	Lucy	72	" I always thought he was the confirmed bachelor type , that 's what you said . How on earth did you ever catch him ? "
48053	48060	48061	48061	she	112	" I honestly do n't know , "
48129	48135	48120	48120	Lucy	72	" It 's the man ! "
48191	48229	48230	48230	He	53	" Hi honey how are you ? Listen , I really ca n't make it tonight . A case came up suddenly , something big , and I 've just got to do some work on it . "
48274	48297	48267	48267	he	53	" 3 asked her to have dinner ; since then she 'd been looking forward to it . She said rather sharply , "
48322	48323	48324	48324	I	0	" "
48331	48337	48324	48324	I	0	" he said with irritation . "
48347	48348	48339	48339	you	112	" "
48353	48359	48349	48349	I	0	" he said , exasperated . "
48378	48418	48444	48444	you	112	" The rest of the conversation was a tangle of retractions and conciliations . Well , we have to learn to compromise , Marian thought , and we might as well begin working at it now . She concluded , "
48422	48423	48444	48444	you	112	" "
48427	48431	48444	48444	you	112	" he said , "
48459	48514	48515	48515	I	0	" When Marian had said good - bye sweetly for the benefit of her audience and had put down the phone^he felt exhausted . She must watch how she spoke to Peter , she woulcTllaveto handle him more carefully , there was evidently a good deal of pressure on him at his office . ... "
48523	48666	48667	48667	I	0	" she said to herself as she turned back to the typewriter . After she had finished the razorbkde questionnaire and had begun to work on a different one , the instructions for a producttest of a new dehydrated dog - food , the phone rang again . It was Joe Bates . She had been half - expecting the call . She greeted Joe with false enthusiasm : she knew she had been shirking her responsibilities lately , avoiding the Bates ' dinner - invitations even though Clara had been wanting to see her . The pregnancy had gone first one week , then two weeks longer than it was supposed to , and Clara had sounded over the phone as though she herself was being dragged slowly down into the gigantic pumpkin - like growth that was enveloping her body . "
48673	48726	48667	48667	I	0	" she had groaned . But Marian had not been able to face another evening of contemplating Clara 's belly and speculating with her on the mysterious behaviour of its contents . She had responded the last time only with cheerful but notably uncheering remarks intended to lighten the atmosphere , such as "
48734	48736	48667	48667	I	0	" and "
48771	48845	48667	48667	I	0	" After that evening she had rationalized that she would do Clara more harm by 114 going to see her than by staying away . In a spurt of solicitude catalysed by guilt , though , she had made Joe promise as she was leaving to let her know as soon as anything happened , even offering heroically to babysit for the others if absolutely necessary ; and now his voice was saying , "
48889	48890	48879	48879	she	1011	" "
48896	48930	48932	48932	her	1011	" Marian exclaimed , and added various inquiries and congratulations . She got the visiting hours and the * room - number from Joe and wrote them down on her telephone-/ messages pad . "
48942	49369	49370	49370	she	1015	" she said . She was thinking that now Clara was deflating toward j her normal size again she would be able to talk with her more j freely : she would no longer feel as though she was addressing a \ swollen mass of flesh with a tiny pinhead , a shape that had made her I think of a queen - ant , bulging with the burden of an entire society , ! a semi - person - or sometimes , she thought , several people , a cluster of hidden personalities that she did n't know at all . She decided on impulse to buy her some roses : a welcoming - back gift for ^the real Clara , once more in uncontended possession of her own fra!Tbody7 She settled the phone in its black cradle and leaned back in her chair . The second - hand on the clock was sweeping around , accompanied by the ticking of typewriters and the click - clack of highheeled shoes on the hard floor . She could feel time eddying and curling almost visibly around her feet , rising around her , lifting her body in the office - chair and bearing her , slowly and circuitously but with the inevitability of water moving downhill , towards the distant , not - so - distant - anymore day they had agreed on - in late March ? - that would end this phase and begin another . Somewhere else , arrangements were being gradually made ; the relatives were beginning to organize their forces and energies , it was all being taken care of , there was nothing for her to do . She was floating , lettingjhe current hold her up , trusting to it to take her where she was going . Now there was this day to get through : a landmark to be passed on the shore , a tree not much different from any of the 115 others that could be distinguished from the rest only by being here rather than further back or further on , with no other purpose than to measure the distance travelled . She wanted to get it behind her . To help the propelling second hand she typed out the rest of the dog - food questionnaire . Towards the end of the afternoon Mrs. Bogue sauntered out of her cubicle . The upwardly - arranged lines on her brow expressed consternation , but her eyes were level as ever . ' Oh dear , "
49396	49422	49370	49370	she	1015	" What a day . Not only that disturbance in the West , but there 's been some trouble with that horrible Underwear Man again . "
49423	49429	49430	49430	Lucy	72	" Not that filthy man ! "
49440	49443	49445	49446	Mrs. Bogue	69	" Yes , "
49448	49454	49455	49455	She	1015	" it 's so upsetting . "
49472	49532	49464	49464	She	1015	" He seems to have shifted his field of operations to the suburbs , to Etobicoke as a matter of fact . I 've had two ladies from Etobicoke on the phone this afternoon complaining . Of course he 's probably some nice ordinary man , perfectly harmless , but it 's so nasty for the company 's image . "
49533	49539	49541	49541	Marian	112	" What does he do ? "
49553	49556	49558	49558	Lucy	72	" Oh , "
49560	49586	49558	49558	Lucy	72	" he 's one of those dirty men who phone women and say filthy things to them . He was doing it last year too . "
49587	49592	49593	49594	Mrs. Bogue	69	" The trouble is , "
49606	49745	49593	49594	Mrs. Bogue	69	" he tells them he 's from our company . Apparently he has a very convincing voice . Very official . He says he 's doing a survey on underwear , and I guess the first questions he asks must sound genuine . Brands and types and sizes and things . Then he gets more and more personal until the ladies get annoyed and hang up . Of course then they phone the company to complain , and sometimes they 've accused us of all sorts of indecent things before I can explain that he 's not one of our interviewers and our company would never ask questions like that . I wish they 'd catch him and ask him to stop , he 's such a nuisance , but of course he 's almost impossible to trace . "
49747	49755	49756	49756	Marian	112	" I wonder why he does it ? "
49759	49772	49773	49773	Lucy	72	" Oh , he 's probably one of those sex - fiends , "
49792	49823	49781	49782	Mrs. Bogue	69	" But they all say he sounds so nice . So normal and even intelligent . Not at all like thoseawful people who call you up and breathe at you . "
49824	49840	49841	49841	Marian	112	" Maybe it all proves that some sex - fiends are very nice normal people , "
50203	50386	50181	50181	His	53	" 7 back at a cruel world that saddled him with crushing legal duties and prevented him from taking her to dinner . And he had got the company name and the knowledge of official interviewing procedures , of course , from her ! Perhaps this was his true self , the core of his personality , the central Peter who had been occupying her mind more and more lately . Perhaps this was what lay hidden under the surface , under the other surfaces , that secret identity which in spite of her many guesses and attempts and half - successes she was aware she had still not uncovered : he was really the Underwear Man . The first thing Marian 's eyes encountered as her head emerged periscope - like through the stairwell was a pair of naked legs . They were topped by Ainsley , who was standing half - dressed in the small vestibule , gazing down upon her , the usual blankness of her face tinged almost imperceptibly here and there with shades of surprise and annoyance . "
50389	50393	50394	50394	I	0	" she said . "
50404	50437	50394	50394	I	0	" She fastened her eyes accusingly upon the small bag of groceries Marian was carrying . Marian 's legs pushed the rest of her body up the remaining stairs before she answered . "
50454	50482	50483	50483	Marian	112	" She went into the kitchen and deposited the paper bag on the table . Ainsley followed her in and sat down on one of the chairs . "
50485	50490	50483	50483	Marian	112	" she said dramatically , "
50497	50498	50483	50483	Marian	112	" "
50502	50522	50523	50523	It	1040	" Marian asked vaguely , putting her carton of milk into the refrigerator . She was n't really listening . "
50530	50554	50525	50525	Leonard	87	" Marian had been so occupied with her own thoughts that it was a moment before she remembered what Ainsley was talking about . "
50559	50998	50525	50525	Leonard	87	" she said . She took off her coat , reflectively . 118 She had n't been paying close attention to the progress of Ainsley 's campaign ( or was it Leonard 's ? ) over the past two months - she 'd wanted to keep her hands clean of the whole thing - but she had been force - fed enough with Ainsley 's own accounts and analyses and complaints to be able to deduce what had been happening ; after all , however clean one 's hands , one 's ears were of necessity open . Things had n't gone according to schedule . It appeared that Ainsley had overshot the mark . At the first encounter she had made herself into an image of such pink - gingham purity that Len had decided , after her strategic repulse of him that evening , that she would require an extra - long and careful siege . Anything too abrupt , too muscular , would frighten her away ; she would have to be trapped with gentleness and caution . Consequently he had begun by asking her to lunch several times , and had progressed , at intervals of medium length , to dinners out and finally to foreign films , in one of which he had gone so far as to hold her hand . He had even invited her to his apartment once , for afternoon tea . Ainsley said later with several vigorous oaths that he had been on this occasion a model of propriety . Since by her own admission she did n't drink , she could not even pretend to permit him to get her drunk . In conversation he treated her as though she was a little girl , patiently explaining things to her and impressing her with stories about the television studio and assuring her that his interest in her was strictly that of a well - wishing older friend until she wanted to scream . And she could n't even talk back : it was necessary for her mind to appear as vacant as her face . Her hands were tied . She had constructed her image and now she had to maintain it.^ To make any advances herself , or to let slip a flicker of anything resembling intelligence , would have been so out of character as to give her dumb - show irrevocably away . So she had been stewing and fussing in private , suffering Len 's overly - subtle manoeuvrings with suppressed impatience and watching the all - important calendar days slide uneventfully by . "
51005	51009	51010	51010	I	0	" Ainsley said , "
51042	51058	51036	51036	I	0	" She frowned , as much as she was able to with her embryonic eyebrows . "
51063	51080	51061	51061	...	1041	" Marian asked , beginning to see why Ainsley had been annoyed at her unexpected return . "
51096	51101	51082	51082	he	1042	" Ainsley said petulantly . "
51136	51137	51124	51124	I	0	" "
51146	51156	51142	51142	I	0	" Marian said , her voice heavy with disapproval . "
51230	51231	51213	51213	I	0	" "
51239	51255	51213	51213	I	0	" Marian sighed . Censure was , at this point , none of her business . "
51265	51286	51213	51213	I	0	" Ainsley 's face brightened . Her main objective had been gained ; the rest of the details were secondary . "
51318	51493	51494	51494	I	0	" Marian considered . Previously , in some area of time she could not at the moment remember clearly , she would have been able to ; it would n't have mattered if he had got peeved . But these days , and especially after their conversation in the afternoon , it would not be a good idea . No matter how unobtrustive she made herself with a book in the living room , he would silently accuse her of being overpossessive , or of being jealous and interfering about his work . Even if she explained the real situation . And she did n't want to do that : though Peter had seen almost nothing of Len since the first evening , having exchanged the free - bachelor image for the mature - fiance one and adjusted his responses and acquaintances accordingly , there would still be a kind of clan - loyalty that might cause trouble , if not for Ainsley , at least for her . It would give him ammunition . "
51502	51506	51507	51507	He	1046	" she said . "
51513	51551	51507	51507	He	1046	" There was really no place she could go . Clara 's was out . It was getting too cold for sitting in parks or for prolonged walking . She might call one of the office virgins .... "
51558	51570	51552	51552	I	0	" she said at last . 120 Ainsley smiled with relief . "
51573	51598	51552	51552	I	0	" she said , and went into her bedroom to finish dressing . She stuck her head out a few minutes later to ask , "
51624	51625	51619	51619	you	1047	" "
51631	51811	51619	51619	you	1047	" Marian said . The scotch was mutually owned . Ainsley , she knew , would pay her back out of the next bottle . Even if she forgot to , a half - bottle of scotch would be a small enough sacrifice to get the thing decisively over and done with . This vicariously nervewracking delay and shilly - shally had gone on far too long . She remained in the kitchen , leaning against the counter and gazing with pensive interest into the sink , which contained four glasses partly filled with opaque water , a fragment of eggshell , and a pot that had recently been used for cooking macaroni and cheese . She decided not to wash the dishes , but as a token gesture of cleanliness she picked out the eggshell and put it in the garbage . She disliked remnants . When Ainsley reappeared , in a blouse and jumper outfit set off by earrings in the shape of tiny daisies and an extra good eye - job , Marian said to her , "
51836	51851	51852	51852	I	0	" Even if she expects me to sleep in the gutter , she thought . "
51864	51870	51852	51852	I	0	" Ainsley said with determination . "
51915	51929	51852	51852	I	0	" Marian 's mind selected the most ominous word . Any closed doors . "
51933	51937	51938	51938	I	0	" she said , "
51947	51948	51938	51938	I	0	" "
51955	51960	51938	51938	I	0	" Ainsley said reasonably , "
51995	51996	51993	51993	I	0	" "
52003	52016	51999	51999	I	0	" said Marian . She was beginning to feel homeless and dispossessed . "
52039	52040	51999	51999	I	0	" "
52045	52049	51999	51999	I	0	" said Ainsley , "
52071	52073	52060	52060	I	0	" 121 "
52077	52122	52060	52060	I	0	" Marian asked . She knew Ainsley collected things - among the objects covering the floor of her room were several photographs , some letters , and a half - dozen dried out flowers - but did n't know she had collected any ties . "
52129	52152	52124	52124	his	1057	" said Ainsley . Marian had a disturbing vision of a trophy room with stuffed and antlered heads nailed to the walls . "
52160	52373	52124	52124	his	1057	" she asked . Leonard , after all , was supposed to be her friend . She pondered the situation while she ate her t.v . dinner and drank her tea in solitude , Ainsley having departed , and while she dawdled around the apartment waiting for it to be the right time for the late show . All the way to the nearest movie theatre district she was still pondering it . She had felt for some time , in one of the smaller and more obscure crevices of her mind , that she ought to do something to warn Len , but she did n't know what , or , more importantly , why . She knew he would not readily believe that Ainsley , who seemed as young and inexperienced as a button mushroom , was in reality a scheming superfemale carrying out a foul plot against him , using him in effect as an inexpensive substitute for artificial insemination with a devastating lack of concern for his individuality . And there was no convincing evidence as yet ; Ainsley had been most discreet . Marian had thought several times of calling him up in the middle of the night with a nylon stocking over the telephone mouthpiece and whispering "
52376	52860	52124	52124	his	1057	" ; but that would do no good . He would never guess what he was supposed to beware of . Anonymous letters . . . he 'd think it was some crank ; or a jealous former girlfriend trying to foil his own fiendish plans , which would only make his pursuit more eager . Besides , ever since she had become engaged there had been a tacit agreement with Ainsley : neither was to interfere with the other 's strategy , though it was apparent that each disapproved of the other 's course of action on moral grounds . If she said anything to Len she knew that Ainsley would be perfectly capable of carrying out a successful , or at any rate an unsettling , counter - attack . No , Len must be abandoned to his fate , which he would no doubt embrace with glee . Marian was further confused by the fact that she did n't exactly know whether an early Christian was being thrown 122 to the lions , or an early lion to the Christians . Was she , as Ainsley had asked her during one of their Sunday discussions , on the side of the Creative Life Force , or was n't she ? There was also the lady down below to be considered . Even if she was n't peering out a window or standing in ambush behind one of the velvet curtains when Leonard arrived , she would almost certainly be aware that a pair of masculine feet had ascended the stairs ; and in her mind , that despotic empire where the proprieties had the rigidity and force of the law of gravity , what went up must come down , preferably before eleven - thirty at night . Though she had never said so : it was merely something one took into account . Marian hoped Ainsley would have the sense either to get him over with and get him out before twelve at the latest , or , if the worst came to the worst , to keep him there , and keep him quiet , all night ; what they would do with him the next morning , in that case , she was not sure . He would probably have to be smuggled out in the laundry bag . Even if he was in any condition to walk by himself . Oh , well ; they could always find another apartment . But she hated scenes . Marian got off the subway at the station near the laundromat . There were two movie - theatres close by , across the street from each other . She inspected them . One was offering a foreign film with subtitles , advertised outside by black - and - white fuzzy reproductions of ecstatic newspaper reviews and much use of the words "
52862	52864	52124	52124	his	1057	" and "
52866	53765	52124	52124	his	1057	" . It had won several awards . The other had a low - budget American Western and technicolour posters of horsemen and dying Indians . In her present state she did not feel like writhing through intensities and pauses and long artistic closeups of expressively - twitched skin - pores . She was looking only for warmth , shelter , and something resembling oblivion , so she chose the Western . When she groped her way to a seat in the half - empty theatre the movie had already begun . She slouched her body down , resting her head on the back of the seat and her knees against the seat in front and half - closing her eyes . Not a lady - like position , but nobody could see in the dark ; and the seats on either side of her were empty . She had made sure of that : she did n't want any trouble with furtive old 123 men . She recalled such encounters from early school days , before she had learned about movie theatres . Hands squeezing against knees and similar bits of shuffling pathos , although not frightening ( one should just move quietly away ) , were painfully embarrassing to her simply because they were sincere . The attempt at contact , even slight contact , was crucial for the fumblers in the dark . The coloured pictures succeeded each other in front of her : gigantic stetsoned men stretched across the screen on their even more gigantic horses , trees and cactus - plants rose in the foreground or faded in the background as the landscape flowed along ; smoke and dust and galloping . She did n't attempt to decide what the cryptic speeches meant or to follow the plot . She knew there must be bad people who were trying to do something evil and good people who were trying to stop them , probably by getting to the money first ( as well as Indians who were numerous as buffalo and fair game for everyone ) , but it did n't matter to her which of these moral qualities was incarnate in any given figure presented to her . At least it was n't one of the new Westerns in which people had psychoses . She amused herself by concentrating on the secondary actors , the bit players , wondering what they did in their no doubt copious spare time and whether any of them still had illusions of future stardom . It was night , the purplish - blue translucent night that descends only on the technicolour screen . Someone was sneaking through a meadow towards someone else ; all was quiet except for the rustling of the grass and the chirping of several mechanical crickets . Close beside her , to the left , she heard a small cracking noise , then the sound of something hard hitting the floor . A gun went off , there was a struggle , and it was day . She heard the cracking noise again . She turned her head to the left . In the faint reflection from the glare of sunlight on the screen she could barely make out who was sitting beside her , two places away . It was the man from the laundromat . He was slumped in the seat , staring glassily in front of him . Every half - minute or so he would lift his hand to his mouth from a bag he was holding in his other hand , and there would be the small crack and then the sound from the floor . He must be eating something with shells , but they were n't peanuts . That would 124 make a softer noise . She studied his dim profile , the nose and one eye and the shadowed hunch of one shoulder . She turned her head to the front again and tried to concentrate all her attention on the screen . Although she found herself being glad that he had suddenly materilized in that seat , it was an irrational gladness : she did n't intend to speak to him , in fact she was hoping very much that he had not seen her , would not see her sitting alone there in the movie - theatre . He seemed entranced by the screen , almost totally absorbed in it , and in whatever he was eating - what could possibly make that exasperating thin cracking sound ? - and he might not notice her if she kept quite still . But she had the disquieting sense that he knew perfectly well who she was and had been aware of her presence for some time before she had recognized his . She gazed at the vast featureless expanse of prairie before her . At her side the cracking went on , irritatingly regular . They were fording a river , men and horses together and one blonde woman in a dishevelled dress , when she noticed a peculiar sensation in her left hand . It wanted to reach across and touch him on the shoulder . JDtsj^ill seemed independent of her own : surely she herself wanted nothing of the kind . She made its ringers grip the arm of her seat . "
53771	53777	53778	53778	he	1058	" she admonished it silently , "
53782	53936	53778	53778	he	1058	" But she was also afraid , now that she was n't looking at him any more , that if she did reach across , her hand would encounter only darkness and emptiness or the plush surface of movie - theatre upholstery . The sound - track exploded , spattering the air with yelps and whoops , as a band of Indians swept from their hiding - place for the attack . After they had been demolished and listening was possible again she could no longer hear the small clock - like sound he had been making . She jerked her head round to the side : nobody . Well , he had gone then , or perhaps he had never been there in the first place ; or maybe it had been somebody else . On the screen a gargantuan cowboy was pressing his lips chastely to those of the blonde woman . "
53944	53977	53937	53937	Hank	122	" she was whispering . Shortly there would be a sunset . Then , so close to her ear that she could feel the breath stirring her hair , a voice spoke . "
53981	53985	53937	53937	Hank	122	" it said . "
53994	53998	53987	53987	Her	1059	" Pumpkin seeds , "
54004	54011	53987	53987	Her	1059	" of course , why not ? "
54066	54074	54075	54075	she	1059	" So I 'm finally going mad , "
54078	54096	54075	54075	she	1059	" like everybody else . What a nuisance . Though I suppose it will be a change . "
54315	54319	54320	54320	she	1059	" Miss McAlpin , "
54327	54399	54320	54320	she	1059	" I have been so upset . I 'm sure I heard a - some man went upstairs earlier this evening with Miss Tewce , and I 'm positive I have n't heard him come down yet . Of course , I do n't mean to imply that - I know that you are both very nice girls , but still , the child .... ' Marian looked at her watch . "
54407	54412	54402	54402	I	0	" she said doubtfully , "
54450	54451	54442	54442	Ainsley	52	" "
54482	54497	54475	54475	I	0	" The mangy old eavesdropper , she 's perfectly avid , Marian 126 thought . "
54506	54511	54499	54499	she	1069	" she said cheerfully . "
54542	54700	54529	54529	I	0	" She smiled with what she intended to be a reassuring efficiency , and escaped up the stairs . Ainsley is a whited sepulchre , she thought as she climbed , and I 've just applied another coat of whitewash . But remember the mote in thy neighbour 's eye and the beam in thine own , etcetera . How on earth are we going to convey him , whatever is left of him , down past that old vulture in the morning ? On the kitchen table she found the scotch bottle , three - quarters empty . A tie with green and blue stripes was dangling victoriously on the closed door of her own room . That meant she 'd have to clear some place that could be slept in , more or less , from the tangled crow's - nest of sheets , clothing , blankets and paperback books that was Ainsley 's bed . "
54704	54968	54529	54529	I	0	" she said to herself as she flung off her coat . At four - thirty the next day Marian was walking along a hospital corridor searching for the right room . She had skipped her lunchhour , substituting a cheese - and - lettuce sandwich - a slice of plastic cheese between two pieces of solidified bubble - bath with several flaps of pallid greenery , brought in a cardboard carton by the restaurant take - out - order boy - for real food , so that she could leave the office an hour early , and had already spent half - an - hour buying the roses and getting to the hospital . Now she had only thirty minutes of visiting time in which to talk with Clara ; she wondered whether they would be able to produce , between them , thirty minutes ' worth of conversation . The doors of the rooms were standing open , and she had to pause in front of them and step almost into the rooms to read the numbers . From within each came the high - pitched bibblebobble of T.E.W.—5 I27 women talking together . At last she reached the right number , close to the end of the corridor . Clara was lying diaphanously on a high white hospital bed , its raised back propping her in a half - sitting position . She was wearing a flannelette hospital gown . Her body under the sheet looked to Marian unnaturally thin ; her pale hair was falling loosely over her shoulders . "
54972	54976	54529	54529	I	0	" she said . "
54989	55021	54981	54983	the old mum	1071	" Marian thrust her flowers forward in place of the guilty apologetic remark she should have made . Clara 's fragile fingers unwrapped the cornucopia of green paper from around them . "
55026	55030	55031	55031	I	0	" she said . "
55065	55118	55047	55047	She	1072	" When selecting them , Marian had been uncertain whether to get deep red ones , salmon pink , or white ; she was a little sorry now that she had chosen the white . In some ways they went almost too well with Clara ; in other ways not at all . "
55125	55187	55047	55047	She	1072	" Clara said in a low voice . There were three other women in the room and private conversation was obviously difficult . When Marian had pulled the heavy canvas curtains that were attached by rings to a curved metal rod suspended like a large oval halo above the bed and had sat down on the visitor 's chair she asked , "
55195	55196	55192	55192	you	1074	" "
55325	55340	55341	55341	You	1073	" She picked up one of the white roses , and sniffed at it . "
55349	55431	55341	55341	You	1073	" Marian wondered how she could be so casual about it , as if she 128 was recommending a handy trick for making fluffier pie - crust or a new detergent . Of course it was something she had always planned to do , eventually ; and Peter had begun to make remarks with paternal undertones . But in this room with these white - sheeted outstretched women the possibility was suddenly much too close . And then there was Ainsley . "
55437	55443	55341	55341	You	1073	" she said , smiling . "
55451	55456	55341	55341	You	1073	" Clara said smugly , "
55547	55602	55542	55542	I	0	" She hitched herself up a little against the pillows . Marian sat and smiled at her . She could n't think of anything to say in reply . More and more , Clara 's life seemed cut off from her , set apart , something she could only gaze at through a window . "
55611	55638	55605	55605	you	1073	" she asked , repressing a desire to shout , not quite sure whether Clara would be able to hear her through the glass . , - "
55728	55845	55715	55715	Joe	82	" Marian stared at the wall above Clara 's head , thinking that it was painted the same colour as the office . She almost expected to hear the sound of typewriters from beyond the curtains , but instead there were only the murmuring voices of the three other women and their visitors . When she came in she had noticed that one of them , the young one in the pink - lace bedjacket , had been sitting up working at a paint - by - numbers picture . Maybe she should have brought Clara something to do , instead of just flowers : it must be very tiresome lying around like that all day . "
55857	55891	55847	55847	you	1086	" she asked , thinking as she did so how much she was sounding like the kind of 129 ladies'-club member who makes a part - time career out of visiting the sick . "
55923	55931	55934	55936	those other women	1088	" she said in a lower voice , "
56100	56101	56095	56095	women	262	" "
56113	56240	56110	56110	I	0	" Marian said . Clara was talking a lot more , and a lot more quickly , than she usually did , and Marian found herself being surprised . During the later , more vegetable stage of Clara 's pregnancy she had tended to forget that Clara had a mind at all or any perceptive faculties above the merely sentient and sponge - like , since she had spent most of her time being absorbed in , or absorbed by , her tuberous abdomen . To have her observing , commenting like this , was a slight shock . It might be some kind of reaction , but it certainly was n't hysteria : she seemed thoroughly in control . Something to do with hormones maybe . "
56248	56253	56255	56255	he	82	" Clara said happily . "
56441	56442	56422	56422	I	0	" "
56456	56460	56444	56444	you	0	" Marian said . "
56464	56465	56444	56444	you	0	" "
56470	56489	56444	56444	you	0	" Clara said , smiling serenely . She was twirling one of the white roses between her fingers . "
56499	56517	56492	56492	I	0	" she said , turning herself on the bed so she was facing more directly towards Marian . "
56551	56555	56549	56549	Peter	53	" Marian said , "
56581	56582	56577	56577	you	0	" "
56665	56666	56659	56659	he	53	" "
56670	56686	56659	56659	he	53	" asked Marian . She did n't know what it was but it sounded perverted . "
56711	56715	56716	56716	I	0	" she said , "
56727	56847	56719	56719	he	53	" Marian did n't know what to say . She found Clara 's attitude towards Joe both complacent and embarrassing : it was sentimental , like the love stories in the back numbers of women 's magazines . Also she felt Clara was trying to give her some kind of oblique advice , and this was even more embarrassing . Poor Clara , she was the last person whose advice would be worth anything . Look at thejness she had blundered into : three children at her age . Peter and she were going into it with far fewer illusions . If Clara had slept with Joe before marriage she would have been much better able to cope afterwards . "
56856	56872	56850	56850	Joe	82	" she said generously . 131 Clara gave a snort of laughter , then winced . "
56924	56975	56911	56911	you	1105	" Her voice was perfectly good - natured . Marian started to protest , thinking it was unfair of Clara to force the conversation out into the open like that ; but a nurse popped her head through the doorway long enough to announce that the visiting time was up . "
56984	56992	56993	56993	you	1105	" Clara said as Marian was leaving , "
57060	57061	57063	57063	I	0	" "
57068	57322	57063	57063	I	0	" said Marian . It struck her as she went out the door that there had been something in Clara 's manner , especially in the slightly worried twist of her eyebrows once or twice , that had expressed concern ; but concern about what , exactly , she did n't know and could n't stop to puzzle over . She had the sense of having escaped , as if from a culvert or cave . She was glad she was n't Clara . Now there was the rest of the day to unravel . She would eat quickly at the nearest restaurant she could find and by the time she was finished the traffic would have cleared somewhat , and she could rush home and grab some laundry . What on earth did she have that was fit to take ? Perhaps a couple of blouses . She wondered whether a pleated skirt would do , that would keep him busy and she had one that needed pressing , but on second thought it was the wrong sort of thing , and surely too complicated anyway . The hours before her were going to be , she felt , as convoluted as that hour in the afternoon during which Peter had called to arrange dinner and they had discussed at length - too great a length , she was afraid - where they were going to eat ; and then after all that she had had to call him back and say , "
57346	57409	57412	57412	Duncan	54	" He had been peevish , but he 132 could n't say much about it because he had just finished doing the same thing to her the day before . There had been a difference , of course , in what had come up . In her case it had been another telephone call . The voice at the other end had said "
57414	57415	57412	57412	Duncan	54	" "
57418	57419	57420	57424	The guy at the laundromat	1113	" "
57426	57427	57420	57424	The guy at the laundromat	1113	" "
57432	57447	57420	57424	The guy at the laundromat	1113	" Now she recognized the voice , though it sounded more nervous than usual . "
57471	57472	57475	57475	I	0	" "
57479	57513	57475	57475	I	0	" she said , glancing at the clock and then at the open door of Mrs. Bogue 's cubicle . She had already spent far too much time on the phone that afternoon . "
57566	57567	57548	57548	I	0	" "
57570	57582	57548	57548	I	0	" she said , to fill up the pause that followed . "
57589	57637	57548	57548	I	0	" Marian wondered whether the switchboard girl downstairs was listening in on the conversation , as she had been known to do , and if so , what she was thinking about it ; she must have realized by now that it was not a business call . "
57644	57653	57638	57642	Mr. . . . Duncan	54	" she said in her most official voice , "
57683	57684	57675	57675	I	0	" "
57687	57745	57675	57675	I	0	" he said . He sounded discouraged , but he made no attempt to clarify the situation . She pictured him at the other end of the line , morose , holloweyed , waiting for the sound of her voice . She had no idea why he had called . Perf^iJiej^edecLher , needed to talk to her . "
57755	57760	57747	57747	I	0	" she said encouragingly . "
57766	57767	57747	57747	I	0	" "
57770	57774	57747	57747	I	0	" he said , "
57845	57856	57830	57830	I	0	" Mrs. Bogue 's eye was now definitely upon her . "
57862	58000	57830	57830	I	0	" she said crisply . Then she suddenly decided that it would be , for some as yet unexamined reason , disastrous if this man were to encounter either Peter or Ainsley . Besides , who could tell what variety of turmoil had broken loose after she had tiptoed out of the house that morning , leaving Len still caught in the toils of vice behind the door ornamented with his own tie ? She had n't heard from Ainsley all day , which might be either a good or an evil omen . And even if Len had managed to escape safely , the wrath of the lady down below , foiled of its proper object , might very well descend on the head of the harmless ironer as a representative of the whole male species . "
58012	58016	58002	58002	I	0	" she said . "
58062	58063	58054	58054	I	0	" "
58074	58103	58054	58054	I	0	" she said , trying both to reassure him and to sound , for the benefit of the office , as though she was making a dentist appointment . "
58107	58527	58054	58054	I	0	" She realized as soon as she had hung up that this would mean postponing dinner with Peter yet again ; but then she could see him any night . The other thing was an emergency . By the time she had got matters straightened out with Peter she had felt as though she had been trying to unsnarl herself from all the telephone lines in the city . They were prehensile , they were like snakes , they had a way of coiling back on you and getting you all wrapped up . A nurse was coming towards her , pushing a rubber - wheeled wagon loaded with trays of food . Although her mind was occupied with other things , Marian 's eyes registered the white shape and found it out of place . She stopped and looked around . Wherever else she was going it was not towards the main exit . She had been so involved in the threads of her own plans and reflections that she must have got off the elevator on the wrong floor . She was in a corridor exactly similar to the one she had just come from , except 134 that all the room - doors were closed . She looked for a number : 273 . Well , that was simple : she had got ofFa floor too soon . She turned and walked back , trying to remember where the elevator was supposed to be ; she seemed to recall having gone around several corners . The nurse had disappeared . Coming towards her now from the far end of the hallway was a figure , a man wearing a green smock , with a white mask over the lower part of his face . She was aware for the first time of the hospital smell , antiseptic , severe . It must be one of the doctors . She could see now that he had a thin black thing , a stethoscope , around his neck . As he came nearer she looked at him more closely . In spite of the mask there was something familiar about him ; it bothered her that she could not tell what it was . But he passed her , staring straight ahead , his eyes expressionless , and opened one of the doors to the right and went in . When he turned she could see that he had a bald spot on the back of his head . "
58541	58897	58054	58054	I	0	" she said to herself . She was relieved . 16 She remembered the way to his apartment perfectly , although she could n't recall either the number or the street name . She had n't been in that district for a long time , in fact ever since the day of the beer interviews . She took the right directions and turnings almost automatically , as though she was trailing somebody by an instinct that was connected not with sight or smell but with a vaguer sense that had to do with locations . But it was n't a complicated route : just across the baseball park , up the asphalt ramp and along a couple of blocks ; though the way seemed longer now that she was walking in a darkness illuminated only by the dim street lamps rather than the former searing light of the sun . She walked T.B.W.—5 * I3j ; quickly : already her legs were cold . The grass on the baseball park had been grey with frost . The few times she had thought about the apartment , in idle moments at the office when she had had nothing but a blank sheet of paper in front of her or at other times when she was bending to pick some piece of clutter off the floor , she had never given it any specific place in the city . She had an image in her mind of the inside , the appearance of the rooms , but not of the building itself . Now it was disconcerting to have the street produce it , square and ordinary and anonymous , more or less exactly where it had been before . She pushed the buzzer of Number Six and slipped through the inside glass door as soon as the mechanism started its chain - saw noise . Duncan opened the door part - way . He stared at her suspiciously ; in the semi - darkness his eyes gleamed behind his hair . He had a cigarette stub in his mouth , burning dangerously close to his lips . "
58902	58933	58054	58054	I	0	" he asked . Mutely she held towards him the small cloth bundle she had been carrying under her arm , and he stepped aside to let her come in . "
58940	58989	58054	58054	I	0	" he said , undoing the clothes . There were only two white cotton blouses , recently washed , a pillowcase , and a few guest towels embroidered with flowers , donated by a greataunt , that were wrinkled from lying underneath everything else on the linen shelf . "
58994	58998	58990	58990	I	0	" she said , "
59006	59007	59003	59003	I	0	" "
59016	59056	59003	59003	I	0	" he said grudgingly . He turned and walked towards his bedroom . Marian was n't certain whether she was supposed to follow him or whether he expected her to go away now that she had made the delivery . "
59061	59109	59113	59113	you	1125	" she asked , hoping he would n't consider it an invasion of privacy . She did n't feel like going back to her own apartment right away . There would be nothing to do and she had , after all , sacrificed an evening with Peter . "
59125	59409	59113	59113	you	1125	" She made her way towards the hall . The living room had not been altered since her former visit , except that there were if possible 136 more stray papers lying about . The three chairs were still in the same positions ; a slab of board was leaning against an arm of the red plush one . Only one of the lamps , the one by the blue chair , was turned on . Marian inferred that both of the room - mates were out . Duncan 's room too was much the same as she remembered it . The ironing - board was nearer the centre of the room and the chessmen had been set up in their two opposing rows ; the blackand - white chequered board was resting now on top of a stack of books . On the bed were several freshly - ironed white shirts on coathangers . Duncan hung them up in the closet before going over to plug in the iron . Marian took off her coat and sat down on the bed . He threw his cigarette into one of the crowded ashtrays on the floor , waited for the iron to heat , testing it at intervals on the board , and then began to iron one of the blouses , with slow concentration and systematic attention to collar corners . Marian watched him silently ; he obviously did n't want to be interrupted . She found it strange to see someone else ironing her clothes . Ainsley had given her a peculiar look when she had come out of her bedroom with her coat on and the bundle under her arm . "
59417	59432	59412	59412	you	1126	" she had asked . It was too small a lot for the laundromat . "
59438	59439	59412	59412	you	1126	" "
59448	59449	59450	59450	He	53	" "
59462	59533	59458	59458	I	0	" She had plunged down the stairs then , not wishing to explain anything at all about Duncan or even to reveal his existence . She felt it might upset the balance of power . But Ainsley had no time at the moment for anything more than a tepid curiosity : she was too elated by the probable success of her own campaign , and also by what she had called "
59538	59567	59572	59572	you	0	" . Marian had asked , when she had reached the apartment and had found Ainsley in the living room with a paperback on Baby and Child Care , "
59583	59587	59572	59572	you	0	" Ainsley laughed . "
59593	59597	59598	59598	I	0	" she said . "
59648	59649	59650	59650	She	1131	" "
59661	59665	59666	59666	She	1131	" Marian interjected . "
59675	59676	59666	59666	She	1131	" "
59798	59807	59789	59789	he	87	" She smiled with her small pink mouth . "
59814	59815	59789	59789	he	87	" "
59893	59903	59848	59848	he	87	" she said , hugging herself with both arms , "
59919	59920	59931	59931	you	52	" "
59925	59929	59931	59931	you	52	" Marian said , "
59937	60267	59931	59931	you	52	" Thinking back on it , she found something ominous about the fact that the lady down below had gone out . It was n't like her at all . She 'd be much more likely to lurk behind the piano or the velvet curtains while they were creeping down the stairs and spring out upon them just as they had reached the threshold of safety . He was starting on the second blouse . He seemed to be unaware of everything but the wrinkled white material spread on the board in front of him , poring over it as though it was an ancient and very fragile manuscript that he could n't quite translate . Before , she had thought of him as being short , perhaps because of the shrunken child's - face , or because she had mostly seen him sitting down ; but now she thought , actually he would be quite tall if he did n't slouch like that . 138 As she sat watching him she recognized in herself a desire to say something to him , to intrude , to break through the white cloth surface of his absorption : she did not like being so totally closed out . To avoid the emotion she picked up her purse and went into the bathroom , intending to comb her hair , not because it needed combing but as what Ainsley called a substitution - activity ; like a squirrel scratching itself when confronted by hazardous or unobtainable breadcrumbs . She wanted to talk to him , but talking to him now , she thought , might cancel out any therapeutic effects the ironing was having . The bathroom was ordinary enough . Damp towels were mounded on the racks and a clutter of shaving things and men 's cosmetics covered the various porcelain ledges and surfaces . But the mirror over the basin liad been broken . There were only a tew jagged "
60351	60363	60364	60364	he	1137	" I suppose you 're wondering what happened to the mirror , "
60367	60371	60364	60364	he	1137	" Well . .. "
60372	60386	60341	60341	He	1137	" I smashed it . Last week . With the frying - pan . "
60387	60390	60391	60391	she	1135	" Oh , "
60394	60446	60447	60447	he	1137	" I got tired of being afraid I 'd walk in there some morning and would n't be able to see my own reflection in it . So I went and grabbed the frying - pan out of the kitchen and gave it a whack . They both got very upset , "
60451	60632	60447	60447	he	1137	" particularly Trevor , he was cooking an omelette at the time and I guess I sort of ruined it . Got it all full of broken glass . But I do n't really see why it should disturb them , it was a perfectly understandable symbolic narcissistic gesture , andjt^wasn't a good mirror anyway . But they 've been jittery ever since . Especially Trevor , subconsciously he thinks he 's my mother ; it 's rather hard on him . It does n't bother me that much , I 'm used to it , I 've been running away from * 39 understudy mothers ever since I can remember , there 's a whole herd of them behind me trying to catch up and rescue me , god knows what from , and give me warmth and comfort and nourishment and make me quit smoking , that 's what you get for being an orphan . And they 're quoting things at me : Trevor quotes T. S. Eliot these days and Fish quotes the Oxford English Dictionary . "
60633	60640	60641	60641	Marian	112	" How do you shave then ? "
60680	60683	60672	60672	She	112	" What ? "
60684	60691	60657	60657	She	112	" I mean with no mirror . "
60692	60695	60696	60696	he	1139	" Oh , "
60733	60751	60728	60728	I	0	" He seemed to lose interest in the subject , and ironed in silence for a minute . "
60756	60771	60772	60772	I	0	" he said at last ; he was doing one of the guest towels . "
60783	60784	60785	60785	I	0	" "
60793	60806	60788	60788	We	1140	" He folded the towel , then looked up at her gloomily . "
60814	60815	60809	60809	you	112	" "
60821	60826	60809	60809	you	112	" she answered cautiously . "
60937	60938	60933	60933	you	1146	" "
60942	60997	60940	60940	I	0	" She could n't tell whether or not he was being serious ; his expression revealed nothing . Perhaps this was another labyrinth of words , and if she said the wrong thing , took the wrong turning , she would suddenly find herself face to face with something she could not cope with . "
61010	61034	61038	61039	a changeling	1147	" - he waved the iron in the air for emphasis , watching the movement of his hand 140 as he did so - "
61066	61076	61062	61062	they	1149	" He closed his J eyes , smiling faintly . "
61104	61148	61077	61077	They	1149	" * He opened his eyes and began to iron again , but his attention had ^ wandered away from the ironing - board . He brought the iron too f- close to his other hand , and gave a yelp of pain . "
61151	61213	61077	61077	They	1149	" he said . ^ He set the iron down and stuck his finger in his mouth . /^Marian 's first impulse was to go over and see whether it was a ) fjbad burn , and suggest remedies , butter or baking - soda ; but she / decided against it . Instead she sat unmoving and said nothing . * "
61214	61215	61216	61216	He	1150	" "
61231	61240	61241	61241	he	1150	" Are n't you going to comfort me ? "
61244	61250	61251	61251	she	1151	" I do n't think , "
61254	61261	61251	61251	she	1151	" that it 's really needed . "
61262	61272	61273	61273	he	1150	" You 're right ; I enjoy it though , "
61277	61283	61273	61273	he	1150	" And it does hurt . "
61311	61380	61308	61308	he	1150	" That was a vigorous session , thanks for the clothes , but it was n't really enough . I 'll have to think of something else to do with the rest of the tension . I 'm not a chronic ironer you know , I 'm not hooked , it 's not one of the habits I ought to kick , but I go on these binges . "
61399	61638	61381	61381	He	1150	" This one started the day before yesterday when I dropped my term - paper in a puddle on the kitchen floor and I had to dry it out and iron it . It was all typed and I could n't face typing it over again , plowing through all that verbiage , I 'd start wanting to change everything . It came out okay , nothing blurred , but you could tell it had been ironed , I scorched one of the pages . But they ca n't reasonably object , it would sound pretty silly to say , ' We ca n't accept a term - paper that 's been ironed . ' So I turned it in and then of course I had to get rid of all that frenzy , so I ironed everything in the house that was clean . Then I had to go to the laundromat and wash some dirty things , that 's why I was sitting in that wretched movie , I was waiting for the clothes to get done . I got bored watching them churning around in there , that 's a bad sign , if I get bored with 141 the laundromat even , what the hell am I going to do when I get bored with everything else ? Then I ironed all the things I 'd washed , and then I 'd run out . "
61639	61646	61647	61647	Marian	112	" And then you phoned me , "
61677	61755	61655	61655	he	1152	" Oh . You . Yes . Then I phoned you . At least , I phoned your company . I remembered the name , I guess it was the switchboard girl I got , and I sort of described you to whoever it was for a while , I said you did n't look like the usual kind of interviewer ; and then they figured out who you were . You never told me your name . "
61820	61829	61830	61830	she	112	" Why do you like ironing so much ? "
61833	61857	61858	61858	He	1154	" I mean , apart from relieving tension and all that ; but why ironing ? Instead of maybe bowling , for instance ? "
61872	61879	61880	61880	he	1154	" Ironing 's nice and simple , "
61883	61954	61880	61880	he	1154	" I get all tangled up in words when I 'm putting together those interminable papers , I 'm on another one by the way , ' Sado - Masochistic Patterns in Trollope , ' and ironing - well , you straighten things out and get them flat . God knows it is n't because I 'm neat and tidy ; but there 's something about a flat surface . ... "
61966	61988	61989	61989	he	1154	" Why do n't you let me touch up that blouse for you a bit while the iron 's still hot ? "
61992	62012	61989	61989	he	1154	" I 'll just do the sleeves and the collar . It looks like you missed a few places . "
62013	62022	62033	62033	He	1154	" You mean the one I have on ? "
62023	62029	62030	62030	he	1154	" That 's the one , "
62045	62065	62066	62066	He	1154	" Here , you can wear my dressing - gown . Do n't worry , I wo n't peek . "
62128	62139	62104	62104	he	1154	" No thank 142 you , I 'd rather not , "
62197	62203	62204	62204	she	112	" Here you are then , "
62274	62277	62278	62278	he	1154	" There , "
62281	62285	62278	62278	he	1154	" all done . "
62354	62357	62358	62358	he	1154	" God , "
62361	62459	62358	62358	he	1154	" all these distractions . How does one go on ? It 's like term - papers , you produce all that stuff and nothing is ever done with it , you just get a grade for it and heave it in the trash , you know that some other poor comma - counter is going to come along the year after you and have to do the same thing over again , it 's a treadmill , even ironing , you iron the damn things and then you wear them and they get all wrinkled again . "
62460	62475	62476	62476	Marian	112	" Well , and then you can iron them again , ca n't you ? "
62480	62493	62476	62476	Marian	112	" If they stayed neat you would n't have anything to do . "
62494	62505	62506	62506	he	1154	" Maybe I 'd do something worthwhile for a change , "
62515	62855	62856	62856	Marian	112	" Production - consumption . You begin to wonder whether it is n't just a question of making one kind of garbage into another kind . The human mind was the last thing to be commercialized but they 're doing a good job of it now ; what is the difference between the library stacks and one of those used - car graveyards ? What bothers me though is that none of it is ever final ; you ca n't ever finish anything . I have this great plan for permanent leaves on trees , it 's a waste for them having to produce a new lot each year ; and come to think of it there 's no reason at all 143 why they have to be green , either ; I 'd have them white . Black trunks and white leaves . I can hardly wait till it snows , this city in the summer has altogether too much vegetation , it 's stifling , and then it all falls off and lies around in the gutters . The thing I like about the place I came from , it 's a mining town , there is n't much of anything in it but at least it has no vegetation . A lot of people would n't like it . It 's the smelting plants that do it , tall smokestacks reaching up into the sky and the smoke glows red at night , and the chemical fumes have burnt the trees for miles around , it 's barren , nothing but the barren rock , even grass wo n't grow on most of it , and there are the slag - heaps too ; where the water collects on the rock it 's a yellowish - brown from the chemicals . Nothing would grow there even if you planted it , I used to go out of the town and sit on the rocks , about this time of year , waiting for the snow . ... "
62979	62982	62983	62983	he	1156	" Hey , "
62991	63001	62983	62983	he	1156	" you look sort of like me in that . "
63154	63165	63166	63166	she	112	" I think I ought to tell you 144 something , "
63170	63175	63166	63166	she	112	" I 'm engaged . "
63210	63218	63219	63219	he	1156	" That 's your problem , then , "
63222	63259	63219	63219	he	1156	" It 's like me telling you I got an A on my Pre - Raphaelite Pornography paper - interesting , but it does n't have much of anything to do with anything . Does it ? "
63260	63267	63268	63268	she	112	" Well , but it does , "
63281	63298	63268	63268	she	112	" I 'm going to get married , you know . I should n't be here . "
63299	63300	63219	63219	he	1156	" "
63306	63310	63302	63302	you	112	" He smiled . "
63330	63335	63336	63336	I	0	" he said earnestly , "
63367	63376	63364	63365	somebody else	576	" He kissed the end of her nose . "
63386	63410	63377	63377	You	112	" Marian wondered whether her feelings ought to be hurt , but decided that they were n't : instead she was faintly relieved . "
63422	63426	63414	63414	you	0	" she said . "
63446	63478	63440	63440	I	0	" He reached up over her head and turned off the light . Not very much later the front door was opened and closed , admitting a number of heavy footsteps . "
63483	63494	63440	63440	I	0	" he said from somewhere inside his dressing - gown . "
63499	63592	63440	63440	I	0	" He pushed her upright , turned the light back on , yanked the dressing - gown closed around her and slithered off the bed , smoothing his hair down over his forehead with both hands , then straightening his sweater . He stood in the middle of the room for an instant , glaring wildly at the bedroom doorway , then dashed across the room , seized the chessboard , dropped it onto the bed , and sat down facing her . He quickly began to set the toppled pieces upright . "
63595	63622	63623	63623	We	1162	" he said calmly a moment later , to someone who had presumably appeared in the doorway . Marian was feeling too dishevelled to look around . "
63632	63634	63623	63623	We	1162	" 145 "
63645	63653	63654	63654	Marian	112	" Why get all upset about it ? "
63671	63701	63654	63654	Marian	112	" It 's nothing to be disturbed about , it 's all perfectly natural , you know . If anything it 's their fault for barging in like that . "
63709	63716	63717	63717	he	1164	" Well , I told you , "
63732	63766	63767	63767	He	1164	" They think they 're my parents . You know parents never understand about things like that . They 'd think you were corrupting me . They have to be protected from reality . "
63955	63958	63954	63954	him	53	" nicely packaged "
64030	64339	64340	64340	Darling	131	" more or less 146 public way caused her to reach across the table and take his hand . He put his own hand on top of hers in answer . The waiter appeared with the wine , and Peter tasted it and nodded . The waiter poured and stepped back into the darkness . That was another nice thing about Peter . He could make that kind of decision so effortlessly . She had fallen into the habit in the last month or so of letting him choose for her . It got rid of the vacillation she had found herself displaying when confronted with a menu : she never knew what she wanted to have . But Peter could make up their minds right away . His taste ran towards steak and roast beef : he did not care for peculiar things like sweetbreads , and he did n't like fish at all . Tonight they were having Filet Mignon . Already it was fairly late , they had spent the earlier hours of the evening at Peter 's apartment , and they were both , they had told each other , ravenous . Waiting for their food , they resumed the conversation they had begun earlier , while they were getting dressed again , about the proper education of children . Peter talked theoretically , about children as a category , carefully avoiding any application . But she knew perfectly well that it was their own future children they were really discussing : that was why it was so important . Peter thought that all children ought to be punished for breaches of discipline ; even physically . Of course no one should ever strike a child in anger ; the main thing was to be consistent . Marian was afraid of warping their emotions . "
64349	64353	64340	64340	Darling	131	" Peter said ; "
64361	64367	64340	64340	Darling	131	" He squeezed her hand . "
64401	64426	64340	64340	Darling	131	" He compressed his lips . Marian was secretly , convinced she was right and resented being told she had led a sheltered life . "
64439	64444	64340	64340	Darling	131	" He smiled indulgently . "
64563	64564	64554	64554	They	1170	" "
64567	64572	64573	64573	somebody	656	" Marian said primly , "
64596	64597	64586	64586	Children	2151	" "
64608	64612	64600	64600	I	0	" Peter said . "
64624	64625	64626	64626	You	1179	" "
64644	64923	64641	64641	I	0	" Peter chuckled warmly . Her disapproval of that incident and his laughter at her for it had become one of the reference points in their new pattern . But Marian 's serenity had vanished with her own remark . She looked intently at Peter , trying to see his eyes , but he was glancing down at his wineglass , admiring perhaps the liquid richness of the red against the white of the tablecloth . He had leaned back a little in his chair and his face was now in shadow . She wondered why restaurants like this one were kept so dark . Probably to keep people from seeing each other very clearly while they were eating . After all , chewing and swallowing are pleasanter for those doing them than for those watching , she thought , and observing one 's partner too closely might dispel the aura of romance that the restaurant was trying to maintain . Or create . She examined the blade of her knife . The waiter stepped forward from somewhere , soft and deft as a cat on the carpeted floor , and set her order before her : the filet on a wooden platter , oozing juicily within its perimeter of bacon . They both liked it rare : synchronizing the cooking times would never be a problem at any rate . Marian was so hungry she would have liked to devour the steak at one gulp . She began slicing and chewing , conveying the food to her grateful stomach . She was reconsidering the conversation , trying to get a clearer image of what she had meant by "
64925	65153	64626	64626	You	1179	" . She thought that it ought to mean being fair , but even her notion of that became hazy around the edges as she looked at it . Did it mean an eye 148 for an eye ? And what good did it do anyway to destroy someone else 's eye if you had lost your own ? What about compensation ? It seemed to be a matter of money in things like car accidents ; you could even be awarded money for having suffered emotional distress . Once on a streetcar she had seen a mother bite a small child because it had bitten her . She gnawed thoughtfully through a tough piece , and swallowed . Peter , she decided , was n't himself today . He had had a difficult case , one that involved a lot of intricate research ; he had gone through precedent after precedent only to find that they all favoured the opposition . That was why he was making stern pronouncements : he was frustrated by complications , he wanted simplicity . He should realize though that if the laws were n't complicated he would never make any money . She reached for her wine glass , and looked up . Peter was watching her . He was three - quarters finished and she was n't even half . "
65156	65161	64626	64626	You	1179	" he said mellowly . "
65170	66462	64626	64626	You	1179	" She smiled at him and returned her attention to the platter . Lately he had been watching her more and more . Before , in the summer , she used to think he did n't often look at her , did n't often really see her ; in bed afterwards he would stretch out beside her and press his face against her shoulder , and sometimes he would go to sleep . These days however he would focus his eyes on her face , concentrating on her as though if he looked hard enough he would be able to see through her flesh and her skull and into the workings of her brain . She could n't tell what he was searching for when he looked at her like that . It made her uneasy . Frequently when they were lying side by side exhausted on the bed she would open her eyes and realize that he had been watching her like that , hoping perhaps to surprise a secret expression on that face . Then he would run his hand gently over her skin , without passion , almost clinically , as if he could learn by touch whatever it was that had escaped the probing of his eyes . Or as if he was trying to memorize her . It was when she would begin feeling that she was on a doctor 's examination table that she would take hold of his hand to make him stop . 149 She picked at her salad , turning the various objects in the wooden bowl over with her fork : she wanted a piece of tomato . Maybe he had got hold of one of those marriage - manuals ; maybe that was why . It would be just like Peter , she thought with fondness . If you got something new you went out and bought a book that told you how to work it . She thought of the books and magazines on cameras that were part of the collection on the middle shelf in his room , between the law books and the detective novels . And he always kept the car manual in the glove compartment . So it would be according to his brand of logic to go out and buy a book on marriage , now that he was going to get married ; one with easy - tofollow diagrams . She was amused . She spiked and devoured a black olive from her salad . That must be it . He was sizing her up as he would a new camera , trying to find the central complex of wheels and tiny mechanisms , the possible weak points , the kind of future performance to be expected : the springs of the machine . He wanted to know what made her tick . If that was what he was looking for .... She smiled to herself . Now I 'm making things up , she thought . He was almost finished . She watched the capable hands holding the knife and fork , slicing precisely with an exact adjustment of pressures . How skilfully he did it : no tearing , no ragged edges . And yet it was a violent action , cutting ; and violence in connection with Peter seemed incongruous to her . Like the Moose Beer commercials , which had begun to appear everywhere , in the subway trains , on hoardings , in magazines . Because she had worked on the pre - marketing survey she felt partially responsible for them ; not that they were doing any harm . The fisherman wading in the stream , scooping the trout into his net , was too tidy : he looked as though his hair had just been combed , a few strands glued neatly to his forehead to show he was windblown . And the fish also was unreal ; it had no slime , no teeth , no smell ; it was a clever toy , metal and enamel . The hunter who had killed a deer stood posed and urbane , no twigs in his hair , his hands bloodless . Of course you did n't want anything in an advertisement to be ugly or upsetting ; it would n't do , for instance , to have a deer with its tongue sticking out . 150 She was reminded of the newspaper that morning , the front page story she had skimmed over without paying much attention . The young boy who had gone berserk with a rifle and killed nine people before he was cornered by the police . Shooting out of an upstairs window . She remembered him now , grey and white , gripped by two darker policemen , the eyes remote , guarded . He was n't the kind who would hit anyone with his fist or even use a knife . When he chose violence it was a removed violence , a manipulation of specialized instruments , the finger guiding But never touching , he himself watching the explosion from a distance ; the explosion of flesh and blood . It was a violence of the mind , almost like magic : you thought it and it happened . Watching him operating on the steak like that , carving a straight slice and then dividing it into neat cubes , made her think of the diagram of the planned cow at the front of one of her cookbooks : the cow with lines on it and labels to show you from which part of the cow all the different cuts were taken . What they were eating now was from some part of the back , she thought : cut on the dotted line . She could see rows of butchers somewhere in a large room , a butcher school , sitting at tables , clothed in spotless white , each with a pair of kindergarten scissors , cutting out steaks and ribs and roasts from the stacks of brown - paper cow - shapes before them . The cow in the book , she recalled , was drawn with eyes and horns and an udder . It stood there quite naturally , not at all disturbed by the peculiar markings painted on its hide . Maybe with lots of careful research they 'll eventually be able to breed them , she thought , so that they 're born already ruled and measured . She looked down at her own half - eaten steak and suddenly saw it as a hunk of muscle . Blood red . Part of a real cow that once moved and ate and was killed , knocked on the head as it stood in a queue like someone waiting for a streetcar . Of course everyone knew that . But most of the time you never thought about it . In the supermarket they had it all pre - packaged in cellophane , with namelabels and price - labels stuck on it , and it was just like buying a jar of peanut - butter or a can of beans , and even when you went into a butcher shop they wrapped it up so efficiently and quickly that it was made clean , official . But now it was suddenly there in 151 front of her with no intervening paper , it was flesh and blood , rare , and she had been devouring it . Gorging herself on it . She set down her knife and fork . She felt that she had turned rather pale , and hoped that Peter would n't notice . "
66467	66472	64626	64626	You	1179	" she lectured herself . "
66503	66530	64626	64626	You	1179	" She picked up her fork , speared a piece , lifted it , and set it down again . Peter raised his head , smiling . "
66536	66540	66532	66532	I	0	" he said , "
66563	66580	66586	66586	darling	434	" She nodded , and smiled back limply . He shifted his glance to her platter . "
66593	66594	66588	66588	You	434	" "
66597	66601	66588	66588	You	434	" she said , "
66618	66658	66614	66614	I	0	" She meant to indicate by her tone of voice that her stomach was too tiny and helpless to cope with that vast quantity of food . Peter smiled and chewed , pleasantly conscious of his own superior capacity . "
66661	66667	66614	66614	I	0	" she thought to herself , "
66681	66947	66675	66675	I	0	" She sat twisting her napkin unhappily between her fingers , watching the last of Peter 's steak disappear into his mouth . Marian was sitting at the kitchen table , disconsolately eating a jar of peanut butter and turning over the pages of her largest cookbook . The day after the filet , she had been unable to eat a pork chop , and since then , for several weeks , she had been making experiments . She had discovered that not only were things too obviously cut from the Planned Cow inedible for her , but that the Planned Pig and the Planned Sheep were similarly forbidden . Whatever it was that had been making these decisions , not her mind certainly , rejected anything that had an indication of bone or tendon or fibre . Things that had been ground up and re - shaped , hot - dogs 152 and hamburgers for instance , or lamb patties or pork sausages , were all right as long as she did n't look at them too closely , and fish was still permitted . She had been afraid to try chicken : she had been fond of it once , but it came with an unpleasantly complete skeletal structure , and the skin , she predicted , would be too much like an arm with goose bumps . For protein variety she had been eating omelettes and peanuts and quantities of cheese . The quiet fear , that came nearer to the surface now as she scanned the pages - she was in the "
66949	67005	67006	67006	I	0	" section - was that this thing , this refusal of her mouth to eat , was malignant ; that it would spread ; that slowly the circle now dividing the non - devourable from the devourable would become smaller and smaller , that the objects available to her would be excluded one by one . "
67013	67019	67006	67006	I	0	" she was thinking sadly , "
67036	67050	67140	67140	Len	87	" She read , with distaste , a column headed Hints For Serving Yoghurt "
67062	67119	67140	67140	Len	87	" the editress suggested with glee . The telephone rang . She let it ring a couple of times before getting up to answer it . She did n't feel like talking to anyone and it was an effort to pull herself up out of the gentle realm of lettuce and watercress and piquant herb dressings . "
67122	67130	67120	67120	Marian	112	" It was Leonard Slank 's voice . "
67135	67136	67133	67133	you	112	" "
67142	67146	67140	67140	Len	87	" she said . "
67151	67172	67140	67140	Len	87	" She had n't seen him or even spoken to him for quite a long time . He sounded urgent . "
67183	67184	67180	67180	AinsJey	132	" "
67205	67231	67195	67195	She	132	" It was the Christmas season ; had been , it seemed , for several months ; and the stores were staying open till nine . "
67245	67246	67236	67236	her	132	" "
67250	67255	67236	67236	her	132	" he said hastily . "
67270	67298	67303	67303	Len	87	" Peter was working on a case that night , so technically she was n't busy ; and her brain did not provide her with any excuse . "
67305	68166	67303	67303	Len	87	" she said . So she 's told him , she thought as she put down the phone . The idiot . I wonder what she did that for . Ainsley had been in the highest of spirits for the past few weeks . She had been certain from the beginning that she was pregnant , and 155 her mind had hovered over the activities of her body with the solicitous attention of a scientist towards a crucial test - tube , waiting for the definitive change . She spent more time than usual in the kitchen , trying to decide whether or not she had strange cravings and sampling a multitude of foods to see if they tasted at all different , reporting her findings to Marian : tea , she said , was more bitter , eggs were sulphury . She stood on Marian 's bed to examine the profile of her belly in Marian 's dresser - mirror , which was bigger than her own . When she wandered around the apartment she hummed to herself , constantly , intolerably ; and finally one morning she had retched in the kitchen sink , to her immense satisfaction . At last it had been time to go and see the gynaecologist , and just yesterday she had bounced up the stairs , her face radiant , waving an envelope : the result was Positive . Marian congratulated her , but not as dourly as she would have done if it had happened several months earlier . At that time she would have had to cope with the resulting problems , such as where Ainsley would live - the lady down below would certainly not tolerate her once she became rotund - and whether she herself should get another room - mate , and if so , whether she would feel guilty about deserting Ainsley , and if not , whether she could face all the intricacies and tensions that would result from living with an unmarried mother and a newborn baby . But now it was n't her concern , and she could afford to sound genuinely pleased for Ainsley 's sake . After all , she herself was getting married ; she had contrAd^dout^ \t was because she did n't want to be involved that she resented Len 's phone call . From the tone of his voice she guessed Ainsley had told him something , but it had n't been clear from the conversation exactly what he knew . She was already resolved to be as passive as possible . She would listen , of course - she had ears , she could n't help it - to whatever he had to say ( what was there for him to say , anyway ? His function , such as it had been , was over ) ; but beyond that there was nothing she could do . She felt incapable of handling the situation , and irritated too : if Len wanted to talk to anyone he should talk to Ainsley . She was the one with the answers . 154 Marian ate another spoonful of peanut butter , disliking the wayit cleaved to the roof of her mouth , and to pass the time turned to the shellfish chapter and read the part about de - veining shrimps ( who , she wondered , still bought real shrimps ? ) and then the instructions for turtles , which she had recently begun to find of interest : precisely what kind of interest , she was not certain . You were supposed to keep your live turtle in a cardboard box or other cage for about a week , loving it and feeding it hamburger to rid it of its impurities . Then just as it was beginning to trust you and perhaps follow you around the kitchen like a sluggish but devoted hard - shelled spaniel , you put it one day into a cauldron of cold water ( where no doubt it would swim and dive happily , at first ) and then brought it slowly to the boil . The whole procedure was reminiscent of the deaths of early Christian martyrs . What fiendish - J^ ^ ness went on in kitchens across the country , in the name of providing J food ! But the only alternative for that sort of thing seemed to be H'x-*-*A*L _ the cellowrapped and plasticoated and cardboard - cartoned surrogates . Substitutes , or merely disguises ? At any rate , whatever killing had gone on had been done efficiently , by somebody else , beforehand . Down below the doorbell rang . Marian tensed , listening : she did n't want to start down the stairs if it was n't necessary . She heard a mumble of voices and the reverberation of the closing door . The lady down below had been on the alert . She sighed , closed the cookbook , tossed her spoon into the sink after giving it one last lick , and screwed the top on the peanut butter jar . "
68169	68194	67303	67303	Len	87	" she said to Len as he rose , white - faced and out of breath , from the stairwell . He looked ill . "
68202	68216	67303	67303	Len	87	" Then , because it was only six - thirty , she asked , "
68228	68269	67303	67303	Len	87	" She wanted to prepare something for him , if only a bacon - and - tomato sandwich . Ever since her own relation to food had become ambiguous she found she took a gery^rsje^eH^l^iG - watching other people eat . "
68273	68277	67303	67303	Len	87	" he said , "
68295	68327	68290	68290	you	0	" He walked into the living room and plopped himself onto the chesterfield as though his body was a sack that he was too tired to carry around any longer . 155 "
68337	68371	68290	68290	you	0	" She went into the kitchen , opened two bottles , and carried them into the living room . With good friends like Len she did n't bother with the formality of glasses . "
68374	68401	68290	68290	you	0	" he said . He upended the squat brown bottle . His mouth , pursed budlike around the bottleneck , was for a moment strangely infantile . "
68409	68422	68423	68423	I	0	" he said , putting the bottle down on the coffee table . "
68431	68462	68425	68425	she	1193	" Marian sipped at her beer before replying . It was Moose Beer ; she had bought some out of curiosity . It tasted just like all the other brands . "
68470	68479	68463	68463	You	0	" she said in a neutral conversational tone . "
68485	68503	68463	68463	You	0	" Len groaned . He took off his hornrimmed glasses and pressed one hand over his eyes . "
68513	68517	68506	68506	I	0	" he said . "
68757	68813	68814	68814	I	0	" Marian sat watching him silently . Ainsley , then , had n't had a chance to explain her motives . She wondered whether she should attempt to unsnarl , for Len 's benefit , that rather improbable tangle , or wait and let Ainsley do it herself , as by right she ought to . "
68822	68827	68816	68816	I	0	" Len said miserably . "
68869	68872	68873	68873	he	1203	" Birth , "
68883	68900	68902	68902	he	1203	" birth terrifies me . It 's revolting . I ca n't stand the thought of having "
68905	68909	68902	68902	he	1203	" a baby . "
68910	68927	68928	68928	Marian	112	" Well , it is n't you who 's going to have it , you know , "
68981	68984	68985	68985	he	1203	" Marian , "
68988	69016	68985	68985	he	1203	" please , ca n't you try to reason with her ? If she 'd only decide to have an abortion , of course*;I'll pay for it . "
69042	69050	69051	69051	she	112	" I 'm afraid she wo n't , "
69055	69071	69051	69051	she	112	" You see , the whole point of it was that she wanted'to get pregnant . "
69072	69076	69020	69020	she	112	" She what ? "
69077	69090	69051	69051	she	112	" She did it on purpose . She wanted to get pregnant . "
69091	69096	69097	69097	Len	87	" That 's ridiculous ! "
69100	69116	69097	69097	Len	87	" Nobody wants to get pregnant . Nobody would deliberately do a thing like that ! "
69153	69170	69143	69143	she	112	" Now Leonard , it 's high time I told you about the Facts of Life . "
69171	69177	69178	69178	she	112	" You 'd be surprised , "
69181	69264	69178	69178	she	112	" a lot of people do . It 's fashionable these days , you know ; and Ainsley reads a lot ; she was particularly fond of anthropology at college , and she 's convinced that no woman has fulfilled her feminity unless she 's had a baby . But do n't worry , you wo n't have to be involved any further . She does n't want a husband , just a baby . So you 've already done your bit . "
69300	69322	69323	69323	he	87	" So she 's been to college , too . 17 should have known . That 's what we get then , "
69327	69341	69323	69323	he	87	" for / educating women . They get all kinds of ridiculous ideas . "
69343	69351	69352	69352	Marian	112	" Oh , I do n't know , "
69360	69374	69352	69352	Marian	112	" there 's some men it does n't do much good for either . "
69379	69404	69376	69376	Len	87	" Meaning me , I suppose . But how was I to know ? You certainly did n't tell me . What a friend . "
69405	69423	69424	69424	Marian	112	" Why , I 'd never presume to try and tell you how to run your life , "
69428	69470	69424	69424	Marian	112	" But why should you be upset , now that you know ? You do n't have to do anything . She 'll take care of the whole business . Believe me , Ainsley 's quite capable of looking after herself . "
69484	69489	69490	69490	he	87	" The little slut , "
69493	69500	69490	69490	he	87	" Getting mejnto something like this .... "
69501	69512	69424	69424	Marian	112	" * * ~ There were footsteps on the stairs . "
69515	69519	69490	69490	he	87	" Marian said , "
69528	69540	69490	69490	he	87	" She went out into the small vestibule to greet Ainsley . "
69551	69581	69549	69549	I	0	" Ainsley called , lilting up the stairs . She bustled into the kitchen , setting her parcels on the table and taking off her coat and talking breathlessly . "
69628	69642	69615	69615	I	0	" She produced a knitting book , then some blue baby - wool . "
69652	69661	69649	69650	a boy	1206	" Marian said . Ainsley 's eyes widened . "
69675	69676	69666	69666	I	0	" "
69716	69721	69704	69704	he	1207	" Marian said maliciously , "
69729	69745	69704	69704	he	1207	" Ainsley pushed back a strand of auburn hair that had fallen over her forehead . "
69755	69763	69753	69753	he	1207	" she said , with pronounced coolness . "
69775	69830	69766	69766	He	1207	" She walked into the living room . Marian did not know which of them needed her support more or which she would give it to if forced to choose between them . She followed Ainsley , aware that she should extricate herself before the thing got much messier , but not knowing how . "
69834	69839	69832	69832	Len	87	" Ainsley said lightly . "
69853	69861	69840	69840	You	87	" Len would n't look at her . "
69869	69884	69862	69862	Marian	112	" 158 Ainsley pouted reproachfully . She had evidently wanted to do it herself . "
69894	69907	69908	69908	He	87	" Marian said , compressing her lips in a slightly presbyterian manner . "
69912	69913	69908	69908	He	87	" "
69924	69928	69915	69915	I	0	" Ainsley said , "

69978	69983	69969	69969	I	0	" he burst out . "

70154	70168	70169	70169	you	0	" - he gasped : the idea was a novel one for him - "
70173	70183	70169	70169	you	0	" He waved his beer - bottle at her . "

70374	70378	70373	70373	I	0	" he cried . "
70407	70421	70422	70422	Marian	112	" he yelped , as Ainsley took a step towards him . ^Yo^rejinclean ! "

We were having eggs for breakfast and I opened mine and there was , I swear there was a little chicken inside it , it was n't born yet , I did n't want to touch it but she did n't see , she did n't see what was really there , she said Do n't be silly , it looks like an ordinary egg to me , but it was n't , it was n't and she made me eat it . And I know , I know there was a little beak and little claws and everything .... "

73032	73111	73029	73029	Marian	112	" Oh this girl who was living with some friends of mine in England and she just stopped washing . Nothing else was wrong with her , she just did n't wash , even her hair even , or change her clothes or anything , for the longest time , and they did n't want to say anything because she seemed perfectly normal in every other way , but OJ^YJPUsly underneath if - she . rrmsthave been really sifk "

73168	73200	73158	73158	Lucy	72	" it got pretty horrible . I mean , she was wearing the same clothes , you can imagine . And I guess it must have been three or four months . "
73206	73211	73213	73213	she	72	" Oh no 's , "
73216	73286	73213	73213	she	72	" Well , at least two . And they were just about to ask her for god 's sake either take a bath or move out . I mean , would n't you ? But one day she came home and just took off those clothes and burnt them , and had a bath and everything , and she 's been perfectly normal ever since . Just like that . "
73287	73293	73294	73294	Emmy	71	" Well that // queer ! "
73315	73330	73331	73331	Millie	71	" Of course they 're all a lot dirtier Over There , you know , "

73356	73395	73353	73353	Lucy	72	" I mean she 'd been JDrought - upjhe right way , she was from a good family and all ; it was n't as if they did n't have a bathroom , they were always perfectly clean ! "
73396	73411	73413	73413	Millie	71	" Maybe it was one of those things we sort of all go through , "
73416	73433	73413	73413	Millie	71	" Maybe she was just immature , and being away from home like that and all .... "
73434	73441	73442	73442	Lucy	72	" I think she was sick , "

77778	77796	77797	77797	she	52	" Well , I suppose you have to have a traditional wedding , since it 's Peter , "
77801	77854	77797	77797	she	52	" But people are so hypo- 175 critical about flowers at weddings . Nobody wants to admit they 're really fertility symbols . What about a giant sunflower or a sheaf of wheat ? Or a cascade of mushrooms and cactuses , that would be quite genital , do n't you think ? "
77866	77879	77880	77880	he	53	" I 'll leave all that sort of thing up to you , "
78074	78078	78072	78072	them	1426	" the soap men "
78173	78422	78172	78172	She	112	" had been guilty of neglecting them anyway ; though it was curious , she thought , how married people always assumed they were being neglected when you did n't phone them , even when they themselves had been too dug under to even think of phoning you . Peter had been recalcitrant ; he had seen the inside of Clara 's living room once . As soon as she had issued the invitations she realized that the menu would be a major problem . She could n't feed them milk and peanut butter and vitamin pills , or a salad with cottage cheese , i76 she could n't have fish because Peter did n't like it , but she could n't serve meat either - because what would they all think when they saw her not eating any of it ? She could n't possibly explain ; if she did n't understand it herself , how could she expect them to ? In the past month the few forms that had been available to her had excluded themselves from her diet : hamburger after a funny story of Peter 's about a friend of his who had got some analysed just for a joke and had discovered it contained ground - up mouse hairs ; pork because Emmy during a coffee break had entertained them with an account of trichinosis and a lady she knew who got it — she mentioned the name with almost religious awe ( "
78464	78481	78457	78457	they	1439	" ) ; and mutton and lamb because Duncan had told her the etymology of the word "
78483	78492	78457	78457	they	1439	" : it came , he said , from "
78494	78599	78457	78457	they	1439	" , which was a loss of equilibrium in sheep caused by large white worms in their brains . Even hot dogs had been ruled out ; after all , her stomach reasoned , they could mash up any old thing and stick it in there . In restaurants she could always hedge by ordering a salad , but that would never do for guests , not for dinner . And she could n't serve them Vegetarian Baked Beans . She had fallen back on a casserole , a mushroom - and - meatballs affair of her mother 's which would disguise things effectively . "
78610	78614	78600	78600	I	0	" she thought , "
78628	78763	78600	78600	I	0	" She could dish herself a very small helping , eat the mushrooms , and roll the meat balls under one of the lettuce leaves from the accompanying salad . It was n't an elegant solution but it was the best she could do . Now , hurriedly slicing up the radishes for the salad , she was grateful for several things : that she had made the casserole the night before so all she had to do was stick it in the oven ; that Clara and Joe were coming late , after they had put the children to bed ; and that she could still eat salad . She was becoming more and more irritated by her body 's decision to reject certain foods . She had tried to reason with it , "
78896	78902	78903	78903	she	0	" The thing to do , "
78908	78914	78903	78903	she	0	" is to keep calm . "

And I was so happy , and I was doing my knitting and everything during the first speaker - he talked about The Advantages of Breast Feeding . They even have an Association for it now . But then they had this psy - psy - psychologist , and he talked about the Father Image . "
80550	80567	80568	80568	she	112	" He says they ought to grow up with a strong Father Image in the home , "
80576	80594	80568	80568	she	112	" It 's good for them , it makes them normal , especially if they 're boys . "
80595	80610	80611	80611	Marian	112	" Well , but you sort of knew that before , did n't you ? "
80614	80642	80643	80643	She	112	" Oh no Marian , it 's really a lot more drastic . He has all kinds of statistics and everything . They 've proved it scientifically . "

81215	81220	81209	81209	he	54	" Monosyllables in Milton , "
81244	81252	81235	81235	He	54	" It is indeed highly significant that ... "
81278	81291	81292	81292	she	112	" Why do n't you find a female graduate student in English ? "
81325	81333	81334	81334	he	54	" That would n't be an escape , "
81337	81356	81357	81357	he	54	" they 're all writing term - papers too ; we 'd have to discuss them . Besides , "
81361	81371	81372	81372	he	54	" they do n't have enough breasts . Or , "
81378	81386	81372	81372	he	54	" some of them have too many . "

81528	81541	81525	81525	Peter	53	" ? his mouth in approximately the same position , would whisper \ "
81545	82030	81542	81542	I	0	" and wait for the echo , she had to exert herself . J She guessed that she was using Duncan too , although her motives eluded her ; as all her motives tended to these days . The 183 long time she had been moving through ( and it was strange to realize that she had after all been moving : she was due to leave for home in another two weeks , the day after a party Peter was going to give , and two , or was it three , weeks after that she would be married ) had been merely a period of waiting , drifting with the current , an endurance of time marked by no real event ; waiting for an event in the future that had been determined by an event in the past ; whereas when she was with Duncan she was caught in an eddy of present time : they had virtually no past and certainly no future . Duncan was irritatingly unconcerned about her marriage . He would listen to the few things she had to say about it , grin slightly when she would say she thought it was a good idea , then shrug and tell her neutrally that it sounded evil to him but that she seemed to be managing perfectly well and that anyway it was her problem . Then he would direct the conversation towards the complex and ever - fascinating subject of himself . He did n't seem to care about what would happen to her after she passed out of the range of his perpetual present : the only comment he had ever made about the time after her marriage implied that he supposed he would have to dig up another substitute . She found his lack of interest comforting , though she did n't want to know why . They were passing through the Oriental section . There were many pale vases and glazed and lacquered dishes . Marian glanced at an immense wall - screen that was covered with small golden images of the gods and goddesses , arranged around a gigantic central figure : an obese Buddha - like creature , smiling like Mrs. Bogue controlling by divine will her vast army of dwarfed housewives , serenely , inscrutably . Whatever the reasons though she was always glad when he telephoned , urgent and distraught , and asked her to meet him . They had to arrange out - of - the - way places - snowy parks , art galleries , the occasional bar ( though never the Park Plaza ) - which meant that their few embraces had been unpremeditated , furtive , gelid , and much hampered by muffling layers of winter clothing . That morning he had phoned her at work and suggested , or rather demanded , the Museum : "
82036	82303	81542	81542	I	0	" he had said . She 184 had fled the office early , pleading a dental appointment . It did n't matter anyway , she was leaving at last in a week and her successor was already training for the job . The Museum was a good place : Peter would never go there . She dreaded having Peter and Duncan encounter each other . An irrational dread because for one thing there was no reason , she told herself , why Peter should be upset - it had nothing to do with him , there was obviously no question of competition or anything silly like that - and , for another , even if they did collide she could always explain Duncan as an old friend from college or something of the sort . She would be safe ; but what she really seemed to fear was the destruction , not of anything in her relationship with Peter , but of one of the two by the other ; though who would be destroyed by whom , or why , she could n't tell , and most of the time she was surprised at herself for having such vague premonitions . Nevertheless it was for this reason that she could n't let him come to her apartment . It would be too great a risk . She had gone to his place several times , but one or both of the roommates had always been there , suspicious and awkwardly resentful . That would make Duncan more nervous than ever and they would leave quickly . "
82311	82329	82307	82307	they	1501	" she asked . They had paused to look at a suit of intricately embossed Chinese armour . "
82332	82333	82334	82334	Them	1501	" "
82351	82352	82341	82341	they	1501	" "
82408	82416	82402	82402	I	0	" he said , suppressing a smile , "
82479	82480	82472	82472	They	1501	" "
82496	82498	82491	82491	they	1501	" 185 "

82530	82538	82523	82523	they	1501	" she asked indignantly . Duncan considered . "
82688	82774	82776	82776	you	1509	" Marian felt compassion ; she started to make a mental list of ageing single girls she knew who might be suitable for Fish . Millie ? Lucy ? They walked on , turned another corner , and found themselves in yet another room full of glass cases . By this time she was thoroughly lost . The labyrinthine corridors and large halls and turnings had confused her sense of direction . There seemed to be no one else in this part of the Museum . "
82782	82790	82776	82776	you	1509	" £ k?)asked , a little anxiously . "
82793	82797	82776	82776	you	1509	" he said . "
82803	82852	82798	82798	We	1510	" They went under another archway . In contrast to the crowded and gilded oriental rooms they had been passing through , this one was comparatively grey and empty . Marian realized , from the murals on the walls , that they were in the Ancient Egyptian section . "
82859	82867	82798	82798	We	1510	" Duncan said , almost to himself , "
82881	83004	83005	83005	She	1511	" Marian looked down through the glass at the painted golden face . The stylized eyes , edged with dark - blue lines , were wide open . They gazed up at her with an expression of serene vacancy . Across the front of the figure , at chest - level , was a painted bird with outstretched wings , each feather separately defined ; a similar bird was painted across the thighs , and another one at the feet . The rest of 186 the decorations were smaller : several orange suns , gilded figures with crowns on their heads , seated on thrones or being ferried in boats ; and a repeated design of odd symbols that were like eyes . "
83009	83022	83005	83005	She	1511	" Marian said . She wonderedwhether jhejreaJly tjiquglrtsq . Under the surface of the"£ETtr^£h£da
83034	83045	83046	83046	Duncan	54	" I think it 's supposed to be a man , "
83058	83098	83049	83049	He	54	" Sometimes I think I 'd like to live forever . Then you would n't have to worry about Time anymore . Ah , Mutabilitie ; I wonder why trying to transcend time never even succeeds in stopping it .... "
83155	83159	83160	83160	Duncan	54	" Very well preserved "
83175	83199	83168	83168	he	54	" They could never do a job like that now , though a lot of those commercial body - snatchers pretend they can . "
83262	83268	83269	83269	she	1511	" You 're being morbid , "
83272	83279	83280	83280	Duncan	54	" What 's wrong with death ? "
83292	83313	83283	83283	his	54	" There 's nothing morbid about it ; we all do it , you know , it 's perfectly natural . "
83314	83323	83331	83331	He	54	" It 's not natural to like it , "
83337	83344	83345	83345	he	54	" Do n't take me seriously , "
83348	83407	83345	83345	he	54	" I 've warned you about that . Now come on and I 'll show you my womb - symbol . I 'm going to show it to Fish pretty soon . He 's threatening to write a short monograph for Victorian Studies called ' Womb - Symbols in Beatrix Potter . ' He has to be stopped . "
83497	83506	83507	83507	Duncan	54	" It 's sort of pre - pyramid , "
83510	83561	83507	83507	Duncan	54	" Preserved by the sands of the desert . When I get really fed up with this place I 'm going to go and dig myself in . Maybe the library would serve the purpose just as well ; except this city is kind of damp . Things would rot . "
83665	83670	83671	83671	he	54	" Do n't worry , "
83674	83685	83671	83671	he	54	" I 'm not going to return from the tomb . "
83703	83759	83760	83760	He	54	" The trouble is , especially with people and when I 'm touching them and so on , I ca n't concentrate on the surface . As long as you only think about the surface I suppose it 's all right , and real enough ; but once you start thinking about what 's inside .... "
83851	83857	83858	83858	he	54	" Pardon me , sir , "
83865	83879	83858	83858	he	54	" but - ah - kissing in the Mummy Room is not permitted . "
83880	83883	83885	83885	Duncan	54	" Oh , "
83887	83890	83885	83885	Duncan	54	" Sorry . "
84024	84027	84028	84028	he	54	" Cream ? "
84031	84035	84036	84036	she	112	" No thanks , "
84055	84073	84074	84074	Duncan	54	" You know , I think it might be a good idea if we went to bed , "
84168	84185	84162	84162	Peter	53	" What 's this I hear about you seeing a lot of some scrawny academic type ? "
84191	84214	84187	84187	she	112	" Do n't be silly Peter , it 's perfectly innocent . After all , we 're getting married in two months . "
84226	84233	84234	84234	she	112	" Do n't be silly Duncan , "
84237	84253	84234	84234	she	112	" that 's impossible . After all , I 'm getting married in a month . "
84254	84260	84261	84261	he	54	" That 's your problem , "
84264	84287	84261	84261	he	54	" it has nothing to do with me . And it 's me I thought it would be a good idea for . "
84288	84291	84292	84292	she	112	" Why ? "
84315	84391	84392	84392	He	54	" Well of course it 's not you . It 's just it . I mean you personally do n't arouse exactly a raging lust in me or anything . But I thought you would know how , and you 'd be competent and sensible about it , sort of calm . Unlike some . I think it would be a good thing if 189 I could get over this thing I have about sex . "
84414	84418	84392	84392	He	54	" What thing ? "
84419	84429	84430	84430	He	54	" Well , maybe I 'm a latent homosexual . "
84437	84707	84708	84708	He	1530	" Or maybe I 'm a latent heterosexual . Anyway I 'm pretty latent . I do n't know why , really . Of course I 've taken a number of stabs at it , but then I start thinking about the futility of it all and I give up . Maybe it 's because you 're expected to do something and after a certain point all I want to do is lie there and stare at the ceiling . When I 'm supposed to be writing term - papers I think about sex , but when I 've finally got some willing lovely backed into a corner or we 're thrashing about under hedges and so on and everybody is supposed to be all set for the coup de grace > I start thinking about term - papers . I know it 's an alternation of distractions , both of those things are basically distractions you know , but what am I really being distracted from ? Anyway they 're all too literary , it 's because they have n't read enough books . If they 'd read more they 'd realize that all those scenes have been done already . I mean ad nauseum . How can they be so trite ? They sort of get limp and sinuous and passionate , they try so hard , and I start thinking oh god it 's yet another bad imitation of whoever it happens to be a bad imitation of , and I lose interest . Or worse , I start to laugh . Then they get hysterical . "
84718	84731	84708	84708	He	1530	" What makes you think it would be any different with me ? "
84767	84770	84771	84771	he	1530	" Well , "
84774	84796	84771	84771	he	1530	" it probably would n't be . But now that I 've told you at least you would n't get hysterical . "
84848	84851	84852	84852	she	1531	" Well ... "
84946	84956	84957	84957	she	1531	" That 's one of your parents over there , "
84964	84967	84968	84968	he	54	" Oh , "
84971	84979	84980	84980	He	54	" I 'd better go say hello . "
85007	85021	85022	85022	he	54	" Trevor wants to know if you 'd like to come to dinner , "
85036	85043	85044	85044	she	1531	" Do you want me to ? "
85047	85061	85022	85022	he	54	" Me ? Oh , sure . I guess so . Why not ? "
85062	85067	85068	85068	she	1531	" Tell him then , "
85071	85078	85068	85068	she	1531	" that I 'd be delighted . "
85124	85131	85132	85132	he	54	" Trevor said that 's thrilling , "
85135	85164	85132	85132	he	54	" and he 'll just rush off and pop a few things in the oven . Nothing fancy , he says . We 're expected in an hour . "
85190	85199	85200	85200	she	112	" What do you think he 'll have ? "
85207	85227	85204	85204	Duncan	54	" Oh , I do n't know . He likes skewering things and setting fire to them . Why ? "
85228	85231	85232	85232	she	112	" Well , "
85235	85269	85232	85232	she	112	" there are a lot of things I ca n't eat ; I mean , I have n't been eating them lately . Meat , for instance , and eggs and certain vegetables . "
85279	85284	85285	85285	he	54	" Well , okay , "
85288	85335	85285	85285	he	54	" but Trevor 's very proud of his cooking . I mean I do n't care , I 'd just as soon eat hamburger any day , but he 'll be insulted if you do n't eat at least some of what 's on your plate . "
85336	85350	85351	85351	she	112	" He 'll be even more insulted if I throw it all up , "
85355	85363	85285	85285	he	54	" Maybe I 'd better not come . "
85364	85376	85377	85377	His	54	" Oh , come along , we 'll work something out . "
85390	85412	85413	85413	She	112	" Fm sorry , I do n't know why I do it , but I ca n't seem to help it . "
85427	85430	85432	85432	Duncan	54	" Oh , "
85434	85465	85466	85466	he	54	" you 're probably representative of modern youth , rebelling against the system ; though it is n't considered orthodox to begin with the digestive system . But why not ? "
85469	85507	85466	85466	he	54	" I 've always thought eating was a ridiculous activity anyway . I 'd get out of it myself if I could , though you 've got to do it to stay alive , they tell me . "
85517	85520	85521	85521	he	54	" Personally , "
85530	85557	85521	85521	he	54	" I 'd prefer to be fed through the main artery . If I only knew the right people I 'm sure it could be arranged .... "
85637	85658	85634	85634	she	112	" What am I doing ? I 'm getting married in a month . Why should n't they find out ? "
85669	85685	85666	85666	she	112	" But I 'll never see them again . Why complicate things at this point ? "
85749	85756	85757	85757	he	140	" T^ you two out there , "
85760	85786	85757	85757	he	140	" Do come in . Dinner'll be a few more minutes , I 'm afraid . I 'm so glad you could come , ah .... "
85797	85800	85801	85801	Duncan	54	" Marian , "
85805	85809	85811	85811	Trevor	91	" Oh yes , "
85813	85824	85811	85811	Trevor	91	" I do n't think we 've really met -formally . "
85836	85849	85850	85850	He	140	" You 're just getting pot - luck tonight - nothing fancy . "
86035	86044	86045	86045	Marian	112	" Thank you , this is very nice , "
86053	86059	86045	86045	Marian	112	" What a beautiful glass ! "
86060	86085	86086	86086	he	91	" Yes , is n't it elegant ? It 's been in the family for years . There 's r so little elegance left , "
86111	86136	86086	86086	he	91	" Especially in this country . I think we all ought to do our bit to preserve some of it , do n't you ? "
86185	86203	86173	86173	She	112	" Duncan tells me you 've been doing some work on Beatrix Potter . That sounds exciting . "
86204	86242	86243	86243	He	91	" Huh ? Oh yeah . I was contemplating it , but I 've got into Lewis Carroll , that 's really more profound . The nineteenth century is very hot property these days , you know . "
86271	86358	86256	86256	his	91	" Of course everybody knows Alice is a sexual - identity - crisis book , that 's old stuff , it 's been around for a long time , I 'd like to go into it a little 193 deeper though . What we have here , if you only look at it closely , ' - ' this is the little girl descending into the very suggestive rabbit- ; ~ burrow , becoming as it were pre - natal , trying to find her role , "
86365	86446	86362	86362	his	91	" her role as a Woman . Yes , well that 's clear enough . These patterns emerge . Patterns emerge . One sexual role after another is presented to her but she seems unable to acgept aay of them , I mean she 's really blocked . She rejectiTSatonity when the baby she 's been nursing turns into a pig , nor does she respond positively to the dominating - female role of the Queen and her castration cries of "
86452	86685	86724	86724	Duncan	54	" And when the Duchess makes a cleverly concealed lesbian pass at her , sometimes you wonder how conscious old Lewis was , anyway she 's neither aware nor interested ; and right after that you 'll recall she goes to talk with the Mock - Turtle , enclosed in his shell and his self - pity , a definitely pre - adolescent character ; then there are those most suggestive scenes , most suggestive , the one where her neck becomes elongated and she is accused of being a serpent , hostile to eggs , you 'll remember , a rather destructively - phallic identity she indignantly rejects ; and her negative reaction to the dictatorial Caterpillar , just six inches high , importantly perched on the all - too - female mushroom which is perfectly round but which has the power to make you either smaller or larger than normal , I find that particularly interesting . And of course there 's the obsession with time , clearly a cyclical rather than a linear obsession . So anyway she makes a lot of attempts but she refuses to commit herself , you ca n't say that by the end of the book she has reached anything that can be definitely called maturity . She does much better though in Through The Looking Glass , where , as you 'll remember .... "
86739	86799	86800	86800	he	91	" Has he been going on about those horrid symbols and things again ? I do n't approve of that kind of criticism myself , I think style 's so much more important , and Fischer gets much too Viennese , especially when he drinks . He 's very wicked . Besides , he 's so out 194 of date "
86804	86839	86800	86800	he	91	" The very latest approach to Aim is just to dismiss it as a rather charming children 's book . I 'm almost ready , Duncan could you just help me set the table ? "
86934	86938	86939	86939	Trevor	91	" There now ! "
86942	86948	86939	86939	Trevor	91	" Dinner will be served ! "
87024	87033	87034	87034	he	91	" You sit here , ah , Marian , "
87298	87309	87281	87281	his	91	" Your silverware is beautiful/ ' she said to Trevor . "
87316	87320	87281	87281	his	91	" he smiled . "
87354	87374	87334	87334	I	0	" Marian inspected the pattern . It was a burgeoning floral design with many scallops , flutings and scrolls . "
87377	87381	87334	87334	I	0	" she said . "
87393	87405	87382	87382	I	0	" Trevor beamed . She was obviously saying the right things . "
87442	87452	87453	87453	I	0	" He went on without waiting for an answer . "
87498	87761	87783	87783	they	1569	" He cocked his head to one side as though listening , then sprang out of his chair and pivoted round the corner into the kitchenette . Fischer , who had not said anything since they had sat down , now opened his mouth and began to speak . Since he continued to eat at the same time , the intake of food and the output of words made a rhythm , Marian commented to herself , much like breathing , and he seemed to be able to handle the alternation quite as automatically ; which was a good thing because she was sure that if he paused to think about it something would go down the . wrong way . It would be more than painful to have a shrimp caught in one 's windpipe ; especially with horse - radish sauce . She watched him , fascinated . She was able to stare openly because he had his eyes shut most of the time . His fork found its way to his mouth by some mechanism or sense peculiar to himself , she could n't imagine how : perhaps batlike supersonic radar - waves bounced back from the fork ; or perhaps his individual whiskers functioned like antennae . He did n't break his pace even when Trevor , who had been busily removing the shrimp - cocktail dishes , set his soup plate in front of him , though he opened his eyes long enough to pick up his soup - spoon after a preliminary trial with his fork . "
87769	87774	87775	87775	They	1569	" he had begun . "
88050	88226	88227	88227	You	1576	" They were having sherry with the soup . Fish groped for his sherry glass , almost upsetting it . Marian was now under cross - fire , since as soon as Trevor had sat down again he had begun to talk at her from the other side , telling her about the soup , which was clear and subtly flavoured : how he had extracted its essences , painstakingly , moment by moment , at a very low heat ; and since he was the only person at the table who was looking more or less at her she felt obliged to look at him in return . Duncan was n't paying any attention to anyone and neither Fish nor Trevor seemed at all disconcerted by the fact that both ofthem were talking at once . They were evidently used to it . She found however that she could manage by nodding and smiling from time to time and keeping her eyes riveted on Trevor and her ears on Fish , who was continuing , "
88296	88414	88419	88420	the poet	1578	" Trevor sprang up and dashed around the table , removing the soup plates . His voice and his gestures were becoming more and more accelerated ; he was popping in and out of the kitchen like the cuckoo in a cuckoo - clock . Marian glanced at Fish . Apparently he had missed several times with the soup : his beard was becoming glutinous with spilled food . He looked like a highchaired and bewhiskered baby ; Marian wished someone would tie a bib around his neck . Trevor made an entrance with clean plates , and another exit . She could hear him fidgeting about the kitchen , in the background of Fish 's voice : "
88457	88460	88452	88452	Apollo	146	" inspiration , "
88560	88595	88716	88716	I	0	" There was a fizzling sound , and Trevor appeared dramatically in the doorway , holding a flaming blue sword in either hand . Marian was the only person who even looked at him . "
88600	88605	88716	88716	I	0	" she said appreciatively . "
88612	88613	88716	88716	I	0	" "
88647	88710	88736	88736	they	1583	" When he dexterously slid whatever was impaled on the skewers onto her plate , she could see that most of it was meat . Well , now her back was to the wall . She would have to think of something . Trevor poured the wine , explaining how hard it was to find really fresh tarragon in this city . v^~ "
88792	88853	88758	88758	Malthus	144	" The other dishes contained rice with something in it , an aromatic sauce which went on the meat , and an unidentifiable vegetable . Trevor passed them round . Marian put some of the dark green vegetable substance into her mouth , tentatively , as one would make an offering to a possibly angry god . It was accepted . "
88958	89032	89035	89043	painters who splatter the paint all over the canvas	1589	" Trevor was in the kitchen again . Marian surveyed the chunks of meat on her plate with growing desperation . She thought of sliding them under the tablecloth - but they would be discovered . She would have been able to put them into her purse if only she had n't left it over by the chair . Perhaps she could slip them down the front of her blouse or up her sleeves "
89062	89160	89035	89043	painters who splatter the paint all over the canvas	1589	" She reached under the table with her foot and prodded Duncan gently on the shin . He started , and looked across at her . For a moment his eyes held no recognition whatsoever ; but then he watched , curious . She scraped most of the sauce from one of the hunks of meat , picked it up between thumb and finger , and tossed it to him over the candles . He caught it , put it on his plate , and began to cut it up . She started to scrape another piece . "
89208	89249	89035	89043	painters who splatter the paint all over the canvas	1589	" Marian flung the second chunk , which was also neatly caught . Maybe they should quickly exchange plates , she thought ; but no , that would be noticed , he had finished his before Trevor left the room . "
89257	89288	89251	89251	we	1591	" Fish was saying . His voice had become almost a chant , and was swelling in volume ; he seemed to be building up to some kind of crescendo . "
89410	89528	89531	89531	I	0	" Fischer decided to stand up , perhaps to give rhetorical emphasis to his last words . To lift himself he placed his hands on the card table , two of whose legs jacknifed , sending Fish 's plate slithering into his lap . At that moment the chunk of meat which Marian had just hurled was in mid - air ; it caught Duncan squarely in the side of the head , then deflected , bounced across the floor , and landed on a pile of term - papers . Trevor , a small salad dish in either hand , had stepped through the doorway just in time to witness both events . His jaw dropped . "
89540	89568	89531	89531	I	0	" Duncan said into the suddenly quiet room . He was gazing serenely at the ceiling , a whitish - grey trace of sauce in his hair . "
89572	89692	89531	89531	I	0	" Duncan had said he would walk her part way home : he needed a breath of fresh air . Luckily none of Trevor 's dishes had been broken , although several things had been spilled ; and when the table had been straightened and Fischer had subsided , muttering to himself , Trevor had gracefully dismissed the whole incident , though for the remainder 200 of the meal , through the salad and the pedes flambksand the coconut cookies and the coffee and liqueurs , his manner to Marian had been cooler . Now , crunching along the snowy street , they were discussing the fact that Fischer had eaten the slice of lemon out of his fingerbowl . "
89702	89706	89693	89693	Trevor	91	" Duncan said , "
89765	89766	89756	89756	I	0	" "
89776	89845	89756	89756	I	0	" Marian said . She was considering the total absence all evening of any reference to or question about herself , though she had assumed she was invited because the two room - mates wanted to know more about her . Now , however , she thought it more than likely that they were merely desperate for new audiences . Duncan looked at her with a sardonic smile . "
89860	89861	89849	89849	you	1606	" "
89867	89871	89849	89849	you	1606	" she suggested . "
89965	89966	89949	89949	they	1608	" "
89975	89976	89969	89969	you	0	" "
89983	89987	89979	89979	they	1608	" he said , "
90003	90071	89996	89997	a person	1611	" They had reached the top of the asphalt ramp that led down to the baseball park . Duncan sat down on the snow bank at one side and lit a cigarette ; he never seemed to mind the cold . After a moment she sat down beside him . Since he made no attempt to put his arm around her , she put hers around him . "
90076	90083	89996	89997	a person	1611	" he said after a while , "
90147	90162	90163	90163	I	0	" He threw the stub of his cigarette into the snow and lit another . "
90239	90254	90235	90235	you	1614	" Marian could n't resist this appeal . She knew she was n't woollen . "
90262	90268	90235	90235	you	1614	" she said , speculating . "
90278	90279	90269	90269	We	1615	" "
90288	90302	90281	90281	we	1615	" Duncan said , showing neither surprise nor glee at her implied acceptance . "
90314	90318	90281	90281	we	1615	" she said , "
90323	90324	90320	90321	married people	3205	" "
90331	90336	90325	90325	They	1620	" he said sadly . "
90356	90357	90343	90343	They	1620	" "
90366	90367	90368	90368	I	0	" "
90377	90389	90373	90373	I	0	" He turned his head and kissed her on the nose . "
90409	90410	90411	90411	You	0	" "
90430	90431	90423	90428	a - some kind of prostitute	1623	" "

90441	90449	90416	90416	you	0	" she said , a little indignantly . "
90456	90457	90458	90458	I	0	" "
90464	90472	90458	90458	I	0	" he said in a gloomy voice . "
90490	90496	90484	90484	I	0	" He lit another cigarette . "
90516	90523	90506	90506	you	0	" he said with mild bitterness , "
90529	90629	90525	90525	I	0	" Marian was looking out over the baseball park . The night was clear and crisp , and the stars in the black sky burnt coldly . It had snowed earlier , fine powdery snow , and the park was a white blank space , untracked . Suddenly she wanted to go down and run and jump in it , making footmarks and mazes and irregular paths . But she knew that in a minute she would be walking sedately as ever across it towards the station . 202 She stood up , brushing the snow from her coat . "
90634	90667	90525	90525	I	0	" she asked . Duncan stood up too and put his hands into his pockets . His face was shadowed in places and yellowed by the light from the feeble street lamp . "
90670	90674	90676	90676	you	1625	" he said . "
90680	91148	90676	90676	you	1625	" He turned away , his retreating figure blurring almost noiselessly into the blue darkness . When she had reached the bright pastel oblong of the subway station , Marian took out her change purse and retrieved her engagement ring from among the pennies , nickels and dimes . 2 ) Marian was resting on her stomach , eyes closed , an ashtray balanced in the hollow of her bare back where Peter had set it . He was lying beside her , having a cigarette and finishing his double scotch . In the living room the hi - fi set was playing cocktail music . Although she was keeping her forehead purposefully unwrinkled , she was worrying . That morning her body had finally put its foot down on canned rice pudding , after accepting it with scarcely a tremor for weeks . It had been such a comfort knowing she could rely on it : it provided bulk , and as Mrs. Withers the dietician had said , it was fortified . But all at once as she had poured the cream over it her eyes had seen it as a collection of small cocoons . Cocoons with miniature living creatures inside . Ever since this thing had started she had been trying to pretend there was nothing really wrong with her , it was a superficial ailment , like a rash : it would go away . But now she had to face up to it ; she had wondered whether she ought to talk to someone about it . She had already told Duncan , but that was no good^he seemedjto findjt^nojcmal , and what was essentially bothering her was the thought that she might not be normal . This was why she was afraid to tell Peter : he might think she was some kind of freak , or neurotic . Naturally he would have second thoughts about 203 getting married ; he might say they should postpone the wedding until she got over it . She would say that , too , if it was him . What she would do after they were married and she could n't conceal it from him any longer , she could n't imagine . Perhaps they could have separate meals . She was drinking her coffee and staring at her uneaten rice pudding when Ainsley came in , wearing her dingy green robe . These days she no longer hummed and knitted ; instead she had been reading a lot of books , trying , she said , to nip the problem in the bud . She assembled her ironized yeast , her wheat - germ , her orange juice , her special laxative and her enriched cereal on the table before sitting down . "
91151	91155	91157	91157	you	52	" Marian said , "
91163	91164	91157	91157	you	52	" "
91173	91178	91179	91179	Nobody	342	" Ainsley said cryptically . "
91183	91294	91157	91157	you	52	" She opened a paperback book and began to read , underlining with a red pencil . Ainsley would n't have been much help anyway . A couple of months ago she would have said it was something wrong with Marian 's sex life , which would have been ridiculous . Or some traumatic experience in her childhood , like finding a centipede in the salad or like Len and the baby chicken ; but as far as Marian knew there was n't anything like that in her past . She had never been a picky eater , she had beenjbrought up to eat whatever was on the plate ; she hadn't"even
91368	91386	91387	91387	Ainsley	52	" They say whatever causes the behaviour , it 's the behaviour itself that becomes the problem , "
91392	91454	91455	91455	she	52	" Of course there are still a few hitches . If the cause is deep - rooted enough , they simply switch their addiction , like from alcohol to dope ; or they commit suicide . And what I need is not a cure but a prevention . Even if they can cure him - if he wants to be cured , "
91459	91473	91455	91455	she	52	" he 'll still blame me for causing it in the first place . "
91767	91775	91776	91776	she	112	" I 'm so glad you came , "
91779	91808	91809	91809	she	112	" Joe 's down at the university . I 'll get out in a minute and make the tea . Elaine does n't like the play - pen , "
91812	91822	91809	91809	she	112	" and I 'm helping her get used to it.79 "
91829	91850	91823	91823	I	0	" Marian said ; she thought of Clara as a perpetual invalid and connected her with meals carried on trays . "
91857	91912	91823	91823	I	0	" It took her some time to find everything but at last she had the tray arranged , with tea and lemon and some digestive biscuits she had discovered in the laundry basket , and she carried it in and set it on the floor . She handed Clara her cup over the bars . "
91915	91936	91823	91823	I	0	" said Clara when Marian had settled herself on the rug , so as to be on the same level , "
91954	92069	91943	91943	you	1647	" Looking at her sitting in there with the baby chewing on the 205 buttons of her blouse , Marian found herself being envious of Clara for the first time in three years . Whatever was going to happen to Kj Clara had already happened : she had turned into what she was going to be . It was n't that she wanted to change places with Clara ; she only wanted to know what she was becoming , what direction she was taking , so she could be prepared . It was waking up in the morning one day and finding she had already changed without being aware of it that she dreaded . "
92072	92076	92078	92078	you	81	" she said , "
92083	92102	92078	92078	you	81	" Clara had known her a long time ; her opinion would be worth something . Clara considered . "
92112	92124	92105	92105	I	0	" she said , removing a button from Elaine 's mouth . "
92143	92173	92138	92138	I	0	" Marian was reassured . That was what she herself would have said . But if she was so normal , why had this thing chosen to attack her ? "
92182	92186	92187	92187	I	0	" she said . "

92231	92246	92247	92247	I	0	" She wondered whether Clara was paying as much attention as she ought to . "
92253	92257	92250	92250	you	81	" said Clara , "

92299	92306	92307	92307	I	0	" It was difficult to explain . "

92336	92342	92334	92334	Joe	82	" she added . ; . "
92343	92360	92361	92361	she	0	" You 'll get over it . Did you want to know anything about ... sex ? "
92375	92382	92383	92383	she	0	" No , not really thanks , "
92514	92517	92518	92518	she	112	" Peter , "
92521	92526	92518	92518	she	112	" am I normal ? "
92536	92552	92553	92553	She	112	" I 'd say from my limited experience that you 're marvellously normal , darling . "
92564	92571	92572	92572	Peter	53	" I could use another drink , "
92615	92633	92595	92595	She	112	" And while you 're up , flip over the record , that 's a good girl . "
92878	92886	92887	92887	she	112	" I 've brought you some cake , "
92915	92921	92922	92922	He	53	" Are n't you nice . "
92939	92948	92922	92922	He	53	" Are n't you going to eat it ? "
92956	92959	92960	92960	he	53	" Later , "
92963	92966	92960	92960	he	53	" later . "
92975	92991	92967	92967	He	53	" You 're a bit chilly , darling ; come here and be warmed up . "
93069	93077	93078	93078	he	53	" I really worked up an appetitite , "
93161	93166	93142	93142	He	53	" not quite so mousy "
93203	93210	93211	93211	she	112	" It 's you , dear , "
93913	93930	93899	93904	A blonde woman with enormous breasts	1673	" Girls ! Be Successful ! If you want to really Go Places , Develop Your Bust "
94063	94066	94067	94067	she	112	" Well , "
94076	94088	94067	94067	she	112	" it 's a little - um - extreme for me . "
94099	94112	94113	94113	he	1670	" Ah , but you should wear it this way more often , "
94127	94141	94113	94113	he	1670	" You should try new things . You should be daring , eh ? "
94260	94269	94270	94270	she	112	" Peter will probably like it . Anyway , "
94273	94281	94270	94270	she	112	" it will go with the dress . "
95043	95047	95030	95031	Another voice	1719	" Oh no , "
95125	95128	95129	95129	she	112	" Marian I "
95138	95164	95165	95165	she	112	" You 've got to come in here and talk to Len . You 've got to make him listen to reasonl \ like^your hair , "
95259	95263	95264	95264	Len	87	" My God I "
95268	95281	95264	95264	Len	87	" After all that , now she wants me to marry her ! "
95282	95304	95305	95305	Ainsley	52	" Well , what 's the matter with you anyway ! You do n't want a homosexual son , do you ? "
95308	95346	95305	95305	Ainsley	52	" Goddam it , I do n't want any son at all ! I did n't want it , you did it yourself , you should have it removed , there must be some kind of pill .... "
95347	95397	95398	95398	Ainsley	52	" That 's not the point , do n't be ridiculous , the point is of course I 'm going to have the baby ; but it should have the best circumstances , and it 's your responsibility to provide it with a father . A father - image . "
95418	95483	95412	95412	Len	87	" How much do they cost ? I 'll buy you one . Anything . But I 'm not going to marry you , dammit . Do n't give me that responsibility stuff either , I 'm not responsible anyway . It was all your doing , you deliberately allowed me to get myself drunk , you seduced me , you practically dragged me into "
95484	95494	95495	95495	Ainsley	52	" That is n't quite how I remember it , "
95498	95518	95519	95519	she	52	" and I was in a condition to remember it a lot more clearly than you can . Anyway , "
95525	95586	95519	95519	she	52	" you thought you were seducing me . And after all , that 's important too , is n't it : your motives . Suppose you really had been seducing me and I 'd got pregnant accidentally . What would you do then ? You 'd certainly be responsible then , would n't you ? So it is your responsibility . "
95601	95616	95617	95617	he	87	" You 're like all the rest of them , you 're a sophist , "
95618	95628	95519	95519	she	52	" 3 said in a quaveringly - savage voice . "
95656	95657	95646	95646	I	0	" "
95662	95670	95671	95671	You	87	" Ainsley said , her voice rising . "

95720	95737	95717	95717	she	112	" Could we please be a little less noisy ? The lady down below might hear . "
95738	95747	95748	95748	Len	87	" Oh , screw the lady down below ! "
95822	95836	95837	95837	he	87	" You and your goddamn fertility - worship can go straight to hell ! "
95864	95878	95879	95879	she	52	" Oh Len , come back and let 's talk it over seriously , "
96122	96148	96149	96149	he	87	" All you clawed scaly bloody predatory whoring fucking bitches can go straight to hell ! All of youl Underneath you 're all the same ! "
96171	96178	96179	96179	he	87	" You 'll never get me ! "
96278	96286	96264	96267	the lady down below	203	" The young man was obviously inebriated . "
96287	96290	96291	96291	Ainsley	52	" Well , "
96308	96315	96291	96291	Ainsley	52	" I guess that 's that . "
96333	96338	96339	96339	she	112	" What 's what ? "
96355	96398	96342	96342	Ainsley	52	" I do n't think he 's going to come round . It 's just as well : I doubt if he 'd make a very good one anyway . I 'll simply have to get another one , that 's all . "
96399	96406	96407	96407	Marian	112	" Yes ; I guess so , "
96683	96693	96694	96694	she	112	" Maybe I 'll have a cup of tea , "
96902	96905	96906	96906	she	112	" Disgraceful , "
97380	98354	98355	98355	Hullo	152	" 7 tub , to float with the water washing gently over her nearly - submerged body . From their elevated position her eyes had a long vista of white concave enclosing walls and semi - transparent water , her body islanded , extending in a series of curves and hollows down towards the terminal peninsula of legs and the reefs of toes ; and beyond that a wire rack with the soap dish , and then the taps . There were two taps , one for the hot and one for the cold . Each had a round bulb - shaped silver base and there was a third bulb in the middle with the spout where the water came out . She looked more closely : in each of the three silver globes she could see now that there was a curiously - sprawling pink thing . She sat up , stirring the water into minor tidal waves , to see what they were . It was a moment before she recognized , in the bulging and distorted forms , her own waterlogged body . She moved , and all three of the images moved also . They were not quite identical : the two on the outside were slanted inwards ^towards the third . How peculiar it was to see three reflections of ^yourself at the same SmeTsrie thought ; she swayed herself back and fortTiT^tching the way in which the different bright silver parts of her body suddenly bloated or diminished . She had almost forgotten that she was supposed to be taking a bath . She stretched one hand towards the taps , wanting to see it grow . There were footsteps outside the door . She had better get out : it must be the lady down below trying to get in . She began to splash off the remaining traces of soap . Looking down , she became aware of the water , which was covered with a film of calcinous hard - water particles of dirt and soap , and of the body that was sitting in it , somehow no longer quite her own . All at once she was afraid that she was dissolving , coming apart layer by layer like a piece of cardboard in a gutter puddle . She pulled the plug hastily and scrambled out of the tub . It was safer on the dry beach of the cold tiled floor . She slid her engagement ring back onto her finger , seeing the hard circle for a moment as a f^o|ectiveXaU§rnan^that^ould help keepjier together . But the panic was still with her as she climbed the stairs . She could not face the party , all those people , Peter 's friends were nice 218 enough but they did n't really know her , fixing their uncomprehending eyes on her , she was afraid of losing her shape , spreading out , not being able to contain herself any longer , beginning ( that would be worst of all ) to talk a lot , to tell everybody , to cry . She contemplated bleakly the festive red dress hanging in her closet . What can I do ? her mind kept thinking . She sat down on her bed . She remained sitting on the bed , gnawing idly on the end of one of her fringed dressing - gown ties , closed in a sodden formless unhappiness that seemed now to have been clogging her mind for a long time , how long she could not remember . With its weight pressing around her it was most improbable that she would ever manage to get up off the bed . I wonder what time it is ? she said to herself . I 've got to get ready . The two dolls which she had never thrown out after all were staring blankly back at her from the top of the dresser . As she looked at them their faces blurred , then re - formed , faintly malevolent . She was irritated with them for sitting there inertly on either side of the mirror , just watching her , not offering any practical suggestions . But now that she examined their faces more closely she could see > that it was only the dark one , the one with the peeling paint , that was definitely watching her . Perhaps the blonde one did n't even see her , the round blue eyes in its rubbery face were gazing straight through her . She substituted one of her fingers for the dressing - gown tie , biting at the side of her nail . Or perhaps it was a game , an agreement they had made . She saw herself in the mirror between them for an instant as though she was inside them , inside both of them at once , looking out : herself , a vague damp form in a rumpled dressing - gown , not quite focussed , the blonde eyes noting the arrangement of her hair , her bitten fingernails , the dark one looking deeper , at something she could not quite see , the two overlapping images drawing further and further away from each other ; the centre , whatever it was in the glass , the thing .. that , held themj^ogether , would soon be quite empty . By the strength of their separate visions they were trying to pull her apart . She could n't stay there any longer . She pushed herself off the bed and into the hallway , where she found herself crouching over 219 the telephone and dialing a number . There was ringing , then a click . She held her breath . "
98357	98363	98364	98364	Duncan	54	" said a sullen voice . "
98366	98371	98364	98364	Duncan	54	" she said tentatively . "
98376	98377	98374	98374	me	0	" "
98380	98386	98374	98374	me	0	" There was a pause . "
98413	98414	98387	98387	Duncan	54	" "
98432	98436	98437	98439	The whole family	1767	" he said . "
98441	98442	98437	98439	The whole family	1767	" "
98461	98462	98453	98453	you	54	" "

98490	98502	98484	98484	I	0	" she said with an intensity which was unfamiliar to her . "
98508	98512	98504	98504	you	54	" he said . "
98554	98555	98558	98558	you	54	" "
98560	98911	98558	98558	you	54	" she said gratefully , and gave him directions . When she had put down the phone she felt a lot better . So that was the answer , then : to make sure there were people at the party who really knew her . That would keep everything in the right perspective , she would be able to cope . . . . She dialled another number . She spent half an hour on the phone ; by that time she had rounded up a sufficient number of people . Clara and Joe were coming if they could get a baby - sitter , that made five counting the other three ; and the three office virgins . After their initial hesitations , caused she supposed by the lateness of the invitation , she had hooked the three firmly by saying that she had n't asked them before because she thought it was going to be mostly married people , but that several unescorted bachelors were coming , and could they do her the favour of coming along too ? Things got so dull for single men at couple - parties , she had added . That made eight altogether . As an afterthought she had asked Ainsley - it would be good for her to get out - and she accepted , surprisingly : it was n't her kind of party . 220 Although she considered it in passing , Marian did not think it would be a wise move to ask Leonard Slank . Now she was all right she could begin to dress . She oozed herself into the new girdle she had got to go with the dress , noting that she had n't really lost much weight : she had been eating a lot of noodles . She had n't intended to buy one at all , but the saleslady who was selling her the dress and who was thoroughly corseted herself said that she ought to , and produced an appropriate model with satin panelling and a bow of ribbon at the front . "
98956	98975	98954	98954	you	1770	" She had lifted her pencilled brows . At that time it had seemed like a moral issue . "
98982	98988	98989	98989	I	0	" Marian had said hastily , "
98994	99026	98989	98989	I	0	" When she had slithered into her red dress , she found she could n't reach behind far enough to do up the zipper . She knocked on Ainsley 's door . "
99034	99107	98989	98989	I	0	" she asked . Ainsley was in her slip . She had begun to put on her makeup , but thus far only one of her eyes had acquired its outline of black and her eyebrows had n't appeared at all , which made her face look unbalanced . After she had done up Marian 's zipper and the little hook at the top , she stood back and examined her critically . "
99114	99118	98989	98989	I	0	" she said , "
99129	99130	99122	99122	you	0	" "
99134	99135	99122	99122	you	0	" "
99161	99162	99163	99163	I	0	" "
99168	99221	99163	99163	I	0	" said Marian . She went into her own room and brought back the drawer that held the trinkets accumulated from her relatives . They were all variations of clustered imitation pearls and pastel arrangements of seashells and metal - and - glass flowers and cute animals . Ainsley pawed through them . "
99224	99237	99163	99163	I	0	" she said , with the decisiveness of someone who really knew . "
99254	99290	99243	99243	I	0	" After a search which involved much rustling in drawers and overturning of things on the bureau , she produced a couple of chunky dangly gold objects , which she screwed to Marian 's ears . "
99295	99299	99243	99243	I	0	" she said . "
99303	99315	99243	99243	I	0	" 221 Marian smiled , weakly . Ainsley shook her head . "
99321	99325	99243	99243	I	0	" she said , "
99374	99401	99402	99402	I	0	" She wadded Marian into her chair , which was lumpy with garments in progressive stages of dirtiness , and tucked a towel around her neck . "
99414	99426	99402	99402	I	0	" she said , adding while she began to file them , "
99435	99571	99429	99429	you	0	" When the nails had been painted a shimmering offwhite and Marian was holding her hands carefully in the air , she went to work on Marian 's face , using mixtures and instruments from the jumble of beauty - aids that covered her dressing - table . During the rest of the procedure , while strange things were being done to her skin , then to each eye and each eyebrow , Marian sat passively , marvelling at the professional efficiency with which Ainsley was manipulating her features . It reminded her of the mothers backstage at public - school plays , making up their precocious daughters . She had only a fleeting thought about germs . Finally Ainsley took a lipstick - brush and painted the mouth with several coats of glossy finish . "
99574	99588	99429	99429	you	0	" she said , holding a handmirror so that Marian could see herself . "
99604	99647	99649	99649	you	1773	" Marian stared into the egyptian - lidded and outlined and thicklyfringed eyes of a person she had never seen before . She was afraid even to blink , for fear that this applied face would crack and flake with the strain . "
99651	99656	99649	99649	you	1773	" she said doubtfully . "
99660	99670	99649	99649	you	1773	" said Ainsley . Marian smiled . Ainsley frowned . "
99674	99678	99679	99679	You	1774	" she said . "
99695	99899	99692	99692	your	1774	" Marian was embarrassed : she did n't know how . She was experimenting , looking in the mirror , trying to find out which particular set of muscles would produce the desired effect , and had just succeeded in getting an approximate droop that still however had a suggestion of squint in it , when they heard footsteps ascending the stairs ; and a moment later the lady down below stood in the doorway , breathing heavily . Marian removed the towel from her neck and stood up . Now that she had got her eyelids drooped she could not immediately get them undrooped again , back to their usual capable and level width . It was going to be impossible in this red dress and this face to behave with the ordinary matter - of - fact politeness that the situation was going to require . The lady down below gasped a little when she saw Marian 's new ensemble - bare arms and barish dress and well - covered face - but her real target was Ainsley , who stood bare - footed in her slip with one eye black - ringed and her auburn hair tendrilling over her shoulders . "
99903	99929	99900	99901	Miss Tewce	64	" the lady down below began . She was still wearing her tea - dress and her pearls : she was going to attempt dignity . "
99971	99997	99962	99962	I	0	" She was not at all calm : her voice was trembling . Marian noticed that she was clenching a lace handkerchief in one hand . "
100025	100049	100012	100012	I	0	" - her eyes flicked again over Marian 's dress ; her faith was somewhat shaken , but she let the comment pass - "
100163	100176	100151	100152	the child	202	" - she was shrilling now , in a vibrant accusing voice - "
100205	100220	100257	100258	a hypocrite	1783	" — -—-- Ainsley glared at her ; the black - rimmed eye flashed . "
100223	100249	100257	100258	a hypocrite	1783	" she said in an equally accusing voice , tossing back her hair and planting t.e.w.—8 lti her bare feet further apart on the floor , "
100394	100407	100408	100408	she	0	" The lady down below had turned quite pale . < cOh , "
100417	100427	100408	100408	she	0	" A baby ! Oh , oh , oh ! "
100446	100455	100457	100457	Marian	112	" I guess you 'll have to move , "
100512	100518	100519	100519	Ainsley	52	" Yes , of course , "
100539	100545	100546	100546	Marian	112	" That must be Peter , "
100549	100552	100546	100546	Marian	112	" already . "
100562	100598	100553	100553	She	112	" I 'm supposed to go over with him and help get things ready - I wish we could give you a ride , but I do n't think we 'll be able to wait . "
100599	100604	100606	100606	Ainsley	52	" That 's okay , "
100629	100666	100667	100667	Marian	112	" I 'll come on later . I 've got some things to do anyway . If it 's too cold for the baby I can always take a taxi , it is n't that far . "
101098	101137	101138	101138	Darling	131	" 5 building . Then they would turn the heat up to its full capacity ; as it was , the building , all except Peter 's place , was kept almost as cold as the outside air . "
101140	101168	101138	101138	Darling	131	" she said in a casual tone when they had reached the fifth floor and were pausing for a moment on the landing to catch their breath , "
101187	101373	101375	101375	you	1810	" All the way there in the car she had been pondering how she would tell him . It would not be a good thing for those people to arrive with Peter not knowing anything about it , though it had been a great temptation to say nothing , to rely on her ability to cope with the situation when the moment came . In the confusion she would not have to explain how she had come to invite them , she did n't want to explain , she could n't explain , and she dreaded questions from Peter about it . Suddenly she felt totally without her usual skill at calculating his reactions in advance . He had become an unknown quantity ; just after she had spoken , blind rage and blind ecstasy on his part seemed equally possible . She took a step away from him and gripped the railing with her free hand : there was no telling what he might do . But he only smiled down at her , a slight crease of concealed irritation appearing between his eyebrows . "
101420	101470	101375	101375	you	1810	" Marian was relieved . Now he had spoken she saw that it was exactly what he would have said . She was so pleased with him for answering predictably that she pressed his arm . He slid it around her waist , and they began to climb again . "
101473	101477	101375	101375	you	1810	" she said , "
101482	101505	101375	101375	you	1810	" Actually there were nine , but since he had been so polite about it she made the courteous gesture of minimizing . "
101510	101515	101375	101375	you	1810	" he asked pleasantly . "
101524	101535	101520	101520	Clara	81	" she said , her momentary elation beginning to vanish . "
101547	101548	101549	101549	My	0	" "
101553	101559	101551	101551	my	0	" he said , teasing , "
101606	101613	101631	101631	them	1814	" He kissed her ear genially . "
101616	101624	101631	101631	them	1814	" Marian said , with feeble cheerfulness . "
101633	101791	101628	101628	you	0	" Idiot , she raged at herself . Idiot , idiot . How could she have been so stupid ? She foresaw how it was going to be . The office % virgins would be all right - Peter would just look somewhat askance at them , particularly Emmy ; and Clara and Joe would be tolerated . But the others . Duncan would not give her away - or would he ? He might think it was funny to drop an insinuating remark ; or he might do it out of curiosity . She could take him aside when he arrived though and ask him not to . But the room - mates i were an insoluble problem . She did not think either of them knew yet that she was engaged , and she could picture Trevor 's shriek of surprise when he found out , the way he would glance at Duncan and say , "
101801	101928	101796	101796	we	1816	" and trail off into a silence weighted with innuendoes that would be even more dangerous than the truth . Peter would be furious , he would think someone v had been infringing on his private property rights , he would n't understand at all , and what would happen then ? Why in heaven 's name had she invited them ? What a colossal mistake ; how could she stop them from coming ? They reached the seventh floor and walked along the corridor towards the door of Peter 's apartment . He had spread several newspapers outside his door for people to put their overshoes and boots on . Marian took off her own boots and stood them neatly 1 beside Peter 's overshoes . "
101937	101941	101929	101929	I	0	" Peter said . "
101959	102019	101949	101949	I	0	" With no others beside them yet , the two pairs * * looked like black leathery bait in a large empty newspaper trap . ^ Inside , Peter took off her coat for her . He put his hands on her ^:UV ' i bare shoulders and kissed her lightly on the back of the neck . J P "
102022	102026	101949	101949	I	0	" he said , "
102030	102072	101949	101949	I	0	" Actually it was Ainsley's^.^^f - jjV'-^ an exotic mixture she had selected to go with the ear - rings . * '' * He took off his own coat and hung it up in the closet just inside the door . "
102082	102086	102080	102080	darling	434	" he said , "
102113	102518	102102	102102	Women	262	" 227 She walked across the living room floor . The only addition Peter had made to its furniture recently was another matching Danish - modern chair ; most of the space was still unoccupied . At least it meant that the guests would have to circulate : there was n't room for all of them to sit down . Peter 's friends did not , as a rule , sit on floors until rather late in the evening . Duncan might though . She imagined him crosslegged in the centre of the bare room , a cigarette stuck in his mouth , staring with gloomy incredulity perhaps at one of the soap - men or at one of the Danish - modern sofa legs while the other guests circled around him , not noticing him much but being careful not to step on him , as though he were a coffee table or a conversation - piece of some kind : a driftwoodand - parchment mobile . Maybe it was n't too late to phone them and ask them not to come . But the phone was in the kitchen and so was Peter . The bedroom was meticulously neat as always . The books and the guns were in their usual places ; four of Peter 's model ships now served as book - ends . Two of the cameras had been taken out of their cases and were standing on the desk . One of them had a flash - attachment on it with a blue flashbulb already clipped inside the silver saucer - shaped reflector . More of the blue bulbs were lying near an opened magazine . Marian placed her coat on the bed ; Peter had told her that the coat closet by the door would n't be large enough for all the coats and that the women were to put their coats n in his bedroom . Her coat then , lying with its arms at its sides , was \,v ' really more functional than it looked : it was acting as a sort of v - x a decoy for the other coats . By it they would see where they were y>- supposed to go . She turned , and saw herself reflected in the full - length mirror on the back of the cupboard door . Peter had been so surprised and pleased . "
102526	103023	102519	102519	Darling	131	" he had said as soon as he had come up through the stairwell . The implication had been that it would be most pleasant if she could arrange to look like that all the time . He had made her turn around so he could see the back , and he had liked that too . Now she wondered whether or not she did look absolutely marvellous . She turned the phrase over in her mind : it had no specific shape or flavour . What 228 should it feel like ? She smiled at herself . No , that would n't do . She smiled a different smile , drooping her eyelids ; that did n't quite work either . She turned her head and examined her profile out of the corner of her eye . The difficulty was that she could n't grasp the total effect : her attention caught on the various details , the things she was n't used to - the fingernails , the heavy ear - rings , the hair , the various parts of her face that Ainsley had added or altered . She was only able to see one thing at a time . What was it that lay beneath the surface these pieces were floating on , holding them all together ? She held both of her naked arms out towards the mirror . They were the only portion of her flesh that was without a cloth or nylon or leather or varnish covering , but in the glass even they looked fake , like soft pinkish - white rubber or plastic , boneless , flexible .... Annoyed with herself for slipping back towards her earlier panic , she opened the cupboard door to turn the mirror to the wall and found herself staring at Peter 's clothes . She had seen them often enough before , so there was no particular reason why she should stand , one hand on the edge of the door , gazing into the dark cupboard . . . . The clothes were hanging neatly in a row . She recognized all the costumes she had ever seen Peter wearing , except of course the dark winter suit he had on at the moment : there was his midsummer aspect , beside it his tweedy casual jacket that went with his grey flannels , and then the series of his other phases from late summer through fall . The matching shoes were lined up on the floor , each with its own personal shoe - tree inside . She realized that she was regarding the clothes with an emotion close to something like resentment . How could they hang there smugly asserting so much invisible silent authority ? But on second thought it was more like fear . She reached out a hand to touch them , and drew it back : she was almost afraid they would be warm . "
103030	103037	102519	102519	Darling	131	" Peter called from the kitchen . "
103042	103165	102519	102519	Darling	131	" she called back . She shut the cupboard door hastily , glanced into the mirror and patted one of her fronds back into place , and went to join him , walking carefully inside her finely - adjusted veneers . 229 The kitchen table was covered with glassware . Some of it was new : he must have bought it especially for the party . Well , they would always be able to use it after they were married . The counters held rows of bottles in different colours and sizes : scotch , rye , gin . Peter seemed to have everything well under control . He was giving some of the glasses a final polish with a clean teatowel . "
103173	103177	102519	102519	Darling	131	" she asked . "
103217	103267	103197	103197	I	0	" He himself had wasted no time ; his own glass was standing half - empty on the counter . She sipped at her drink , smiling at him over the rim . It was far too strong for her ; it burnt as it went down her throat . "
103278	103282	103270	103270	you	0	" she said . "
103289	103309	103270	103270	you	0	" She noticed with distaste that her mouth had left a greasy print on the rim of the glass . "
103319	103510	103270	103270	you	0	" he said , sounding pleased that she felt in need of dilution . The ice was in a large bowl . There was more in reserve , two polyethylene bags . The rest of the space was taken up by bottles , bottles of beer stacked on the bottom shelf , tall green bottles of gingerale and short colourless bottles of tonic water and soda on the shelves beside the freezing compartment . His refrigerator was so white and spotless and arranged ; she thought with guilt of her own . She busied herself with the potato chips and peanuts and olives and cocktail mushrooms , filling the bowls and platters that Peter had indicated , handling the foods with the very ends of her fingers so as not to get her nail - polish dirty . When she had almost finished Peter came up behind her . He put one arm around her waist . With the other hand he half - undid the zipper of her dress ; then he did it back up again . She could feel him breathing down the back of her neck . "
103523	103527	103529	103529	I	0	" he said , "
103550	103560	103561	103561	Peter	53	" He put his other arm around her waist . "
103563	103567	103569	103569	you	53	" she said , "
103573	103618	103569	103569	you	53	" She had asked him that 230 before as a kind of joke , not doubting the answer . But this time she waited , not moving , to hear what he would say . He kissed her lightly on the ear - ring . "
103630	103646	103623	103623	you	1827	" he said in a fond tone that indicated he thought he was humouring her . "
103675	103698	103668	103668	You	1827	" He let go of her , and she transferred the last of the pickled mushrooms from the bottle to the plate . "
103707	103760	103705	103705	darling	434	" his voice called . He was in the bedroom . She rinsed off her hands , dried them , and went to join him . He had switched on his desk lamp and was sitting at the desk adjusting one of his cameras . He looked up at her , smiling . "
103776	103780	103781	103781	They	1830	" he said . "
103823	103824	103825	103825	I	0	" "
103830	103834	103825	103825	I	0	" she said , "
103840	103841	103825	103825	I	0	" "
103857	103917	103848	103848	myself	0	" he said with a laugh . He began doing things to his light - meter . She leaned affectionately against his shoulder , glancing over it at the objects on the desk , the blue flashbulbs , the concave silver circle of the flashgun . He was consulting the open magazine ; he had marked the article entitled , "
103921	103946	104021	104021	they	1834	" . Beside the column of print there was an advertisement : a little girl with pigtails on a beach , clutching a spaniel . "
103951	104004	104005	104005	Darling	131	" the caption read . She walked over to the window and looked down . Below was the white city , its narrow streets and its cold winter lights . She was holding her drink in one of her hands ; she sipped at it . The ice tinkled against the glass . "
104007	104011	104005	104005	Darling	131	" Peter said , "
104093	104094	104095	104095	Peter	53	" "
104097	104102	104095	104095	Peter	53	" she said hesitantly , "
104111	104123	104103	104103	I	0	" The suggestion had made her unreasonably anxious . T.E.W.—8 * 231 "
104130	104134	104103	104103	I	0	" he said . "
104153	104213	104136	104136	you	131	" He turned the desk - lamp around so that the light was on her face and held the small black light - meter out towards her . She backed against the wall . He raised the camera and squinted through the tiny glass window at the top ; he was adjusting the lens , getting her in focus . "
104216	104220	104136	104136	you	131	" he said . "
104264	104328	104136	104136	you	131	" Her body had frozen , gone rigid . She could n't move , she could n't even move the muscles of her face as she stood and stared into the round glass lens pointing towards her , she wanted to tell him not to touch the shutter - release but she could n't move .... There was a knock at the door . "
104332	104344	104136	104136	you	131	" Peter said . He set the camera on the desk . "
104356	104388	104354	104354	darling	434	" He went out of the room . Marian came slowly from the corner . She was breathing quickly . She reached out one hand , forcing herself to touch it . "
104396	104402	104354	104354	darling	434	" she said to herself . "
104409	104616	104354	104354	darling	434	" 27 The first to arrive were the three office virgins , Lucy alone , Emmy and Millie almost simultaneously five minutes later . They were evidently not expecting to see each other there : each seemed annoyed that the others had been invited . Marian performed the introductions and led them to the bedroom , where their coats joined hers on the bed . Each of them said in a peculiar tone of voice that Marian should wear red more often . Each glanced at herself in the mirror , preening and straightening , before going out to the living room . Lucy refrosted her mouth and Emmy scratched hurriedly at her scalp . 23 z They lowered themselves carefully onto the Danish - modern furniture and Peter got them drinks . Lucy was in purple velvet , with silver eyelids and false lashes ; Emmy was in pink chiffon , faintly suggestive of high - school formals . Her hair had been sprayed into stiff wisps and her slip was showing . Millie was encased in pale blue satin which bulged in odd places ; she had a tiny sequin - covered evening - bag , and sounded the most nervous of the three . "
104626	105116	104617	104617	I	0	" Marian said . At that moment she was not at all glad . They were so excited . They were each expecting a version of Peter to walk miraculously through the door , drop to one knee and propose . What would they do when confronted with Fish and Trevor , not to mention Duncan ? Moreover , what would Fish and Trevor , not to mention Duncan , do when confronted with them } She pictured two trios of screams and a mass exodus , one set through the door and one through the window . What have I done now ? she thought . But she had almost ceased to believe in the existence of the three graduate students ; they were becoming more and more improbable as the evening and the scotch wore on . Maybe they would just never show up . The soap - men and their wives were filtering in . Peter had put a record on the hi - fi and the room was noisier and more crowded . Every time there was a knock on the door the three office virgins swivelled their heads towards the entrance ; and every time they saw another successful and glittering wife step into the room with her sleek husband , they turned back , a little more frantic , to their drinks and their interchange of strained comments . Emmy was fiddling with one of her rhinestone ear - rings . Millie picked at a loose sequin on her evening - bag . Marian , smiling and efficient , led each wife to the bedroom . The pile of coats grew higher . Peter got everybody drinks and had a number of them himself . The peanuts and potato chips and other things were circulating from hand to hand , from hand to mouth . Already the group in the living room was beginning to divide itself into the standard territories , wives on the sofa - side of the room , men on the hi - fi side , an invisible no - man's - land between . The office virgins had got stuck on the wrong side : they listened un- * 33 happily to the wives . Marian felt another pang of remorse . But she could n't attend to them right now , she thought : she was passing the pickled mushrooms . She wondered what was keeping Ainsley . The door opened again , and Clara and Joe walked into the room . Behind them was Leonard Slank . Marian 's nerves twitched , and one of the cocktail mushrooms fell from the plate she was carrying , bounced along the floor , and disappeared under the hi - fi set . She set down the plate . Peter was already greeting them , shaking Len 's hand effusively . His voice was getting louder with every drink . "
105139	105170	105130	105130	I	0	" he was saying . Len responded with a lurch and a glazed stare . Marian clamped her hand firmly on Clara 's coatsleeve and hustled her into the bedroom . "
105177	105190	105191	105191	I	0	" she asked , rather ungraciously . Clara took off her coat . "
105391	105392	105394	105394	he	1840	" "
105400	105405	105394	105394	he	1840	" Marian asked quickly . "
105409	105417	105418	105418	he	1840	" Clara said , raising her eyebrows , "
105426	105435	105436	105436	Marian	112	" ( tLet me get you a drink , "
105692	105698	105689	105689	Lucy	72	" Television ! How exciting 1 "
105732	105735	105736	105736	he	82	" Hi , "
105741	105764	105736	105736	he	82	" I 'm very glad you asked us here tonight . Clara has so few chances to get out of the house . "
105794	105805	105806	105806	Joe	82	" I worry about her a lot , you know , "
105809	105882	105806	105806	Joe	82	" I think ! it 's a lot harder for her than for most other women ; I think it 's harder for any woman who 's been to university . She gets the idea ; she has a mind , her professors pay attention to what she has to \ say , they treat her like a thinking human being ; when she gets I married , her core gets invaded .... "
105884	105888	105889	105889	Marian	112	" Her what ? "
105893	105919	105892	105892	I	0	" Her core . The centre of her personality , the thing she 's built kip ; her image of herself , if you like . "
105921	105926	105928	105928	Marian	112	" Oh . Yes , "
105931	105950	105928	105928	Marian	112	" Her ferninine role and her core are really in opposition , her feminine role demands passivity from her "
105983	106038	106039	106039	He	82	" So she allows her core to get taken over by the husband . And when the kids come , she wakes up one morning and discovers she does n't have anything left inside , she 's hollow , she does n't know who she is any more ; her core has been destroyed . "
106050	106071	106039	106039	He	82	" I can see it happening with my own female students . But it would be futile to warn them . "
106141	106153	106154	106154	Joe	82	" Of course it does n't help to realize all that , "
106158	106183	106154	106154	Joe	82	" It happens , whether you realize it or not . Maybe women should n't be allowed to go to university at all ; then "
106236	106347	106228	106228	she	81	" Marian looked up at Joe with an affection the precise flavour of which was blurred by the drinks she had had . She thought of him shuffling about the house in his undershirt , meditating on the life of the mind and doing the dishes and tearing the stamps raggedly off the envelopes ; she wondered what he did with the stamps after that . She wanted to reach out and touch him , reassure him , tell him Clara 's core had n't really been destroyed and everything would be all right ; she wanted to give him something . She thrust forward the plate she was holding . "
106352	106370	106228	106228	she	81	" she said . Behind Joe 's back the door was opened and Ainsley came through it . "
106374	106403	106228	106228	she	81	" Marian said to Joe . She set the olives on the hi - fi set and went over to intercept Ainsley ; she had to warn her . "
106406	106411	106228	106228	she	81	" Ainsley said breathlessly . "
106428	106455	106456	106456	Ainsley	52	" Marian hurried her into the bedroom , hoping that Len had n't seen her . She noted in passing that he was still fully enclosed . "
106458	106469	106456	106456	Ainsley	52	" she said when they were alone with the coats , "
106481	106550	106477	106477	he	87	" » } 6 Ainsley unswathed herself . She looked magnificent . She was dressed in a shade of green that bordered on turquoise , with eyelids and shoes to match ; her hair coiled and shone , swirled around her head . Her skin glowed , irradiated with many hormones ; her stomach was not yet noticeably bulbous . She studied herself in the mirror before answering . "
106553	106562	106477	106477	he	87	" she said calmly , widening her eyes . "
106610	106611	106601	106601	he	87	" "
106614	106618	106619	106619	he	87	" said Marian , "
106664	106666	106655	106655	you	1874	" y "
106674	106679	106655	106655	you	1874	" Ainsley said lightly , "
106689	106738	106655	106655	you	1874	" V x \ In the living room the soapmen on their side of the invisible < rr > fence were becoming quite boisterous . They gave forth bursts of , , v n laughter : one of them was telling dirty jokes . The women 's voices*Vv- < "
106765	106955	106956	106956	You	1875	" there was a general surge towards her : some of the soapmen predictably deserted their side and came to be introduced , and the corresponding wives , ever alert , rose from the sofa and took rapid steps to head them off at the pass . Ainsley smiled vacantly . Marian went into the kitchen to get a drink for Ainsley and another one for herself . The previous order of the kitchen , the neat rows of glasses and bottles , had disintegrated in the process of the evening . The sink was full of melting icecubes and shreds of food , people never seemed to know what to do with their olive - pits , and the pieces of a broken glass ; bottles were standing , empty and partially - empty , on the counters and the table and the top of the refrigerator ; and something unidentifiable had been spilled on the floor . But there were still some clean glasses . Marian filled one for Ainsley . As she was going out of the kitchen she heard voices in the bedroom . * 37 "
106967	107107	106761	106761	Ainsley	52	" It was Lucy 's voice . Marian glanced into the bedroom . Lucy was in there , gazing up at Peter from under her silver lids . He was standing with a camera in his hand grinning boyishly , though somewhat foolishly , down at her . So Lucy had abandoned the seige of Leonard . She must have realized it was futile , she had always been more astute about , those things than the other two . But how touching of her to try instead for Peter ; pathetic , actually . After all Peter was off the market almost as definitely as if he was already married . Marian smiled to herself and retreated , but not before Peter had spotted her and called , waving the camera , his face guiltily over - cheerful . "
107120	107139	106761	106761	Ainsley	52	" Lucy turned her head towards the doorway , smiling , her eyelids raising themselves like window shades . "
107147	107161	107145	107145	Ainsley	52	" Marian said , breaking through the circle of soapmen to hand it . "
107164	107336	107145	107145	Ainsley	52	" said Ainsley . She took it with a certain abstraction that Marian sensed as a danger - signal . She followed the direction of Ainsley 's gaze . Len was staring across the room towards them , his mouth slightly open . Millie and Emmy were still tenaciously holding him at bay . Millie had moved round to the front , blocking as much space with her wide skirt as possible and Emmy was sidestepping back and forth like a basketball guard ; but one of the flanks was unprotected . Marian looked back in time to see Ainsley smile : an inviting smile . There was a knock on the door . I 'd better get it , Marian thought , Peter 's busy in the bedroom . She opened the door and found herself confronting Trevor 's puzzled face . The other two were behind him , and an unfamiliar figure , probably female , in a baggy Harris - tweed coat , sunglasses and long black stockings . "
107343	107347	107350	107351	Peter Wollander	53	" Trevor asked . "
107353	107394	107350	107351	Peter Wollander	53	" He evidently did not recognize her . Marian blenched inwardly ; she had forgotten all about them . Oh well , there was so much noise and chaos in there anyway that Peter might not even notice them . 238 "
107405	107409	107397	107397	I	0	" she said . "
107422	107423	107420	107420	Marian	112	" "
107430	107434	107420	107420	Marian	112	" shrilled Trevor . "
107459	107518	107519	107519	You	0	" Trevor and Fish and the other one passed by her into the room , but Duncan remained outside . He took hold of her arm , tugged her into the hall , and closed the door behind her . He stood for a moment peering silently at her from under his hair , examining every new detail . "
107529	107535	107519	107519	You	0	" he said at last . "
107545	107564	107565	107565	You	0	" Marian let her shoulders sag with despair . So she did n't look absolutely marvellous after all . "
107575	107585	107565	107565	You	0	" she said weakly . Duncan began to snicker . "
107594	107598	107565	107565	You	0	" he said , "
107606	107607	107601	107601	you	0	" "
107612	107621	107601	107601	you	0	" she said with a trace of petulance , "
107630	107681	107601	107601	you	0	" He was very irritating . What did he expect her to wear , sackcloth and ashes ? She opened the door . The sound of talking and music and laughter swelled into the corridor . Then there was a bright flash of light , and a loud voice cried triumphantly "
107690	107691	107601	107601	you	0	" "
107696	107700	107701	107701	he	53	" Marian said , "
107707	107712	107701	107701	he	53	" Duncan stepped back . "
107724	107728	107717	107717	I	0	" he said . "
107747	107759	107740	107740	I	0	" It was suddenly very important that he come with her . "
107763	107767	107768	107768	I	0	" he said , "
107812	107813	107806	107806	I	0	" "
107815	107839	107740	107740	I	0	" she said . She was reaching for his arm , but already he was turning , almost running back down the corridor . "
107845	107852	107740	107740	I	0	" she called after him plaintively . "
107857	107862	107740	107740	I	0	" he called back . "
107872	107929	107930	107930	I	0	" he added . She caught a last glimpse of his twisted smile 239 as he rounded the corner . She could hear his footsteps retreating down the stairs . For an instant she wanted to run after him , to go with him : surely she could not face the crowded room again . But , "
107934	108101	108124	108124	she	112	" she said to herself . She walked back through the doorway . The first thing she encountered was Fischer Smythe 's broad woolly back . He was wearing an aggressively - casual striped turtleneck sweater . Trevor , standing beside him , was immaculately suited , shirted and tied . They were both talking to the creature in the black stockings : something about death - symbols . She sidestepped the group deftly , not wanting to be forced to account for Duncan 's disappearance . She discovered that she was standing behind Ainsley , and realized after a minute that Leonard Slank was on the other side of that rounded bluegreen form . She could n't see his face , Ainsley 's hair was in the way , but she recognized his arm and the hand holding the beer stein : freshly filled , she noted . Ainsley was saying something to him in a low urgent voice . She heard his slurred answer : "
108112	108116	108124	108124	she	112	" Alright then . "
108185	108196	108197	108197	She	52	" Len and I have a marvellous announcement to make . "
108206	108215	108202	108202	her	52	" We 're going to have a baby . "
108260	108269	108250	108250	Somebody	656	" Atta boy Len , whoever you are . "
108295	108300	108301	108301	he	155	" You rotten bitch I "
108360	108366	108367	108367	he	155	" That 's right folks , "
108370	108402	108367	108367	he	155	" and we 're going to have the christening right now , in the midst of this friendly little gathering . Baptism in utero . I hereby name it after me . "
108441	108444	108439	108440	the soapmenbellowed	1891	" Hey ! "
108469	108473	108474	108474	he	53	" Hold it I "
108480	108501	108474	108474	he	53	" Great ! That 'll be a great one ! Hey , this party 's really getting off the ground ! "
108691	108695	108696	108696	he	108	" Allow me , "
108701	108720	108696	108696	he	108	" we would n't want you to catch a chill , would we ? Not in your condition . "
108768	108777	108778	108778	she	52	" I do n't believe we 've met , "
108781	108791	108792	108792	he	108	" I think I already know who you are , "
109005	109014	109015	109015	she	112	" I 'm coping ! I 'm coping ! "
109803	109806	109807	109807	she	112	" No ! "
109818	109826	109810	109810	She	112	" What 's the matter , darling ? "
109851	109856	109857	109857	she	112	" It startled me , "
109860	109873	109874	109874	he	53	" You really ca n't hold your liquor , can you darling , "
109885	109901	109874	109874	he	53	" You should be used to it , I 've been taking pictures all evening . "
109902	109909	109910	109910	she	112	" Was that one of me ? "
109952	109992	109993	109993	He	53	" No , actually it was of Trigger over at the other side of the room . Never mind , I 'll get you later . But you 'd better not have another drink darling , you 're swaying . "
110303	110319	110297	110297	Peter	53	" Come on now , let 's get a group portrait . Everybody all together . "
110810	110815	110816	110816	she	112	" Take it easy , "
110819	110823	110816	110816	she	112	" keep calm . "
110870	110877	110878	110878	she	112	" You 'll be all right , "
110882	110895	110878	110878	she	112	" if only you can make it as far as the laundromat . "
111070	111073	111074	111074	she	112	" Duncan , "
111102	111107	111108	111108	she	112	" I 'm here , "
111145	111162	111116	111116	His	54	" Oh . So you are . The Scarlet Woman herself . What time is it ? "
111163	111169	111170	111170	she	112	" I do n't know , "
111173	111182	111170	111170	she	112	" I have n't got my watch on . "
111183	111199	111116	111116	His	54	" What 're you doing here ? You 're supposed to be at the party . "
111200	111209	111210	111210	she	112	" I could n't stay there any longer , "
111213	111222	111210	111210	she	112	" I had to come and find you . "
111223	111226	111227	111227	She	112	" Why ? "
111240	111250	111251	111251	He	54	" Because I just wanted to be with you . "
111264	111287	111251	111251	He	54	" Now listen , you should be back there . It 's your duty , what's - his - name needs you . "
111288	111299	111303	111303	she	112	" No , you need me more than he does . "
111320	111352	111317	111317	He	54	" No I do n't . You think I need to be rescued but I do n't . Anyway I do n't like being a test - case for amateur socialworkers . "
111376	111386	111387	111387	she	112	" But I 'm not trying to rescue you , "
111400	111431	111432	111432	He	54	" Then maybe you want me to rescue you ? What from ? I thought you had it all worked out . And you know I 'm totally inept anyway . "
111441	111451	111452	111452	Marian	112	" Oh , let 's not talk about rescuing , "
111456	111465	111452	111452	Marian	112	" Ca n't we just go some place ? "
111497	111504	111505	111505	he	54	" What 's wrong with here ? "
111508	111516	111505	111505	he	54	" I sort of like it here . "
111523	111531	111532	111532	she	112	" That is n't what I mean , "
111535	111538	111539	111539	he	54	" Oh , "
111542	111560	111539	111539	he	54	" Oh , that . You mean tonight 's the night , it 's now or never . "
111570	111584	111561	111561	He	54	" Well , we ca n't go to my place , you know . "
111585	111594	111616	111616	Peter	53	" We ca n't go to mine either . "
111617	111655	111561	111561	He	54	" We could stay here , it suggests interesting possibilities . Maybe * 47 inside one of the machines , we could hang your red dress over the window to keep out the dirty old men . ... "
111656	111672	111616	111616	Peter	53	" Oh come on/ ' she said , standing up . He stood up too . "
111697	111698	111699	111699	I	0	" "
111702	111706	111699	111699	I	0	" she said , "
111717	111752	111753	111753	You	1972	" She was vague about how they were going to get the thing accomplished , but tenaciously certain that it had to be done . It was the only way . Duncan smiled wickedly . "
111765	111769	111760	111760	you	1972	" he said . "
111791	111792	111782	111782	They	1974	" "
111798	111816	111793	111793	I	0	" she said . She reached up and began to unscrew one of the ear - rings . "
111825	111829	111830	111830	You	1972	" Duncan said . "
111839	111854	111830	111830	You	1972	" When they were outside on the street she had a sudden horrible thought . "
111858	111865	111830	111830	You	1972	" she said , standing still . "
111871	111872	111873	111873	I	0	" "
111880	111942	111943	111943	I	0	" Of course she had n't thought she would need any for the party . She had only her evening - bag with her , stuffed in a coat pocket . She felt the energy that had been propelling her through the streets , through this conversation , draining away . She was powerless , paralysed . She wanted to cry . "
111950	111954	111943	111943	I	0	" Duncan said . "
111963	111972	111943	111943	I	0	" He began to search through his pockets . "
111976	112040	111943	111943	I	0	" Into her cupped hands he piled a chocolate - bar , then several neatly folded silver chocolate - bar wrappers , a few white pumpkinseed shells , an empty cigarette package , a piece of grubby string tied in knots , a key - chain with two keys , a wad of chewing - gum wrapped in paper , and a shoelace . "
112044	112083	111943	111943	I	0	" he said . From his other pocket he pulled , in a cascade of small change that scattered over the sidewalk , a few crumpled bills . He picked up the change and counted all the money . "
112094	112098	111943	111943	I	0	" he said , "
112144	112174	112175	112175	I	0	" He put the money and the handfuls of junk back into his pocket . The subway was closed down , its iron latticed gate pulled across the entrance . "
112183	112187	112175	112175	I	0	" Marian said . "
112199	112412	112413	112413	I	0	" They turned at the next corner and walked south down the wide empty street , past the lighted storefronts . There were few cars and fewer people . It must be really late , she thought . She tried to imagine what was going on at the party - was it over ? Had Peter realized yet that she was no longer there ? - but all she could picture was a confusion of noises and voices and fragments of faces and flashes of bright light . She took Duncan 's hand . He was n't wearing gloves , so she put both his hand and her own into her pocket . He looked down at her then with an almost hostile expression , but he did not remove his hand . Neither of them spoke . It was getting colder and colder : her toes were beginning to ache . They walked for what seemed hours , gently downwards toward the frozen lake although they were nowhere near it , past blocks and blocks that contained nothing but tall brick office buildings and the vacant horizontal spaces of car - dealers , with their strings of coloured lights and little flags ; not what they were looking for at all . "
112422	112429	112413	112413	I	0	" Duncan said after a time . "
112436	112465	112413	112413	I	0	" They went along a dark narrow cross - street whose sidewalks were treacherous with packed snow and emerged finally on a larger street gaudy with neon signs . "
112472	112476	112413	112413	I	0	" said Duncan . "
112485	112521	112413	112413	I	0	" she asked , conscious of the plaintive tone in her own voice . She felt helpless to decide . He was moreor lejsjrixbarge . After aU , Jie was the one with the money . "
112535	112539	112540	112540	I	0	" he said . "
112547	112548	112540	112540	I	0	" "
112553	112558	112559	112559	I	0	" she said defensively . "
112566	112567	112559	112559	I	0	" "
112575	112579	112559	112559	I	0	" he said , "
112609	112615	112596	112596	We	1979	" He scanned the street . "
112628	112629	112596	112596	We	1979	" "
112641	112645	112596	112596	We	1979	" she wailed , "
112649	112650	112632	112632	I	0	" "
112678	112712	112653	112653	I	0	" He stopped in front of a narrow red £ rick building sandwiched between a formal - rental store with a gritjty bride in the window and a dusty - looking florist 's . "
112717	112736	112653	112653	I	0	" its dangling neon sign said ; underneath the writing J^iere was a coat - of - arms . "
112741	112758	112737	112737	You	1983	" Duncan said . He wej*c up the steps . He came back down the steps . "
112763	112801	112737	112737	You	1983	" he said . They walked on . The next one had a more promising aspect . It was dingier , and the stone grecian - scrolled cornices over the windows were dark - grey with soot . "
112806	112816	112737	112737	You	1983	" it said , in a red sign whose preliminary "
112818	112823	112653	112653	I	0	" had gone out . "
112827	112832	112833	112833	I	0	" It was open . "
112843	112951	112954	112954	he	1985	" she said . Her feet were freezing . Besides , she felt a need to be courageous : Duncan was coping so well , she ought to provide at least moral support . She stood on the dilapidated matting , trying to look respectable , and conscious of her ear - rings and of the improbability of the attempt . Duncan walked over to the night clerk , a wizened shred of a man who was staring at her suspiciously through his puckers . He and Duncan had a low - voiced conversation ; then Duncan came back and took her arm and they walked out . "
112957	112965	112966	112966	He	1985	" she asked when they were outside . "
112976	112977	112966	112966	He	1985	" "
112983	113001	112966	112966	He	1985	" she said . She was offended , and felt quite self - righteous . Duncan snickered . "
113005	113009	112954	112954	he	1985	" he said , "
113032	113094	112954	112954	he	1985	" They turned a corner and went east along a likely - looking street . They passed a few more shabby - genteel establishments before they came to one that was even shabbier , but definitely not genteel . In place of the crumbled brick facade characteristic of the others , it had pink stucco with large signs painted on it : "
113101	113107	112954	112954	he	1985	" 250 bargain in town . "
113120	113122	113175	113175	he	3571	" men "

113155	113162	113164	113164	Duncan	54	" I think this is it , "
113181	113191	113192	113192	he	3571	" Sort of late buddy , is n't it ? "
113195	113201	113175	113175	he	3571	" That 'll be four . "
113202	113206	113207	113207	Duncan	54	" Better late , "
113210	113214	113215	113215	He	54	" than never . "
113430	113439	113440	113440	he	54	" Well , what do we do now ? "
113443	113448	113440	113440	he	54	" You must know . "
113571	113575	113577	113577	Duncan	54	" Oh boy , "
113609	113614	113586	113586	He	54	" It 's genuine . "
113631	113668	113586	113586	He	54	" It says A Gift From Burk 's Falls on it,'9 he told her with glee . He turned it over to look on the bottom and some ashes fell out of it onto the floor . "
113673	113690	113586	113586	He	54	" he announced . Marian felt a surge of desperation . Something had to be done . "
113693	113697	113586	113586	He	54	" she said , "
113718	113728	113586	113586	He	54	" Duncan hung his head like a rebuked child . "
113734	113881	113586	113586	He	54	" he said . He shed his clothes with such velocity that it looked as though he had concealed zippers somewhere , or one long zipper so his clothes came off together dike a^single skin . He tossed them in a heap onto the chair and scuttled with alacrity into the bed and lay with the sheets pulled up around his chin , watching her with barely disguised and only slightly friendly curiosity . With tight - lipped determination she began to undress . It was somewhat difficult to wisp off her stockings in reckless abandon or even a reasonable facsimile of it with those two eyes goggling at her in such a frog - like manner from over the top of the sheet . She scrabbled with her fingers for the zipper at the back of her dress . She could not quite reach it . "
113885	113910	113586	113586	He	54	" she said tersely . He complied . She threw the dress over the back of the chair and struggled out of her girdle . "
113913	113917	113918	113920	A real one	2001	" he said . "
113953	113982	113948	113948	I	0	" She handed it over to him . He sat up in bed to examine it , stretching it all of its three ways and flexing the bones . "
113988	113992	113948	113948	I	0	" he said . "
114009	114033	114154	114154	she	0	" He spoke of it as though it was some kind of unpleasant but necessary surgical appliance : a brace or a truss . "
114036	114150	114154	114154	she	0	" she said . She was standing in her slip , wondering what to do next . She refused , somewhat prudishly she supposed , to undress the rest of the way with the lights on ; but he seemed to be having such a good time at the moment that she did n't want to interrupt . 252 On the other hand the room was cold and she was beginning to shiver . She walked doggedly towards the bed , gritting her teeth . It was x an assignment that was going to take a lot of perseverance . If she had had any sleeves on she would have rolled them up . "
114176	114180	114181	114181	he	54	" Oh no , "
114184	114235	114181	114181	he	54	" I 'm not letting you into this bed until you go in there and peel that junk off your face . Fornication may be all very well in its way , but if I 'm going to come out looking like a piece of flowered wallpaper I reject it . "
114268	114283	114284	114284	Duncan	54	" I guess now I 'm supposed to crush you in my manly arms , "
114311	114316	114317	114317	he	54	" You smell funny , "
114327	114346	114324	114324	Duncan	54	" It 's no use . I must be incorruptible . I 'm going to have a cigarette . "
114416	114426	114427	114427	he	54	" I do n't exactly know what 's wrong , "
114430	114487	114488	114488	he	54	" Partly I do n't like not being able to see your face ; but it would probably be worse if I could . But it 's not just that , I feel like some kind of little stunted creature crawling over the surface of a huge mass of flesh . Not that you 're fat , "
114491	114510	114488	114488	he	54	" you are n't . There 's just altogether too much flesh around here . It 's suffocating . "
114523	114528	114529	114529	he	54	" That 's better , "
114838	114842	114843	114843	he	54	" Lie down , "
114870	114873	114874	114874	he	54	" No , "
114877	114904	114874	114874	he	54	" you have to unbend . Assuming the foetal position wo n't be any help at all , god knows I 've tried it long enough . "
114926	114938	114939	114939	he	54	" It is n't something you can dispense , you know , "
114942	114953	114939	114939	he	54	" You have to let me take my own time . "
115276	115279	115252	115252	She	2015	" Breakfast Suggestions "
115436	115444	115445	115445	he	54	" Let 's get out of here , "
115480	115495	115496	115496	he	54	" I 'm hungry . Let 's go for breakfast . You look awful , "
115500	115511	115512	115512	she	112	" You 're not exactly the picture of health yourself , "
115906	115917	115899	115899	She	112	" Bacon and Eggs , Any Style/ * she read . "
115923	115935	115899	115899	She	112	" She thought of pigs and chickens . She shifted hastily to "
115938	115950	115899	115899	She	112	" Something moved in her throat . She closed the menu . "
115956	115960	115899	115899	She	112	" Duncan asked . "
115969	115973	115963	115963	I	0	" she said , "
115990	116040	116041	116041	You	112	" It had finally happened at last then . Ue^odjl^c^it^J^^The food circle had dwindled to a point , a black dot , closing everything outside . . . . She looked at the grease - spot on the cover of the menu , almost whimpering with self - pity . "
116048	116057	116041	116041	You	112	" said Duncan with a trace of alacrity , "
116068	116136	116060	116060	I	0	" When the waitress came back he ordered ham and eggs , which he proceeded to consume voraciously , and without apology or comment , before her very eyes . She watched him in misery . When he broke the eggs with his fork and their yellow centres ran viscously over the plate she turned her head away . She thought she was going to be sick . "
116139	116157	116060	116060	I	0	" he said when he had paid the cheque and they were standing outside on the street , "
116177	116255	116256	116256	Duncan	54	" Marian thought of the cold fuel - oil and stale cigar smell there would be inside the bus . Then she thought of the dishes in the kitchen sink . The bus would get warm and stuffy as she travelled inside it along the highway , the tires making their high grinding whine . What was living , hidden and repulsive , down there among the plates and dirty glasses ? She could n't go back . "
116258	116262	116256	116256	Duncan	54	" she said , "
116268	116269	116256	116256	Duncan	54	" "
116276	116277	116278	116278	I	0	" "
116284	116291	116278	116278	I	0	" He frowned down at her . "
116300	116304	116305	116305	You	2021	" he asked . "
116334	116335	116336	116336	You	2021	" "
116348	116351	116346	116346	you	2021	" * 57 "
116354	116359	116360	116360	I	0	" he said , . "
116411	116429	116430	116430	I	0	" She looked down at their four feet , standing in the trodden slush of the sidewalk . "
116437	116445	116430	116430	I	0	" He peered at her more closely . "
116453	116457	116430	116430	I	0	" he asked . "
116463	116492	116430	116430	I	0	" She stood mutely before him . She could offer him no good reason for staying with her . There was no reason : what would it accomplish ? "
116495	116501	116430	116430	I	0	" he said , hesitating , "
116513	116522	116523	116523	We	2023	" She nodded gratefully . They walked north . "
116534	116538	116539	116539	They	2025	" he said . "
116545	116546	116547	116547	I	0	" "
116550	116551	116547	116547	I	0	" "
116560	116583	116584	116584	I	0	" he asked . She had n't thought about that . Everything was impossible . She put her hands over her ears . "
116589	116599	116584	116584	I	0	" she said , her voice rising towards hysteria , "
116611	116612	116584	116584	I	0	" "
116617	116622	116584	116584	I	0	" he said genially , "
116633	116643	116626	116626	We	2023	" He pulled her hands away from her ears . "
116647	116775	116626	116626	We	2023	" she said , letting herself be humoured . As they walked Duncan swung their linked hands back and forth . His mood seemed to have changed from its breakfast sullenness to a certain vacant contentment . They were going uphill , away from the lake ; the sidewalks were crowded with furred Saturday ladies trudging inexorably as icebreakers through the slush , brows furrowed with purpose , eyes glinting , shopping bags hung at either side to give them ballast . Marian and Duncan dodged past and around them , breaking hands when an especially threatening one bore down upon them . In the streets the cars fumed and splattered by . Pieces of soot fell from the grey air , heavy and moist as snowflakes . "
116782	116796	116776	116776	I	0	" Duncan said when they had walked wordlessly for twenty minutes or so . "
116819	116867	116584	116584	I	0	" Marian nodded . The further away , she thought , the better . They went down the nearest pastel - tiled chute , and after an interval smelling of damp wool and mothballs let themselves be carried up by the escalator and out again into daylight . "
116874	117014	116584	116584	I	0	" Duncan said . He seemed to know where he was going , for which Marian could only be thankful . He was leading her . He was in control^ On the streetcar they had to stand . Marian held on to one of the metal poles and stooped so she could see out the window . Over the top of a tea - cosy - shaped green and orange wool hat with large gold sequins sewed to it an unfamiliar landscape jolted past : stores first , then houses , then a bridge , then more houses . She had no idea what part of the city they were in . Duncan reached over her head and pulled the cord . The streetcar ground to a halt and they squeezed their way towards the back and jumped down . "
117019	117224	117016	117016	we	2029	" said Duncan . He turned down a side street . The houses were smaller and a little newer than the ones in Marian 's district , but they were still dark and tall , many with square pillared wooden porches , the paint grey or dingy white . The snow on the lawns was fresher here . They passed an old man shovelling a walk , the scrape of the shovel sounding strangely loud in the silent air . There was an abnormal number of cats . Marian thought of how the street would smell in the spring when the snow melted : earth , bulbs coming up , damp wood , last year 's leaves rotting , the winter 's accumulations of the cats who had thought they were being so clean and furtive as they scratched holes for themselves in the snow . Old people coming out of the grey doors with shovels , creaking over the lawns , burying things . Spring cleaning : a sense of purpose . They crossed a street and began to go down a steep hill . All at once Duncan started to run , dragging Marian behind him as if she was a toboggan . "
117227	117240	117016	117016	we	2029	" she called , alarmed at the loudness of her own voice . "
117246	117273	117241	117241	I	0	" She felt the curtains in all the windows swaying perilously as they went past , as though each house contained a dour watcher . * 59 "
117276	117283	117241	117241	I	0	" Duncan shouted back at her . "
117291	117351	117016	117016	we	2029	" Under her arm a seam split . She had a vision of the red dress disintegrating in mid - air , falling in little scraps behind her in the snow , like feathers . They were off the sidewalk now , slithering down the road towards a fence ; there was a yellow and black chequered sign that said "
117354	117499	117016	117016	we	2029	" She was afraid they would go splintering through the wooden fence and hurtle over an unseen edge , in slow motion almost , like movies of automobiles falling off cliffs , but at the last minute Duncan swerved around the end of the fence and they were on a narrow cinder path between high banks . The footbridge at the bottom of the hill came rapidly towards them ; he stopped suddenly and she skidded , colliding . Her lungs hurt : she was dizzy from too much air . They were leaning against a cement wall , one of the sides of the bridge . Marian put her arms on the top and rested . Level with her eyes there were tree - tops , a maze of branches , the ends already pale yellow , pale red , knotted with buds . "
117506	117516	117517	117517	We	2031	" Duncan said . He tugged at her arm . "
117521	117599	117517	117517	We	2031	" He led her to the end of the bridge . At one side was an unofficial path : the imprints of feet , a muddy track . They climbed down gingerly , their feet sideways like children learning to go down stairs , step by step . Water was dripping on them from the icicles on the underside of the bridge . When they had reached the bottom and were standing on level ground Marian asked , "
117605	117606	117824	117824	he	2033	" "
117610	117815	117824	117824	he	2033	" said Duncan . He began to walk away from the bridge . Marian hoped they were going to a place where they could sit down . They were in one of the ravines that fissured the city , but which one she did n't know . She had gone for walks close to the one that was visible from their living room window , but nothing she saw around her was familiar . The ravine was narrow here and deep , closed in by trees which looked as though they were pinning the covering of snow to the steep sides . Far above , towards the rim , some children were playing . Marian could see their bright jackets , red and blue , and hear their faint laughter . They were going single file along a track in the crusted snow . 260 S9mej3the£people hadjwalked there^ but not manj . At intervals she noticed what she thought wereThe marks of horses ' hooves . All she could see of Duncan was his slouched back and his feet lifting and setting down . » She wished he would turn around so she could see his face ; his expressionless coat made her uneasy . "
117996	118005	118006	118006	Duncan	54	" I like it down here in winter , "
118014	118168	118006	118006	Duncan	54	" Before I 've only been down here in summer . Everything grows , it 's so thick with green leaves and stuff you ca n't see three feet in front of you , some of it 's poison - ivy . And it 's populated . The old drunks come down here and sleep under the bridges and the kids play here too . There 's a riding - stable down here somewhere , I think what we 're on is one of the bridle - paths . I used to come down because it was cooler . But it 's better covered with snow . It hides the junk . They 're beginning to fill this place up with junk too , you know , beginning with the creek , I wonder why they like throwing things around all over the landscape . . . old tires , tin cans . ... "
118246	118251	118252	118252	Duncan	54	" Here we are , "
118368	118373	118374	118374	she	2045	" What is it ? "
118377	118384	118385	118385	Duncan	54	" It 's only the brickworks , "
118388	118408	118385	118385	Duncan	54	" That 's pure clay down there . They go down that road with steamshovels and dig it out . "
118409	118423	118424	118424	she	2045	" I did n't know there was anything like that in the ravines , "
118495	118515	118516	118516	Duncan	54	" Oh , they have lots of good things . There 's a prison down here somewhere , too . "
118574	118582	118583	118583	Marian	112	" I wonder what time it is , "
118671	118677	118678	118678	he	54	" You 'll get cold , "
118681	118690	118678	118678	he	54	" but go ahead if you want to . "
118742	118770	118736	118736	Duncan	54	" So why ca n't you go back ? I mean , you are getting married and so on . I thought you were the capable type . "
118771	118775	118776	118776	she	112	" I am , "
118780	118789	118776	118776	she	112	" I was . I do n't know . "
118798	118812	118790	118790	She	112	" Some would say of course that it 's all in your mind . "
118813	118818	118819	118819	she	112	" I know that , "
118832	118841	118819	118819	she	112	" But how do I get it out ? "
118842	118849	118850	118850	Duncan	54	" It ought to be obvious , "
118855	118912	118850	118850	Duncan	54	" that I 'm the last person to ask . They tell me I live in a world of fantasies . But at least mine are more or less my own , I choose them and I sort of like them , some of the time . But you do n't seem too happy with yours . "
118913	118921	118922	118922	she	112	" Maybe I should see a psychiatrist , "
118926	118943	118922	118922	she	112	" Oh no , do n't do that . They 'd only want to adjust you . "
118944	118967	118850	118850	Duncan	54	" But I want to be adjusted , that 's just it . I do n't see any point in being unstable . "
119071	119080	119081	119081	she	112	" How was it for you last night ? "
119093	119102	119084	119084	He	54	" How was what ? Oh . That . "
119133	119205	119130	119130	he	54	" I like this place . Especially now in winter , it 's so close to absolute zero . It makes me feel human . By comparison . I would n't like tropical islands at all , they would be too fleshy , I 'd always be wondering whether I was a walking vegetable or a giant amphibian . But in the snow you 're as near as possible to nothing . "
119222	119236	119237	119237	he	54	" You want me to say it was stupendous , do n't you ? "
119240	119260	119237	119237	he	54	" That it got me out of my shell . Hatched me into manhood . Solved all my problems . "
119261	119265	119130	119130	he	54	" Well ... . "
119266	119312	119237	119237	he	54	" Sure you do , and I could always tell you would . I like people participating in my fantasy life and I 'm usually willing to participate in theirs , up to a point . It was fine ; just as good as usual . "
119444	119453	119454	119454	she	112	" All right , that was your joke , "
119469	119483	119484	119484	He	2062	" Now I 've got to decide what I 'm going to do . "
119489	119549	119550	119550	He	2062	" Do n't ask me , that 's your problem . It does look as though you ought to do something : self - laceration in a vacuum eventually gets rather boring . But it 's your own personal cul - de - sac , you invented it , you 'll have to think of your own way out . "
119584	119587	119588	119588	she	112	" Duncan , "
119591	119628	119588	119588	she	112	" could you maybe come back with me and talk to Peter ? I do n't think I can do it , I do n't know what to say , he 's not going to understand .... "
119629	119633	119634	119634	he	2062	" Oh no , "
119637	119666	119667	119667	He	2062	" you ca n't do that . I 'm not part of that . It would be disastrous , do n't you see ? I mean for me . "
119682	119685	119686	119686	she	112	" Please , "
119695	119698	119699	119699	he	2062	" No , "
119702	119709	119699	119699	he	2062	" it would n't be right . "
119750	119757	119729	119729	he	2062	" Come here/ ' he said , "
119767	119818	119758	119758	I	0	" He led her further along . They came to a road which rose and then dipped . Below was a giant expressway , sloping up , and in the distance another bridge , a familiar bridge with subway cars moving on it . Now she knew where she was . "
119829	119833	119758	119758	I	0	" she asked . "
119853	119964	119847	119847	you	2062	" The tone of his voice closed her out . He turned and started to walk away . The cars rocketed past . She looked back once when she had trudged halfway up the hillside towards the bridge . She almost expected him to have evaporated into the white expanse of the ravine , but he was still there , a dark shape against the snow , crouched on the edge and gazing into the empty pit . 30 Marian had just got home and was struggling with her wrinkled dress , trying to get the zipper undone , when the phone rang . She knew who it would be . "
119967	119979	119980	119980	Marian	112	" she said . Peter 's voice was icy with anger . "
119995	120002	119989	119989	I	0	" He sounded hung - over . "
120005	120012	119989	119989	I	0	" she said with airy casualness , "
120023	120028	120013	120013	I	0	" He lost control . "
120147	120175	120176	120176	Peter	53	" I 'll bet it is , Marian thought with a momentary twinge of jealousy , remembering Lucy 's silver eyelids ; but out loud she said , "
120219	120220	120223	120223	you	0	" "
120228	120232	120223	120223	you	0	" he said . "
120317	120330	120311	120311	I	0	" Oh yes , she thought ; she had forgotten about that . "
120339	120343	120311	120311	I	0	" she said . "
120405	120406	120398	120398	he	91	" "
120411	120415	120409	120409	Peter	53	" she said , "
120428	120459	120409	120409	Peter	53	" She had a sudden desire to tell him the whole story , but what good would that do since nothing had been proved or accomplished ? Instead she said , "
120465	120466	120409	120409	Peter	53	" "
120471	120487	120409	120409	Peter	53	" he said , his voice surprised into neutrality by this appeal to simple fact . "
120516	120554	120409	120409	Peter	53	" She made her voice sweet , conciliatory . She was conscious of her own craftiness . Though she had n't made any decisions she could feel she was about to make one and she needed time . "
120560	120565	120409	120409	Peter	53	" he said peevishly , "
120572	122195	122196	122196	You	2081	" They hung up together . Marian went into the bedroom and took off her clothes ; then she went downstairs and took a quick bath . The lower regions were silent ; the lady down below was probably brooding in her dark den 266 or praying for the swift destruction of Ainsley by heavenly thunderbolts . In a spirit approaching gay rebellion Marian neglected to erase her bath - tub ring . What she needed was something that avoided words , she did n't want to get tangled up in a discussion . Some way she could know what was real : a test , simple and direct as litmus - paper . She finished dressing - a plain grey wool would be appropriate - and put on her coat , then located her everyday purse and counted the money . She went out to the kitchen and sat down at the table to make herself a list , but threw down the pencil after she had written several words . She knew what she needed to get . In the supermarket she went methodically up and down the aisles , relentlessly out - manoeuvring the muskrat - furred ladies , edging the Saturday children to the curb , picking the things off the shelves . Her image was taking shape . Eggs . Flour . Lemons for the flavour . Sugar , icing - sugar , vanilla , salt , food - colouring . She wanted everything new , she did n't want to use anything that was already in the house . Chocolate - no , cocoa , that would be better . A glass tube full of round silver decorations . Three nesting plastic bowls , teaspoons , aluminium cake - decorator and a cake tin . Lucky , she thought , they sell almost everything in supermarkets these days . She started back towards the apartment , carrying her paper bag . Sponge or angel - food ? she wondered . She decided on sponge . It was more fitting . She turned on the oven . That was one part of the kitchen that had not been over - run by the creeping skin - disease - covering of dirt , mostly because they had n't been using it much recently . She tied on an apron and rinsed the new bowls and the other new utensils under the tap , but did not disturb any of the dirty dishes . Later for them . Eight now she did n't have time . She dried the things and began to crack and separate the eggs , hardly thinking , concentrating all her attention on the movements of her hands , and then when she was beating and sifting and folding , on the relative times and the textures . Spongecake needed a light hand . She poured the batter into the tin and drew a fork sideways through it to i67 break the large air - bubbles . As she slid the tin into the oven she almost hummed with pleasure . It was a long time since she had made a cake . While the cake was in the oven baking she re - washed the bowls and mixed the icing . An ordinary butter icing , that would be the best . Then she divided the icing into three parts in the three bowls . The largest portion she left white , the next one she tinted a bright pink , almost red , with the red food - colouring she had bought , and the last one she made dark brown by stirring cocoa into it . What am I going to put her on ? she thought when she had finished . I 'll have to wash a dish . She unearthed a long platter from the very bottom of the stack of plates in the sink and scoured it thoroughly under the tap . It took quite a lot of detergent to get the scum off . She tested the cake ; it was done . She took it out of the oven and turned it upside - down to cool . She was glad Ainsley was n't home : she did n't want any interference with what she was going to do . In fact it did n't look as though Ainsley had been home at all . There was no sign of her green dress . In her room a suitcase was lying open on the bed where she must have left it the night before . Some of the surface flotsam was eddying into it , as though drawn by a vortex . Marian wondered in passing how Ainsley was ever going to cram the random contents of the room into anything as limited and rectilineal as a set of suitcases . While the cake was cooling she went into the bedroom and tidied her hair , pulling it back and pinning it to get rid of the remains of the hairdresser 's convolutions . She felt lightheaded , almost dizzy : it must be the lack of sleep and the lack of food . She grinned into the mirror , showing her teeth . The cake was n't cooling quickly enough . She refused to put it into the refrigerator though . It would pick up the smells . She took it out of the tin and set it on the clean platter , opened the kitchen window , and stuck it out on the snowy sill . She knew what happened to cakes that were iced warm - everything melted . She wondered what time it was . Her watch was still on the top of the dresser where she had left it the day before but it had run down . She did n't want to turn on Ainsley 's transistor , that would 268 be too distracting . She was getting jittery already . There used to be a number you could phone ... but anyway she would have to hurry . She took the cake off the sill , felt it to see if it was cool enough , and put it on the kitchen table . Then she began to operate . With the two forks she pulled it in half through the middle . One half she placed flat side down on the platter . She scooped out part of it and made a head with the section she had taken out . Then she nipped in a waist at the sides . The other half she pulled into strips for the arms and legs . The spongy cake was pliable , easy to mould . She stuck all the separate members together with white icing , and used the rest of the icing to cover the shape she had constructed . It was bumpy in places and had too many crumbs in the skin , but it would do . She reinforced the feet and ankles with tooth - picks . Now she had a blank white body . It looked slightly obscene , lying there soft and sugary and featureless on the platter . She set about clothing it , filling the cake - decorator with bright pink icing . First she gave it a bikini , but that was too sparse . She filled in the midriff . Now it had an ordinary bathing - suit , but that still was n't exactly what she wanted . She kept extending , adding to top and bottom , until she had a dress of sorts . In a burst of exuberance she added a row of ruffles around the neckline , and more ruffles at the hem of the dress . She made a smiling lush - lipped pink mouth and pink shoes to match . Finally she put five pink fingernails on each of the amorphous hands . The cake looked peculiar with only a mouth and no hair or eyes . She rinsed out the cake - decorator and filled it with chocolate icing . She drew a nose , and two large eyes , to which she appended many eyelashes and two eyebrows , one above each eye . For emphasis she made a line demarcating one leg from the other , and similar lines to separate the arms from the body . The hair took longer . It involved masses of intricate baroque scrolls and swirls , piled high on the head and spilling down over the shoulders . The eyes were still blank . She decided on green - the only other possibilities were red and yellow , since they were the only other colours she had - and with a toothpick applied two irises of green food - colouring . 269 Now there were only the globular silver decorations to add . One went in each eye , for a pupil . With the others she made a floral design on the pink dress , and stuck a few in the hair . Now the woman looked like an elegant antique china figurine . For an instant she wished she had bought some birthday candles ; but where could they be put ? There was really no room for them . The image was complete . Her creation gazed up at her , its face^QMikeand vacant except for the small silver glitter of intelligence in each green eye . While making it she had been almost gleeful , but now , contemplating it , she was pensive . All that work had gone into the lady and now what would happen to her ? "
122200	122205	122196	122196	You	2081	" she told her . "
122227	122428	122196	122196	You	2081	" At the thought of food her stomach contracted . She felt a certain pity for her creature but she was powerless now to do anything about it . Her fate had been decided . Already Peter 's footsteps were coming up the stairs . Marian had a swift vision of her own monumental silliness , of how infantile and undignified she would seem in the eyes of any rational observer . What kind of game did she think she was playing ? But that was n't the point , she told herself nervously , pushing back a strand of hair . Though if Peter found her silly she would believe it , she would accept his version of herself , he would laugh and they would sit down and have a quiet cup of tea . She smiled gravely at Peter as he came up out of the stairwell . The expression on his face , a scowl combined with a jutting chin , meant he was still angry . He was wearing a costume suitable for being angry in : the suit stern , tailored , remote , but the tie a paisley with touches of sullen maroon . "
122435	122439	122440	122440	Peter	53	" he began . "
122472	122801	122802	122802	You	2084	" She smiled at him again . He was puzzled , and forgot to sustain his frown ; he must have been expecting an awkward apology . But he did as she suggested . She remained in the doorway for a moment , looking almost tenderly 270 at the back of his head resting against the chesterfield . Now that she had seen him again , the actual Peter , solid as ever , the fears of the evening before had dwindled to foolish hysteria and the flight to Duncan had become a stupidity , an evasion ; she could hardly remember what he looked like . Peter was not the enemy after all , he was just a normal human being like most other people . She wanted to touch his neck , tell him that he should n't get upset , that everything was going to be all right . It was Duncan that was the mutation . But there was something about his shoulders . He must have been sitting with his arms folded . The face on the other side of that head could have belonged to anyone . And they all wore clothes of real cloth and had real bodies : those in the newspapers , those still unknown , waiting for their chance to aim from the upstairs window ; you passed them on the streets every day . It was easy to see him as normal and safe in the afternoon , but that did n't alter things . The price of this version of reality was testing the other one . She went into the kitchen and returned , bearing the platter in front of her , carefully and with reverence , as though she was carrying something sacred in a procession , an icon or the crown on a cushion in a play . She knelt , setting the platter on the coffee - table in front of Peter . "

123016	123024	123025	123025	she	2085	" I 'll start with the feet , "
123275	123278	123280	123280	Marian	112	" Hi , "
123329	123338	123339	123339	She	52	" Marian , what have you got there ? "
123345	123357	123358	123358	She	52	" It 's a woman - a woman made of cake ! "
123370	123374	123375	123375	she	112	" Have some , "
123378	123390	123375	123375	she	112	" it 's really good . I made it this afternoon . "

123517	123524	123525	123525	She	112	" It 's only a cake . "
123900	123903	123904	123904	he	54	" Well ? "
123907	123911	123904	123904	he	54	" What happened ? "
123912	123918	123919	123919	I	0	" It 's all off , "
123922	123941	123919	123919	I	0	" I realized Peter was trying to destroy me . So now I 'm looking for another job . "
123944	123947	123949	123949	Duncan	54	" Oh , "
123951	123966	123949	123949	Duncan	54	" Actually I did n't mean that . I was wondering more about Fischer/ ' "
123969	123978	123949	123949	Duncan	54	" I said . I might have known . "
124004	124005	124006	124006	His	54	" "
124014	124015	124009	124009	You	0	" "
124018	124022	124023	124023	I	0	" said Duncan . "
124034	124035	124036	124036	I	0	" "
124043	124089	124036	124036	I	0	" I said . I was irritated with him for not wanting to discuss what I was going to do myself . Now that I was thinking of myself in the first person singular again I found my own situation much more interesting than his . "
124094	124098	124036	124036	I	0	" Duncan said , "
124135	124147	124127	124127	You	0	" Face it , I thought , you ca n't win . "
124172	124292	124294	124294	I	0	" I added apologetically . When he arrived I was finishing the windows , standing on a chair and wiping off the white glass - cleaner I had spread on them . We had n't cleaned them for a long time and they had got quite silted over with dust , and I was thinking it was going to be curious to be able to see out of them again . It bothered me that there was still some dirt on the outside I could n't reach : soot and rainstreaks . I did n't hear Duncan come in . He had probably been standing in the room for several minutes watching me before he announced his presence by saying "
124297	124301	124294	124294	I	0	" I jumped . "
124305	124309	124294	124294	I	0	" I said , "
124324	124429	124310	124310	I	0	" He wandered off in the direction of the kitchen . After giving the window one last polish with a sleeve torn from one of Ainsley 's abandoned blouses I got down from the chair , somewhat reluctantly -1 like to finish things once I 've begun them and there were still several windows left uncleaned ; besides , the prospect of discussing the love life of Fischer Smythe was n't all that compelling - and went out to the kitchen . I found Duncan sitting in one of the chairs , regarding the open refrigerator door with a mixture of distaste and anxiety . "
124435	124444	124310	124310	I	0	" he asked , sniffing the air . 278 "
124450	124455	124310	124310	I	0	" I answered lightly . "
124466	124476	124310	124310	I	0	" I went over and opened the kitchen window . "
124481	124482	124310	124310	I	0	" "
124487	124491	124310	124310	I	0	" he said . "
124500	124501	124502	124502	You	0	" "
124509	124535	124502	124502	You	0	" Tea would be easier , but a quick root through the cupboards did n't uncover any . I measured the coffee into the percolator . "
124557	124558	124543	124543	Fish	92	" "
124572	124601	124566	124566	They	2102	" I said . I turned on the coffee and sat down . I had thoughts of holding out on him but he was beginning to look hurt . "
124618	124703	124611	124611	I	0	" Ainsley had come in the day before after another prolonged absence and had packed her suitcases while Fischer waited in the living room , head thrown back against the cushions of the chesterfield , beard bristling with the consciousness of its own vitality , eyes closed . She had given me to understand in the few sentences she had time for that they were going to Niagara Falls for their honeymoon and that she thought Fischer would make , as she put it , "
124708	124740	124611	124611	I	0	" . I explained all this to Duncan as well as I could . He did not seem either dismayed or delighted , or even surprised , by any of it . "
124743	124747	124611	124611	I	0	" he said , "
124826	124827	124828	124828	I	0	" "
124838	124875	124836	124836	Ainsley	52	" I really did hope so . I was pleased with her for justifying my superstitious belief in her ability to take care of herself : for a while there I had begun to lose faith . "
124879	124883	124888	124888	she	52	" I said , "
124900	124901	124888	124888	she	52	" "
124909	124921	124888	124888	she	52	" Duncan said reflectively . He was gnawing on his thumb . "
124930	124988	124989	124989	I	0	" He did not seem overly interested in the question . Talking about Ainsley made me think of Leonard . I had called * 79 Clara shortly after I had heard the news about Ainsley 's marriage , so she could tell Len it was safe to come out of hiding . Later she had called back . "
124994	124998	124999	124999	he	2108	" she said , "
125148	125181	125142	125142	I	0	" Nevertheless she had sounded more competent than usual . There was a loud metallic clunk from inside the refrigerator . Duncan jerked , and took his thumb out of his mouth . "
125186	125187	125142	125142	I	0	" "
125197	125201	125202	125202	I	0	" I said . "
125208	125224	125202	125202	I	0	" The coffee smelled done . I set two cups on the table and poured . "
125232	125241	125228	125228	you	0	" Duncan asked after a moment of silence . "
125250	125254	125228	125228	you	0	" I said . "
125261	125288	125255	125255	I	0	" This last remark had been motivated by pride . It still was miraculous to me that I had attempted anything so daring and had succeeded . "
125297	125316	125317	125317	You	0	" Duncan said . He looked at me directly for the first time since he had come in . "
125337	125338	125333	125333	you	0	" "
125343	125347	125339	125339	I	0	" I said . "

125365	125369	125359	125359	Peter	53	" I nodded . "
125374	125379	125359	125359	Peter	53	" he said gravely . "
125409	125414	125415	125415	I	0	" Is that true ? "
125418	125423	125424	125424	he	53	" Search your soul , "
125451	125476	125436	125436	He	53	" But the real truth is that it was n't Peter at all . It was me . I was trying to destroy you . "
125483	125489	125477	125477	I	0	" Do n't say that . "
125490	125493	125494	125494	he	53	" Okay , "
125497	125548	125494	125494	he	53	" ever eager to please . Maybe Peter was trying to destroy me , or maybe I was trying to destroy him , or we were both trying to destroy each other , how 's that ? What does it matter , you 're bacJ^to^-caUed_reality , you 're a consumer/ ' "
125551	125557	125494	125494	he	53	" I said , remembering , "
125564	125607	125494	125494	he	53	" I had half the torso and the head left over . He nodded . I got him a fork and took the remains of the cadaver down from the shelf where I had put it . I unwrapped its cellophane shroud . "
125614	125618	125494	125494	he	53	" I said . "
125628	125636	125623	125623	you	0	" he said after the first forkful . "
125646	125647	125623	125623	you	0	" "
125651	125656	125649	125649	you	53	" I said modestly . "
125667	125795	125797	125797	you	0	" I sat watching the cake disappear , the smiling pink mouth first , then the nose and then one eye . For a moment there was nothing left of the face but the last green eye ; then it too vanished , like a wink . He started devouring the hair . It gave me a peculiar sense of satisfaction to see him eat as if the work had n't been wasted after all - although the cake was absorbed without exclamations of pleasure , even without noticeable expression . I smiled comfortably at him . He did not smile back ; he was concentrating on the business at hand . He scraped the last chocolate curl up with his fork and pushed away the plate . "
125799	125807	125797	125797	you	0	" he said , licking his lips . "
