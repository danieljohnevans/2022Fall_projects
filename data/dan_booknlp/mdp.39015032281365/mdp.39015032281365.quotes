Who has survived ? A handful of high officials had access to shelters established against enemy attack . Some of them thought to bring women with them . Women had not been part of the desperate government of the times ; they had resigned or had been pushed out as idealists or hysterics . As the world outside withered and blackened , the men thought they saw reproach in the whitened faces of the women they had saved and thought they heard accusation in the women 's voices . Many of these women had lost children in the holocaust . The men did not notice their own shocked faces and raw voices . They had acted , they thought , responsibly , rightly - and had lost everything . They did not realize they had lost their sanity , too . They forbade all women to attend meetings and told them to keep their eyes lowered and their mouths shut and to mind their own business , which was reproduction . Among themselves , most of the women thought as women were taught to think : it would be proper and a relief to think of nothing but babies any more , and while the men were crazy with grief , guilt and helplessness it was support they needed , not antagonism . These women said to one another , let 's do what they say for now . 4 Walk to the End of the World A few objected , saying , no , these men will enslave us if we let them ; no one is left to be their slaves except us ! They tried to convince the others . The men heard , and they rejoiced to find an enemy they could conquer at last . One night , as planned , they pulled all the women from sleep , herded them together , and harangued them , saying , remember that you caused the Wasting . It was a Black female 's refusal to sit in the back of the bus that sparked the rebellion of the Blacks ; female Gooks fought against our troops in the Eastern Wars ; female terrorists made bombs side by side with our own rebel sons , whose mothers had brought them up to be half - men ; female vermin of all kinds spewed out millions of young to steal our foodsupplies and our living space ! Females themselves brought on the Wasting of the world ! And the men , armed with staves and straps , reminded them and saw to it that these things were not forgotten again . It is their male descendants who emerge from the Refuge to find the world scoured of animal life and beggared of resources . They continue the heroic , pioneering tradition of their kind : they kill the few wretched mutants who have persisted outside and clear the spiky brush from a strip of river - valley and seacoast where they establish a new civilization . They call their land the Holdfast , after the anchoring tendril by which seaweed clings to the rocks against the pull of the current . Seaweed is an important source of nourishment to these new men ; so is the hardy hemp plant , a noxious weed to the Ancients but now a staple crop that furnishes fiber , a vision - giving drug , and , because the new men are of necessity ingenious , food . Bricks are made from earth ; machine graveyards are mined for metal ; a vein of soft and greasy coal yields fuel ; wood is brought from the low and thorny forests of the Wild beyond the Holdfast 's borders . Nothing is abundant , but men live . They have not completely forgotten technology or culture , and they adapt what they can . What else do they remember ? They remember the evil races whose red skins , brown skins , yellow skins , black skins , skins all the colors of fresh - turned earth marked them as mere treacherous imitations of men , who are white ; youths who repudiated their fathers '

2333	2377	2321	2323	Rover Captain Kelmz	166	' D Layo got up , making ineffectual brushing - off motions with both hands . There was some blood ; in the feeble lamplight , the captain could see the dark line weaving down around the socket of d Layo 's eye . '

Between their resentment and the suspicion of the Seniors , a moonlit night was hardly the time for prudent men to venture into the sheds of Lammintown beach . Captain Kelmz 13 To keep the heat under the vats high without tending all night the wall - mats of the shed had been rolled down and secured . The waiting men were confined with the bitter stink of boiling lammin and the roaring of the furnaces under the two working vats . A. brace of Rovers , under Kelmz '
3065	3198	3060	3060	they	172	' voice and hands . The Senior himself looked no different here than he looked when at ease in his home - compound in the City . He stood with his stumpy legs planted apart , his hands folded neatly on his belly . Despite the heat , he had n't even bothered to draw the starched folds of his mantle down from around his neck and shoulders . His round , balding head was tilted back . High above them , a network of taut , heavy ropes webbed the mouths of the vats . Two young men ran barefoot over the lines , flickering like visions . Now and then one of them would pause for an instant to cast a wide and measuring glance over the heaving surface of the '
3200	3264	3266	3266	your	535	' they tended . The metal hooks they carried swung gleaming from each hand . Their skins were sweat - bright and smudged with smoke . They shaved themselves hairless to keep the soup clean , and they wore only shorts . The hooks , part of their balance , hung as naturally from their hands as fingers from the captain 's own . '
3273	3358	3368	3368	his	536	' warned the workchants of the sheds . It was unarguably the dirtiest work men had to do in the Holdfast . Periodically , proposals were made to turn it over to fems instead , but this phase of the processing of a staple of men 's diet was considered too important to be entrusted to fems . Besides , attachment to the sheds for a time was a handy punishment for insolent young men . Only one of the pair now running wore the '
3497	3499	3533	3534	the Senior	5162	' Wares '
3528	3531	3533	3534	the Senior	5162	' Servan , '
3549	3555	3537	3537	his	5162	' where can we talk ? '
3556	3562	3563	3564	the DarkDreamer	439	' Right here , Senior , '
3567	3592	3593	3593	He	5162	' It 's safe . The patrols keep the beach clear at night now , and the lads up there ca n't hear us . '
3626	3636	3637	3638	d Layo	218	' Now , Senior — Bajerman , is it ? '
3650	3711	3712	3712	He	218	' It 's been some time since our last meeting . Oh , please , let 's have no apologies over all that , the past is the past . In the interests of brotherly harmony , let 's comport ourselves like men newly met . You do n't mind the suggestion coming from a younger man , I hope . '
3729	3762	3723	3724	d Layo	218	' Now , what can this humble young man do for so great a Senior ? Nothing too strenuous , I hope ? Your messenger found me at an awkward time ; I 'm
3770	3771	3723	3724	d Layo	218	' '
3785	3791	3779	3779	I	0	' the Senior said calmly . '
3798	3803	3793	3794	the outlaw	549	' The Senior said , '
3808	3809	3806	3806	yourself	5162	' '
3819	3824	3817	3817	Senior	550	' d Layo smiled . '
3846	3847	3832	3832	Seniors	172	' '
3866	3867	3868	3868	I	0	' '
3871	3877	3868	3868	I	0	' d Layo said piously , '
3891	4277	4287	4287	You	551	' Knowing things that were not his business had never brought the captain anything but trouble . He withdrew into his own thoughts , yet kept alert . An officer 's eyes were trained to be ceaselessly on the move . His success depended on his ability to notice and counteract any inadvertant cues that might set his Rovers off , especially in unfamiliar surroundings . Captain Kelmz 15 D Layo and the Senior could arouse the Rovers themselves with harsh tones or sharp gestures ; but they were n't arguing . Far from it . TheDarkDreamer teased and mocked with both voice and gestures . The Senior sat back stiffly , resisting ; again and again he spoke with the insistence of a man trying to restate the serious core of a wandering discussion . Both men knew this game well and played it with pleasure . They ignored even the rumbling of a ladle rolling in its socket overhead , intent as they were on the levels of their game . The captain 's own game began in his head ; he saw the Senior as a large , horn - headed beast . The red - and - black mantle became the burnished hide of a thick - shouldered creature , slow but strong , confident and patient , ready to outlast the subtle prowler opposite him , the tawny hunter d Layo . Come to my teeth and my claws , coaxed d Layo ; come to my horns and my hooves , lowed the other . They smiled and played their strategies of menace and attraction . Kelmz shook his head ; but he could no more shake free of these visions than he could shake the roar of the fires out of his ears while he stood within reach of their heat . He hugged his ribs with his elbows , blotting the tickling runnels of sweat on his skin . He was bruised from his struggle with the DarkDreamer . Kelmz was too old for such tussles . It looked as if Senior Bajerman had gotten what he wanted now . He was winding up the conversation , expounding on the need for the raw strength of young men to be curbed by the wisdom of their elders . '
4281	4286	4287	4287	You	551	' murmured d Layo . '
4323	4331	4312	4317	A man with experience running Rovers	553	' His dark eyes mocked the captain . '
4334	4369	4312	4317	A man with experience running Rovers	553	' Kelmz blurted , but he had to pause to calm the Rovers , who reacted to his own agitation . This pause gave him time to steady himself as well . He said , '
4386	4387	4391	4391	you	0	' '
4393	4414	4391	4391	you	0	' the DarkDreamer said . He rose and arched his back , as if bored with a matter already settled . '
4421	4476	4419	4419	Captain	555	' the Senior said . Kelmz bent his head in submission and to hide his angry face . It was clear from the Senior 's smug look that he had expected d Layo 's request . 16 Walk to the End of the World The Senior said he would take over direct control of Kelmz '
4494	4515	4530	4531	the Senior	5162	' It should be welcome to you , Captain , to be relieved of your ordinary responsibilities for a time . '
4593	4596	4598	4599	the Senior	5162	' Hero ! '
4604	4612	4598	4599	the Senior	5162	' I need your escort through danger ! '
4703	4830	4701	4702	the Rovers	169	' minds made them not only alert and fierce , but indiscriminately dangerous unless skillfully handled . Each Rover , in his isolated vision of himself as a hero constantly on guard , imagined all orders to be for his ears alone and himself to be the sole subject of all events . Roveregotism was considered a sign of healthy , manly individualism and was encouraged , so that getting even two to work efficiently together as a brace was difficult . Kelmz momentarily wished that the Senior would n't be able to hold them ; but whatever happened to Senior Bajerman in that case , the Rovers would have to be destroyed as rogues , so it was hardly a thought worthy of an officer . '
4834	4882	4701	4702	the Rovers	169	' said the Senior . He drew aside his mantle for a parting salute . The skin of his shoulder was elaborately patterned with the dark dyes of high rank . Kelmz and the Rovers all touched their own shoulders and bowed . But the DarkDreamer smiled . '
4889	4896	4884	4884	you	565	' the Senior said , sharply . '
4935	4936	4969	4970	Senior Bajerman	174	' '

4982	4998	4977	4980	a memorable young man	570	' He turned and left them , the Rovers pacing alertly at his back . 2 '
5010	5015	4999	4999	We	571	' d Layo said . '
5037	5040	5041	5041	Kelmz	166	're off . '
5045	5055	5041	5041	Kelmz	166	' Do n't you want to ask me where we 're
5070	5071	5061	5061	you	166	' '
5078	5082	5083	5083	I	0	' Kelmz said . '
5084	5090	5061	5061	you	166	'm talking to you now . '
5535	5538	5540	5540	Layo	166	' Scared ? '
6099	6181	6094	6094	He	166	' Have your Seniors been trying to get rid of you for long ? Well , it 's obvious that they must want to . A man like you with gray hair and nothing but Junior - stripes on your shoulder must make them nervous , wondering why you persist in standing out of order , so to speak . Maybe they feel insulted that you hang back as if the company of your peers is n't good enough for you . '
6182	6188	6189	6189	Kelmz	166	' I like my work , '
6192	6199	6189	6189	Kelmz	166	' Too much for your own Seniors '
6265	6277	6261	6261	I	0	' Captain Kelmz 21 Muffled thumping sounds and the drone of fems '
6325	6337	6339	6339	Layo	166	' Does Bajerman want to unload you because he 's jealous ? '
6343	6358	6339	6339	Layo	166	' Does our esteemed Senior have his eye on some young Rover of yours ? '
6359	6365	6406	6406	his	166	' Rovers make poor lovers . '
6366	6382	6406	6406	his	166	' Or have you an admirer outside Rover - ranks whom Bajerman wants for himself ? '
6383	6392	6339	6339	Layo	166	' I have n't the looks for it . '
6393	6400	6406	6406	his	166	' But the lads love scars , '
6431	6453	6454	6454	He	166	' Now what 's this ? I keep some things of mine in the back here , things we 'll need . '
6496	6520	6521	6521	Somebody	649	' Wares in charge of the shredding - gang . He peered out of the yellow light and said irritably to d Layo , '
6529	6530	6521	6521	Somebody	649	' '
6536	6538	6541	6541	his	648	' The '
6544	6625	6541	6541	his	648	' One of the pilgrims that got turned back from Endpath today , and by the stink of him they should have let him in . He 's been sitting in the storage room all afternoon . I hope he has n't contaminated the place with some famishing disease . See you get him out by morning , and if any of your stuff 's missing , do n't blame me ; he 's the only one been back there . '
6630	6635	6641	6643	the ' Ware	5234	' Thanks , Jew . '
6636	6640	6541	6541	his	648	' Thanks yourself , '
6642	6657	6641	6643	the ' Ware	5234	' Ware muttered . He turned and shouted down the length of the shed , '
6681	6808	6809	6809	Christ	181	' He cracked his switch down on the table - end . The fems , working in teams across the narrow surface , pressed their lean bellies against the table 's edge . They did n't miss a note of their song . The twohandled shredding - blades jumped without pause between them , chopping and feeding the lammin - fragments steadily back into collecting sacks at the far end . 22 Walk to the End of the World The storage room smelled strongly of the pickling - tubs along one wall . A pyramid of lammin - packets occupied the center of the floor . Beside the mound a lamp burned , and a man sat straight - backed at the edge of the glow . '
6815	6820	6809	6809	Christ	181	' cursed d Layo . '
6833	6836	6832	6834	the ' Wares	5248	' Wares . '
6925	6935	6937	6937	Layo	166	' How did you know where to find me ? '
6940	6947	6948	6949	The stranger	655	' Who is this with you ? '
6960	6966	6968	6968	Layo	166	' A man of mine , '
6980	6987	6988	6989	The stranger	655	' Captain Kelmz of the Hemaways . '
6995	7005	6988	6989	The stranger	655	' So the Hemaways have mixed into this already . '
7006	7050	7057	7058	the stranger	655	' It was Bajerman who came to see me , remember him ? He used to teach Deportment when we were in the Boyhouse . Now he claims to speak for the entire Board of Seniors . Thus is virtue rewarded with advancement . '
7136	7145	7146	7147	the Endtendant	664	' You 've made a deal with Bajerman , '
7150	7158	7146	7147	the Endtendant	664	' We dealt together , yes . I 'm
7189	7202	7146	7147	the Endtendant	664	' The Endtendant made an abrupt , impatient movement of his head . '
7209	7214	7146	7147	the Endtendant	664	' d Layo added , '
7221	7291	7292	7292	Jew	180	' He settled himself cross - legged on the floor and with an expansive gesture invited Kelmz to sit , too . These were the kind of smart lads Kelmz had never felt comfortCaptain Kelmz 23 able with . Besides , they had been boys together , which shut Kelmz out . He remained standing . D Layo shrugged and turned again to the other , studying him crirically . '
7296	7302	7292	7292	Jew	180	' he said , grimacing . '
7308	7316	7307	7307	You	665	're not really sick , are you ? '
7317	7323	7324	7325	the Endtendant	182	' It 's the robe , '
7328	7351	7324	7325	the Endtendant	182	' I took it from one in the last group of pilgrims to be admitted . The smell of illness discourages curiosity . '
7352	7356	7324	7325	the Endtendant	182	' Who knows you 're
7359	7360	7361	7362	No one	5106	' '
7391	7396	7397	7397	They	673	' D Layo grinned . '
7459	7473	7423	7423	They	673	' Now tell me how it 's all more complicated than I think . '
7474	7499	7500	7501	D Layo	218	' Simpler . Mishandling of our cases has cost the Hemaways a great deal in standing . They want us both dead , Servan . '
7507	7528	7500	7501	D Layo	218	' I know they do n't like me , but they seem to have found a use for me anyway . '
7529	7540	7423	7423	They	673	' Yes , to deliver us both into their hands . '
7541	7561	7563	7563	Layo	218	' Oh , I can get what I want from them and leave them stumbling over their own feet , '
7568	7587	7588	7588	He	218	' I 've made a bargain , Eykar . Can you stop me from going through with it ? '
7595	7606	7588	7588	He	218	' We must consider my manly honor , after all . '
7685	7694	7696	7696	Layo	218	' Come on , Eykar , bribe me , '
7699	7720	7696	7696	Layo	218	' There must be something you can offer that would make it worth my while to hide you from them . '

7734	7751	7730	7731	the Endtendant	182	' I only want to stay out of their hands long enough to find my father . '
7970	7987	7966	7967	D Layo	218	' You got tired of waiting for the old man to come to you at Endpath ? '
8001	8017	7997	7998	the Endtendant	182	' I caught myself mixing an extra cup , the last time . For myself . '

8033	8043	8045	8045	Layo	218	' I do n't understand why he has n't , '
8048	8071	8045	8045	Layo	218	' Knowing your name and where to find you , why has n't he had you killed to safeguard his own life ? '

Though young , his face was clearly marked by inward struggle , bleached by the effort of disciCaptain Kelmz 25 pline even to the icy irises of the eyes . The pallor of the skin was spectral , set off by the brows and closehugging cap of black hair . Sharp - boned , etched in black and white , it was a fanatic 's face , as befitted one bent on smashing the law . D Layo 's voice was tender . '

Either way , d Layo was wolf enough to take Kelmz on here and now , and never mind official standings or the Streets of Honor . The Endtendant was looking at Kelmz with a steady , cool regard , though it was to d Layo that he spoke : '

To do that , you must fight Servan here at the outset . In spite of your reputation , I think Servan would kill you . I suggest that you turn your back on those who have turned their backs on you . Come with us . There 's no shame in a fighting death , but I would rather have you as an ally than leave you as a corpse on this fem - stinking beach . '

9692	9883	9666	9666	he	179	' The beach was empty ; even the shredding - shed was silent now . The Lammintown horns shouted periodically over the hissing of the sea . They walked by the water . The Endtendant held the skirts of the pilgrim robe clear of the wet sand by bunching his fists in the pockets . He looked eastward over the water , as if there were something to see out there . With the moon up so bright there were n't even any netting - crews out sifting the tides ; the plankton that they sought only surfaced on dark nights or if it were roiled up from the bottom by storms . It was too early in the fall for bad weather . Kelmz wondered where he would be when the storms began . He could n't see his way at all as a companion of these two . He did n't think he would ever be comfortable in the Endtendant 's company . They walked without speaking for some time until , brushing up against the Endtendant 's arm by accident , Kelmz felt a tremor in him . '

At the far end , where the ferry pylon reared up against the sky , the winch - housing of the coastal ferry was visible . One wincharm angled darkly up across the dawn . Some one was standing there , urgently waving : d Layo . They glanced at each other and stepped up their pace , walking swiftly past the shed . As they cleared it , a man straightened from examining footprints in the sand . He was a highmantled Senior . At his shout , two other men came charging around the side of the shed : 30 Walk to the End of the World Rovers . On the run , the captain veered toward the water , shouldering the Endtendant into it . They plunged through the icy tide and clambered into the first of the netting - boats . There was rope coiled in the prow , with a grapnel fixed to one end . Kelmz swung the grapnel and hurled it upward . The cross - arm caught behind the head of a piling above them . The Endtendant climbed up , the sea - soaked skirts of the robe clinging to his legs . Kelmz followed . As he had intended , the Rovers had been thrown off by the change of footing . They were pelting around the long way , up the steps into the pier from the landward end . Kelmz held back a pace , racing down the pier , to cover the Endtendant if he had to , for the Rovers were closing hard . A yard ahead of them , Kelmz and the Endtendant dashed across the gangway onto the deck of the ferry . Someone kicked away the gangway , and gouts of cold water shot up over the rail . The two Rovers stood panting on the pier , eyeing their trapped quarry . Kelmz '

11075	11090	11067	11067	Hak	188	' My gangway got knocked overside , Senior . There it is , floating . '
11129	11155	11124	11124	he	5162	' This is n't the first time we 've had trouble with you Chesters this five - year . Your superiors will not be pleased . '

11209	11217	11204	11205	The Senior	5162	' This is no game , Boyo . '
11241	11381	11239	11242	The other ' Ware	5359	' Ware , a Junior , hung unhappily in the background , pretending to be blind and deaf for fear he would have to pay later for having witnessed the scoring - off of the Senior at a Junior 's hands . In theory , the Senior should not have entered into any gamepoint rivalry with the young man , since for anyone over the age of thirty the simple accretion of years measured personal worth on an absolute scale . But informally , fierce competition was the rule among Seniors as well as Juniors , though normally it was confined to verbal games like this one . Older men found in the accumulation of gamepoints ( which they affected to despise ) a way of unofficially offsetting the implacable order of the age - scale among themselves . This '

11515	11561	11596	11597	The Senior	5162	' The ferryman took off his grimy cap and scratched his head . He squinted down the coast toward the next pylon , and the ones beyond that ; they marched parallel to the beach in single file as far as the eye could see . '
11572	11577	11596	11597	The Senior	5162	' he demanded suddenly . '
11589	11595	11596	11597	The Senior	5162	' Wares that say it ? '
11603	11615	11596	11597	The Senior	5162	' I did n't criticize the way you do your job - '
11616	11653	11659	11660	the Senior	5162	' Then what 's this talk about getting me off my boat ? You trying to score me off , Senior ? Taking advantage of a rough working lad that 's been at sea too long ? '
11737	11813	11726	11727	The Senior	5162	' A man who helps a thief is worse than a thief , in these lean times . You might remember that you are no Pennelton , to walk off this boat in Bayo and sleep safe for the rest of the five - year with the whole coast between us . You 'll be coming back here on your return run , and when you do , I 'll have your standing stripped . You 're
11853	11876	11851	11851	you	791	' Think about that , Junior , and consider : who should pay the price of theft , you or the thieves ? '

11918	11937	11909	11910	Captain Kelmz	179	' Without another word , the Senior turned and stalked off , with his entourage hurrying after him . ‘
11945	11997	11998	11998	he	192	' Hak muttered . Giving Kelmz a sour grin , he stumped off toward the winch deck , shouting at the men standing there . They leaped up onto the winch housing and laid hold of the handles with their gauntleted hands . D Layo sighed . “ Well , Captain , '
12001	12013	11998	11998	he	192	' I suppose I must grant you some usefulness after all . '
12305	12835	12282	12283	the Board	667	' Troi could only turn out so much metal goods per five - year . Tools , weapons , and Captain Kelmz 35 replacement parts for the few machines still in use had priority . Extra work - time and material tended to go into luxury items like jewelry , which only Seniors could afford . The ferries were powered by machines . Troi engineers had designed a system of gears by means of which the strength of men on the winch was amplified and transferred to rotary blades at the rear of the craft . Certainty of staying within sight of land was assured by the long cable which fed down from the pylons through a wheel fixed to the midships decking . The whole arrangement was slow and clumsy , but free of the perils of fast - moving , free - ranging boats . The Holdfast could not afford to lose another ferry . All that remained of shipyard skill was the ability to patch and trim existing vessels with wood won from the Wild . Each bit of the precious material was polished and shaped by the hand of every man in a given crew before being ceremonially installed . The names of the men who dared the empty lands beyond the borders of the Holdfast to obtain wood went into special Chants Celebratory concerning the ferries . Every step of the patching process was , like most of the things the ferrymen did , part of a fabric of custom intended to hold ferrycrews together in manly order , despite their isolation between empty sea and empty sky . The huge hold of the coastal ferry was lit by hanging lamps and stray sunlight that entered the high - set ports . The air was hot , moist and permanently impregnated with the reek of sweat , lammins and beer . The noise never stopped . At the center of the hold was the play - pen , a pit of sand that was the scene of the perpetual contests and games with which ferrymen filled their off - deck hours . Something was always going on in the pen and at the tile gameboards that made up the apron around it . Every match drew its mob of shouting spectators . Forward , the sweating sloppers tended cook - tubs sunk into the tops of great clay fire - boxes in which fires roared day and night . Aft , past the cargo - space and the rows of crewmen 's hammocks , someone was always playing the part of story - box to whatever audience he could keep , bellowing out his tale in order to be heard above the general din . The entire ship reverberated ceaselessly to the growling of winch and propeller blades . The gleaming skins of the ferrymen , who went about in shorts or nothing at all below decks , reminded Kelmz of insect armor . Even 36 Walk to the End of the World the interminable activity and racket struck him as mimicry of the meaningless scurryings of those strange , tiny beasts of the Ancients '
12954	13251	13254	13255	the DarkDreamer	439	' tables — was invariably blue - stew with dollops of the hemproot starch called taydo in it ; thin slice 's of hempseed bread smeared with plankton jelly ; and pale beer to wash it all down . The only relief was the occasional fresh salad made with the lammins that d Layo had turned over to the sloppers on first entering the hold . That gesture had won him friends from the start . He had built on this beginning by becoming an enthusiastic participant in the games at the play - pen . As a DarkDreamer and an outlaw he lived outside the company system of work- and gamepoints , so he took his winnings in cash . This should have made trouble for him since Juniors were always short of cash , their only means of buying any sort of luxury beyond the subsistence distributed to them by the companies . Yet without apparent effort , d Layo shortly became so popular with the young Chesters that he influenced their private status structure . Officially , work - points determined a company 's subsistence portion every five - year , and game - points converted into individual shares of spending cash for the Juniors . But among themselves young men vied for standing on the basis of scars . This system had begun as a defiant glorification of the marks of corporal punishment . By the time the Board had substituted more subtle forms of discipline , the Holdfast Juniors had established an underground hierarchy based not only on verbal contests but on scars gotten in fights . It was rare for a young man not to be marked up , even if he had to inflict wounds on himself . To Kelmz '
13418	13662	13410	13411	D Layo	218	' influence , not his own . By professional habit the captain sported no ornaments . He continued to wear his patched and threadbare suit of blanks , saving his uniform . It was not a Rover 's way to display his body like a boastful boy . Kelmz was hoping the anonymity of blanks would help him spend the voyage in quiet obscurity . However , on the first morning out he woke from a fretful doze to find a ribby , freckle - skinned lad , ostentatiously scarred on chest and arms , waiting silently by his hammock . This Junior politely requested that Captain Kelmz come join a group at the story - box . Once Kelmz accepted out of courtesy , he found himself trapped into a pattern that repeated itself daily , to his intense embarrassment . The young men would begin complimenting him . By reputation , it seemed , Kelmz was strong , skillful , efficient , loyal , brave , honest , and on and on until he could n't tell whether they were describing some mythical paragon of the manly virtues or trying to make a fool of him . He would sit among them with a flush in his seamed cheeks and his big hands clenched , until he could bear no more of their bright - faced praise . When he finally started to rise and leave them , someone would say , '
13685	13733	13671	13671	Rovers	169	' Or about the skirmish with Birj Company at the City breweries , or a fight in a Lammintown Street of Honor , or even the time he had carried his friend Danzer , fatally injured , five miles on his own back ? These lads knew Kelmz '
13794	13843	13844	13844	Kelmz	166	' stories were always interrupted . D Layo claimed that some of the regular Chester story - boxers were angry because Kelmz was stealing their audience . Kelmz said he did n't understand how the young men knew so much about him . The DarkDreamer laughed at that . '
13867	13884	13866	13866	you	166	're a walking legend , and for once there are no Seniors around to check the lads '
13921	13922	13923	13923	They	841	' '
13931	13952	13923	13923	They	841	' Kelmz muttered and refused to discuss the matter further . He felt as if he had won the young Chesters '
14503	14579	14487	14487	he	188	' reputation and because of a natural sympathy for any young men in trouble with Seniors . He had not counted on one of the fugitives turning out to be an outlaw Endtendant . D Layo got to his feet , brushing sand from his chest and arms . Though his skin was blotched with red marks from a play - pen match , he seemed unruffled and spoke in a tone of light incredulity . '
14619	14652	14487	14487	he	188	' The listeners guffawed ; young men sometimes called Seniors that , meaning that the only thing an old man could still get up was his mantle . Sullen - face retorted , '
14685	14715	14716	14716	Hak	188	' 40 Walk to the End of the World At that point someone noticed the two new arrivals , and a cry was raised : There 's the man ! '

14735	14738	14731	14732	the Endtendant	182	' Yes . '

14786	14854	14783	14783	Hak	188	' I know who gets - blamed by those here when this five - year ends and the work - points and game - points presented by this company are discounted by the Board because we 've helped a renegade Endtendant . There wo n't be plenty to go around to begin with . The Board will be looking for reasons to cut shares where they can . '

14945	14998	14942	14942	he	218	' a certain boy was put into my class . Everyone talked about him , not because he was smart and was being moved ahead of his age - peers , but because he was special in another way : he knew his father 's name , and his father knew his . '
15131	15402	15427	15428	the father	903	' involuntary , irrational aggression by striking first . On the other hand , the Holdfast needed these sons to live long enough to outgrow the fem - taint and join the world of mature men in their turn . This was the reason for the existence of the Boyhouse and the justification for the strict lives led by its inmates . The rules were harsh , designed not only to wipe out the unmanly streak as / 42 Walk to the End of the World soon as possible , but to protect boys from the righteous wrath of their fathers in the meantime . There had been times when adult men had organized deadly raids on whatever concentrations of boys they could find . This sport had served as a reminder that men would not forget the Freaks , the sons of Ancient men who had turned against their fathers in the Wasting and paid for their treachery with their lives . The raids no longer occurred . The Boyhouse kept the boys , and with them the future , safe ; here their souls were beaten into a hardness that would be fitting to the souls of men . Later , men grew old enough to breed and to search the faces of young boys for likenesses to their own . But no one ever forgot his own time within the Boyhouse walls , hiding in the anonymous mob of his peers . The young Chesters squirmed in their places , thinking of the boy who had known his father 's name and whose father had known his . '

15559	15601	15640	15640	He	218	' Next , he arranged to be in the City when that fem was sent to the Hospital to drop her young . Now , what do you think would have happened if the bitch had dropped a fem - cub ? '

15624	15635	15640	15640	He	218	' Since you ask me , I 'll tell you , '
15670	15778	15640	15640	He	218	' Maggomas had a confederate at the Hospital , and that man marked the cub with the same blue mark that was on the neck of the fem that had dropped it . So when Maggomas sneaked into the Boyhouse next day , he found the marked cub and read off the name the Captain Kelmz 43 Teachers had inscribed on its boy - tags . But having accomplices means sharing secrets , and you all know how the cloth - cocks talk , sitting with their lumpy old feet up to the hearth - fire day and night . Some years later , word got out . '

When the rumors reached him , he heard the name of his father for the first time . Think about living with that : listening for the footfalls of a murderer at night , studying the faces of the Teachers for one who had been paid to strike for Maggomas . . . '

Ask him where he 's going and who he 's looking 44 Walk to the End of the World for and what he means to do when he finds him ! '

16386	16432	16377	16378	the Endtendant	182	' is this : I want to know why I was singled out from among those who otherwise would have been my peers . I want to know the reason for blackening my whole life with the shadow of another man , of another generation . '
16440	16455	16433	16434	A Junior	5360	' I have a question I 'd like asked too , as long as you 're
16517	16738	16511	16511	I	0	' He sat down again . Other questions followed . The Chester Juniors asked what they would never have dared to ask any Senior to his face : how was it that the cloth - cocks took the most powerful manna to dream themselves into fitting strength of mind and virtue , but still acted with spite and self - indulgence when awake ? How was it that they said one thing and did another , all the time cursing the Juniors for famishing deceitfulness ? Enforced the age - line except where it cut them off from the objects of their own lusts ? Would hear no petition from younger men unless in the presence of the Boardmen , whose power over young men 's lives was utterly intimidating ? Ruled that a young man had to carry all his life a name picked from a list drawn out of the Boardmen 's dreams , though he might wish to call himself after some friend or hero in respectful memory ? Their voices raw with fury , the Chesters gave the Endtendant no chance to speak . He stood silent , ice - eyed , like a personification of the cold heart of their rage . When the excitement began to die down , Hak made one last try : '
16752	16753	16744	16745	this DarkDreamer	943	' '
16759	16769	16744	16745	this DarkDreamer	943	' d Layo rejoined . He nodded at Kelmz . '
16795	16857	16782	16789	the man who wo n't take his mantle	718	' KeVmz . cleared his throat and said he thought truth had been spoken . The Chesters set up a roar and a storm of clapping . Hak bowed to it ; he promised on behalf of the whole company to do what was needed to speed the Endtendant on his way . Immediately , d Layo outlined what he wanted . '
16974	17013	16960	16960	lads	956	' Set us down on the coast a little way north , and you go on upriver and dock at Bayo as usual . We 'll make our way there through the marshes and try to enter the fems '
17043	17051	16960	16960	lads	956	're looking for a way into the fems '
17054	17059	17061	17061	our	948	' After that , we 're

17088	17101	17067	17067	you	954	' said Hak , promptly , before any more could be asked . '
17104	17113	17067	17067	you	954	' shouted the Chester Juniors . Someone added , '
17121	17184	17067	17067	you	954	' a cry which others took up . Ferrymen were only permitted to dream between runs , under the auspices of their Seniors . Now they were daring in their excitement . Learning that d Layo had only enough manna to serve a few , they quickly put together a group of eight to represent the complicity of them all in the fugitives '
17607	17716	17753	17754	Captain Kelmz	166	' mind . He glanced at the Endtendant , whose angular face showed nothing at all . It was absurd to impute nostalgia to him , of course . The dream he had given had always been death . He could hardly have put off his own bracelet of office with any feeling but relief . D Layo began handing out the cups . Bek refused with a wordless shake of his head , and no one made anything of it ; but when Kelmz hesitated , he noticed that several of the ferrymen were watching him anxiously . Perhaps they had never DarkDreamed before . They trusted Kelmz '
18067	18072	18063	18063	me	0	' d Layo murmured , '
18112	18519	18098	18099	a DarkDreamer	5428	' The insidious lure of DarkDreaming lay partly in this deliberate abolition of hierarchy . D Layo led them into the void of their hidden selves , where any mad chaos was possible . He was skillful , nothing like the fumbling fools Kelmz had encountered before . Gently , the DarkDreamer touched Sullen - face , drawing out the hesitant movements of his limbs and his slowcurling fingers . The man 's mouth simpered open , his hands began to stroke downward on his own chest and thighs . He cringed , he melted , he was a fem . Revolted , Kelmz looked away . For himself , he realized , he had 48 Walk to the End of the World hoped to see beasts — real beasts , hot - hided , pungently scented alien beings — not the pathetic perversions of other men . Now d Layo was working on Hak . One - eyed Hak , chief of the crew on the coastal run , tumbled over and rolled on the floor , shielding himself from invisible kicks and blows , yammering . The DarkDreamer seemed to dance over and around him , perfecting the ferryman 's performance with a touch , a whisper , a tug at the sleeve . Kelmz began to shake . He could n't understand the meaning of the upright - walking being that came toward him , sniffed at him , put its hot , smooth touch on him . Panicky , he reared back to escape , but there were barriers . He struck out . The tall - walker evaded him and withdrew . Alone , penned in , he squeezed his eyes half shut and swung his head away from the bright , flaring heat and burning smell . Deep tremors of fear shuddered through him . He swayed from side to side , nosing the air for a familiar scent . There was none . A sound found its way out of his throat , a whimper . He rocked his weight from shoulder to shoulder and moaned out his despair and isolation ; but there came no answering voice . It was day . Close by , a man slept all asprawl , snoring . Another had burrowed his way under a pile of woven mats so that only his haunches stuck out , collapsed sideways over his bent legs . '
18525	18550	18523	18523	Captain	555	' the Endtendant commanded . He was right to give that order , though he was only a Junior . Kelmz stood , blinking . '
18555	18559	18523	18523	Captain	555	' he croaked ; '
18565	18571	18574	18574	him	990	' D Layo was laughing . '
18613	18892	18589	18589	He	990	' SERVAN D LAYO 6 Servan was high as a flag . Each.go - round with manna was a gamble for him ; his tolerance for it was undependable . When it left him exalted he was the victor . He shook the empty bracelet along his arm as he walked . He would have to see about getting hold of some more good stuff , now that he 'd used up his supply on that pack of ferry - punks . The ferrymen had let them off at midday . The three men made their way through the marshes in the still , warm afternoon . The hike gave them time to emerge from the after - effects of the dreaming . Kelmz , in particular , needed that . He was in a black , bewildered mood and walked apart from the others . As for Servan , he held onto his euphoria ; he was practiced in keeping alert enough to function well in spite of his intoxication . That their destination was the fem - center of the entire Holdfast increased his good humor . He had always intended to visit Bayo , in order to fill a gap in his professional background - as he explained several times to his companions , between snatches of song . Inside his head an on - running paean of praise to his own good luck rippled along , woven of scraps of songs he had wrung from various fems who had passed through his hands . Completely unable to produce a true note of his own , he had spent a period of his life pursuing others '
19122	19432	19120	19121	the flutists	999	' indrawn breath sucked up the spirits of dead fems and that it was these ghost - voices which sang so sadly from the instruments . An interesting conceit . Servan was eager to see fems on what must be considered their homeground . Bayo had begun as nothing more than a crude outpost of the City , which lay forty miles inland . The flats between the City and the southern mouth of the river were perfectly suited to the growing of lavers . These freshwater weeds , both tasty and nutritious , grew best in nutrient - rich , shallow waters . So the south channel of the river had been dammed into ponds , into which the City 's sewage was fed . Then stone causeways had been built bestriding the ponds and linking Bayo with the City . Lastly , the structures of Bayo itself had gone up , to house a permanent fem labor force and whatever company of men was assigned to supervise them . Surrounded on the seaward side by the golden grass , the thick crescent of Bayo buildings crouched , compact and unadorned , between the southern margins of the ponds and the river 's mouth where the ferry docked . Bayo 's walls were of mud - brick , fired to withstand the summer rains . All the structures had been erected on a ramp of similar brick that sloped noticeably upward from the dockside warehouses to the farther horn of the crescent , where the pyramidal men 's compound reared up overlooking everything . The quarters of the fems comprised the curved centre . This evening , from the bright - windowed men 's compound came cheerful rills of flute notes and a drum beat reinforced by the stamp Servan d Layo 53 of dancing feet . The Penneltons '
19608	19643	19605	19605	they	169	' fear of them as a presage of aggression and responded by attacking first . Seen in this way , theirs was a reasonable sort of behavior . Servan had a theory that the famous '
19645	19794	19605	19605	they	169	' composure of Senior men was primarily protective , to prevent the unintended triggering of Rovers against the Seniors themselves . Servan had adopted the show of serenity in his own contact with Rovers quite successfully . A man like Kelmz , however , was not to be wasted in a situation like this . Servan waited while Kelmz sized up their position independently and came , naturally , to the same conclusion . The captain made a stay - put sign and moved off silently toward the warehouses . For a big man , he could travel very neatly when he chose to . Servan sat back to wait , turning his mind firmly from considerations of food . They had eaten nothing since morning , and now that the manna - high had worn off , he was hungry . He hummed part of a song concerning '
19812	20144	19605	19605	they	169	' The two Rovers guarding the workroom and warehouse end of the crescent came swinging down the gallery in step , bald - headed and thick - bodied like two rough clay men made from the same mold . That their features could not be discerned in the shadows of the thatch overhead seemed only fitting ; their anonymous madness was their most formidable aspect . Servan knew from experience that they were so nearly soulless , like the mechanical men of Ancient legend , that they were a disappointment to kill unless fully aroused 54 Walk to the End of the World — something that at present was to be avoided . He thought he knew what Kelmz had in mind . If successful , it would save Servan trouble . If not , he would do what was called for . He never liked to plan too tightly for the future . The Rovers wheeled and marched back the way they had come . A shadow rose from the darkness behind them , and Kelmz fell silently into step at their backs . They stiffened visibly , but did n't turn or break stride . Kelmz would be matching their tread so exactly that each of them would hear only his own steps amplified by his companion 's in a manner that he had been taught not to fear , so that he could work as a member of a brace or squad . Servan would have to tell Kelmz later what an artist he was . His praise would certainly irritate the captain — art was a famishing untrustworthy attribute — and at the same time it would have the virtue of being true . Kelmz had an artist 's luck , too : the Chesters were doing their part well , for no one stepped outside the men 's compound to piss or settle a bet . There was no break in the pounding rhythm of the Penneltons '
20160	20622	20155	20155	his	445	' shoulders . He wheeled with them and they came back down the gallery , secured by his authoritative touch . If he had hesitated , they would have turned and cut him down . By the time Servan and Eykar gained the gallery themselves . Kelmz and the Rovers were again at the far end of their patrol , backs turned . The doors to the work - buildings were not locked , for no fern would try to get past a Rover - watch . The two men simply walked in , entering a huge room full of hot , sour air . The cement floor was cluttered with machines , bins , tables , and chutes . At the far end , layers of stuffed hempen sacks mounted toward the ceiling , presumably containing some of the finished product . Most of the equipment seemed to be idle . A few fems were present , wearing sweat - rags bound around their heads and stained aprons that reached from armpit to knee . Three of them stood nearby , fixing a piece of wire mesh over the opening of a pipe that stuck out of the wall . The pipe and the trough under it seemed to be the prime source of the pervasive sour stink . From this group and others came the murmur of voices ; that was surprising . Though normally fems sang at work , the majority of them were held to be incapable of any but the most limited fem - to - master type of speech . Servan d Layo 55 There were no men about at all . This was the first time Servan had ever seen any number of fems together without at least one pair of juniors overseeing their activities . It made his hair prickle . Some signal must have been given ; suddenly every fem in the place acquired a slight stoop or cringe . The faces of the nearest ones went slack and foolish before his eyes . Witchery ? He almost laughed . He had seen a dormful of boys change in just such a way when a Teacher walked in on them unexpectedly in the Boyhouse . One of the fems tending to the pipe came toward the intruders , her calloused feet rasping on the concrete floor . She knelt to kiss the ground in front of them . There were scars on her lean back . Nobody bothered about pretty appearances in the workrooms of Bayo , it seemed . She had wide shoulders for a fem and a strong neck , and she was almost the size of a fair - grown boy . Servan addressed her close - cropped head . '

20647	20697	20643	20645	pleaseyou - master	1022	' she whined , slurring her words in the manner of fems . She sat back on her heels , so that now that he had acknowledged her presence , he might see her face if he wished to . Ts there something this fem might offer these masters ? '
20734	20742	20743	20743	Servan	218	' She can offer her full attention , '
20759	20778	20751	20751	She	1024	' Is there some fem here who 's been in Bayo for the past three five - years ? '

20988	20994	20995	20995	They	5191	' Kelmz shook his head . '
20996	21019	20995	20995	They	5191	're fresh , probably just on duty an hour or so . Nobody will check them for a while . I think they 're

21141	21333	21139	21140	the fems	623	' quarters . Eykar 's eyes , that Servan knew to be remarkably keen and untiring , missed nothing ; but his face remained austerely uncommunicative . Probably he was holding in his disgust . What he had been taught about fems in the Boyhouse ( as Servan knew , having had the same lessons and having had opportunities since to prove them against reality ) was not enough and not even particularly accurate . It was one thing to be told that fems were smelly , misshapen and alien - minded . It was another to be surrounded by them . No fems ever went to Endpath . They had no souls , only inner cores of animating darkness shaped from the void beyond the stars . Their deaths had no significance . Some men believed that the same shadows returned again and again in successive fem - bodies in order to contest for the world with the souls of men , which came from light . It was hard to connect these crude mud walls and their stunted inhabitants with the great witch - fems who had overthrown the Ancients '

Though he had considered dosing a fem with manna as an aid to interrogation , when it came down to it he never could bring himself to waste good stuff on them . In the Holdfast , fems accused of exercising powers inherited from 60 Walk to the End of the World the terrible fems of Ancient times were burned as witches . Here in the dull yellow light of the wall lamps of Bayo , the existence of such powers seemed preposterous . Servan congratulated himself for his own scepticism . Yet , moving among so many of these bent , dull - eyed figures , he was n't sorry to have the Rovers along . Their guide stopped and indicated with a cringing gesture that their goal lay through the doorway to the right . The room beyond was sparsely furnished with clay tables and sitting - blocks . One old fem sat eating curdcake from a chipped bowl . She arose at once and hurried toward them , wiping her mouth and fingers on the hem of her smock so that they would n't have to smell fem - food about her . She knelt in front of Servan . So far , all was in order . '
22501	22579	22489	22489	herself	214	' Servan was no kind of fanatic about fems and their proper place , but by addressing them first this old bitch ( who should have known better ) had committed a serious breach . Kelmz looked ready to break her skinny neck . It was not out of anger but to maintain propriety that Servan slapped her , hard . She rocked back from the blow , but went right on with the same astonishing forwardness : '
22609	22627	22604	22604	they	1129	' The men looked at each other ; Senior Bajerman must have heard about their encounter with the '

23640	23921	23639	23639	Maggomas	185	' son was in trouble in the Boyhouse . The son had been sent to become Endtendant , and Maggomas had vanished . At once , a new scandal had broken . Maggomas had apparently had a lover across the age - line , a Junior Quarterback who was moreover much sought after ( however covertly ) by an Angelist Company Senior superior to Maggomas ; a Boardman , some said . The young man , whose name was Karz Kambl , had also disappeared , presumably to join Maggomas in hiding . Enraged by this turn of events , the Board had passed a resolution barring Maggomas from returning to any company of the City in any capacity . So far as was known , he had never tried to return and had not been seen or heard of since by any reliable witness . And that had been six years ago . The younger man , now a Senior , was said to be Servan D Layo 63 living more or less in hiding in the City . ^s\de from one or two breaks ( profusely apologized for ) when Fossa was called to confer with some fem in the dormitory , the report was a model of concise information , clearly delivered . Servan complimented the old fem on the effectiveness of her intelligence network . She was remarkably well informed . These rumors of an affair had never come to Servan 's notice , possibly because he was too closely involved through his connection with Eykar . He was beginning to be amused by this old fem and was not offended when she went on unbidden : '
23946	23996	23934	23934	he	1164	' She did n't say , favor for favor , but she might as well have , the presumptuous hag . Servan burst out into a delighted guffaw . This episode was more entertaining than he could have hoped . He inquired with exaggerated courtesy into the nature of this '

24192	24211	24189	24189	Eykar	183	' since she was offered to him , and if he still thinks it 's worth the trouble . '
24226	24235	24218	24218	Eykar	183	' What extra aid comes with this gift ? '
24243	24254	24255	24255	she	214	' Such poor help as mere fems have to offer , '
24258	24267	24255	24255	she	214	' Yet the masters may find it useful . '
24411	24419	24420	24420	Eykar	183	' Let 's get on with this , '
24425	24432	24434	24434	Fossa	214	' Please - you - masters , '
24436	24451	24434	24434	Fossa	214	' this fem will go and fetch the one spoken of from another place . '
24456	24463	24452	24452	Servan	218	' We 'll go with you . '
24505	24517	24518	24518	she	214	' This fem feels the masters would be happier waiting here , '

Right at their feet , a hopper was set into the concrete floor . A huge screw - shaft , bedded in a chute , angled up out of it . The screwthread was gleaming sharp , and wedged into the hollows of its spiral were fragments of flesh , bone and fat . Above the level of the men 's heads , a fem stood on a ladder , carefully scraping this detritus into a bucket . The screw - chute led past her to a row of drums mounted on a platform . The drums turned slowly , driven by a crank shaft at which the fems labored with bent , straining backs . Another fem - crew tended the furnaces under the drums , stepping to and fro with scoops of coal over a gutter in the floor . The gutter flowed with a yellow fluid that drained through a pipe from the drums overhead . Fossa put her head close to Servan 's and said at the top of her voice , '
24766	25122	24757	24758	the Rendery	1189	' 8 The Rovers began to shiver and snarl ; Kelmz turned and thrust them back out into the corridor . Eykar , who never ran away from anything , followed the old fem to the end of the central structure . Not to be outdone , Servan went too , dizzy with the effort to breathe through his skin or his ears , eyes streaming . The other side of the machinery featured a broad , sloping table onto which the drums could be emptied . From there , the contents were screw - driven again into an enclosed grinding - mill . On the floor under the mill 's outlet was a conical heap of dark , damplooking particles . A large , tight - woven basket on wheels stood nearby , with ceramic scoops hung from pegs fixed along the rim . Through the half - open lids of the drums , Servan could see fragments dropping from the fixed blades inside back into the churning material below . The end - drum rotated more slowly and loudly than the others . Its lid had been opened completely and fastened back , so that the contents could be drawn out with long - handled hoes . Two fems were working the heavier dregs to the lip of the drum , to be tumbled off onto the steaming hill on the table beneath . Servan 's DarkDream - trained mind made the connection between this noxious operation and what the old fem had said about adding other substances to the milk - food , which obviously would n't be plentiful enough to go around unless it were stretched ; and what more nutritious additive than the flesh of dead fems and of fem - cubs who did not survive the miikery ? What was reputedly poisonous to 66 Walk to the End of the World men , the fems had learned to consume safely , having no other choice but starvation . Some man must have designed the process ; it was too beautiful , too efficient to be a product of the fems '
25143	25327	24757	24758	the Rendery	1189	' thinking . He had to admit , though , that a sort of manly hardness was argued by the ability of fems to accept such an arrangement ; unless they were not hardened so much as merely too depraved to be horrified . Fossa tapped on the lowest of the footplates leading up onto the platform . The fems working up there looked down . She shouted something . The nearer of the two fems went to the edge , handed down her hoe to one of the furnace - feeders below and descended . At the bottom of the steps , she untied a filthy rag from the railing and wiped off the greasy fragments that spattered her skin . Then , stepping carefully over and around the scraps lying on the floor , she came toward the men with downcast eyes . There was no point in trying to speak in these surroundings . When they emerged into the hallway , Kelmz turned from the Rovers and looked the young fem icily up and down , saying with undisguised revulsion , '
25342	25359	25360	25360	You	1193	' The choice of words was unfortunate . Eykar said in a tight , bitter voice , '
25374	25406	25360	25360	You	1193	' Imaginative of him , to see a similarity between Endpath and the Rendery . Still staggered by the impact of the Rendery , the men were moved smoothly through the fems '
25467	25492	25466	25466	Kelmz	166	' uniform as a basic pattern , they transformed the Pennelton Rovers into Hemaways ; Kelmz held the brutes calm in spite of the fems '
25515	26294	26295	26296	cunt nurses	1201	' worn blanks to Eykar 's uniform , were completely reworked or replaced . The one item that the fems could not supply was a manna - bracelet . Since a Senior in charge of Servan D Layo 67 Rovers would certainly be wearing one , Servan grudgingly lent the captain his own . TVie work was done in the kitchen , the only place where the light was good enough and yet not easily noticeable from the men 's compound . From some corner a pack basket was produced , and food was brought . While the men ate lightly of leafcurd and beer , fems filled the basket with supplies for the journey : a white crock of curdcake at the bottom for the fem who would go with them , two jugs of beer , a bar of lamminchew , a square of hempseed bread wrapped in a damp cloth for freshness , and even a small box of dry laver - flakes of seasoning - that last a real luxury these days . There was n't enough to feed the men well for the whole trip , but they were all used to going hungry . What was astonishing was that the fems had access to any amount of men 's food at all . There was also a razor , some earthenware eating gear , a mending kit , firestones and tinder , and a pair of spare sandals that could only be meant — by the size of them — for Kelmz . Fossa drew a diagram on the floor with soot from the cookstoves . The causeways which linked Bayo and the City were easily navigable in daylight , but at night they formed a baffling maze . She drilled the men , ever so respectfully , until they could have picked their way in their sleep . Then she scuffed out the drawing with her heel . The other fem , the young one , returned from washing the stink and grease of the Rendery from her skin and hair . She was introduced as Alldera , the old one 's hold - mate , which meant that Fossa 's master had at some time owned this young fem as well . Whoever he was , he seemed to have interesting requirements in his personal femhold . Both fems could speak ; neither was in any way beautiful , and in addition the young one had been schooled as a messenger . Alldera had one other unusual , visible , attribute : her legs and buttocks were strongly developed ( Fossa lifted the young one 's smock to point this out ) . She had been speed - trained , which was illegal and added to her value . Speed - training was confined to men who specialized in racing competitively for their companies . In any case , no fem should be able to outrun Rovers . Though as a runner she was more fluidly muscled than most labor fems , her looks were not appealing . The wet hair clinging to her head only emphasized the breadth of her jaw and cheekbones . 68 Walk to the End of the World She had wide - set eyes of an unremarkable pale hazel color , a nose that had been broken and healed flatbridged , and a heavy - lipped mouth with a sullen turn to the corners . The best that could be said of her face was that the skin was of good quality , though verging on a Dirty coppery cast . Servan would have preferred a prettier fem , but there were few of them to be had in Bayo . Anyway , as she was she would lend an added touch of authenticity to their group disguise . A fem of no great beauty but specially skilled was just the sort of property that a man like Kelmz might be expected to acquire , once he took his mantle and with it the right to own fems personally . The four of them were to be Senior - Kelmz - and - party come on one of the unannounced spot - checks of work - turf so common lately in the Holdfast . Kelmz would play himself , promoted . Any Penneltons they might encounter closely on the causeways would be unlikely to know that Kelmz had been more or less dumped by his company rather than coaxed at last into Seniorhood . Men assigned to Bayo avoided contact with the City until the end of their five - year , disliking to be called '
26297	26372	26376	26376	Servan	218	' and such by other City men . The two younger men were outfitted in simple pants and tunics , to play the parts of Hemaway Juniors in attendance on their superior . Filling out the group to a properly impressive size , there were the two Rovers as an escort and the fem to serve as pack - bearer . She , the ostensible reason for this extraordinary activity and risk on the fems '
27047	27053	27044	27044	She	214	' Safe journey , masters . '
27054	27068	27069	27069	Servan	218	' Too bad it 's not you coming with us , old dam , '

28007	28069	28082	28082	Kelmz	179	' Tell you what ; since she 's on your mind , why do n't you take her for an hour or so ? You 've been on a wild - beast chase all your life . Try a 72 Walk to the End of the World fem instead , a little dip into mystery , an adventure for your soul . '

Eykar was standing at the parapet ( not leaning , he never held himself slackly ) watching the light fade . He took his final portion of food with a nod of thanks , and ate . He had a tired , thoughtful air that Servan remembered well from their Boyhouse days and was always moved to puncture if he could . '

30153	30681	30151	30152	their dams	1065	' cubs , not men enough to bend the manna to the schooling of their souls . Instead , the manna broke down their feeble counterfeit of manly will , and their souls bled back out into the void . Others could not shake off the phantoms of dreamingshock after waking , and they were never again free of a craving for the drug . They were turned over to the company officers to be trained as Rovers . Those who were orderly in thought and virtuous in spirit , thanks to their years in the Boyhouse , emerged stronger than before and inspired by the visions they had seen . Then there were the borderline cases . Eykar struggled with fever and phantoms for days afterward . Servan almost died . The Teachers pulled Servan back into a lower class , claiming that they meant to overcome his sensitivity to manna in easy stages . Clearly , by degrading him they also intended to punish him for his long history of tricks and insolence . So he spent several years in the forced company of his ageinferiors . He was put through the ordeal of FirstDream again and again , with no better results . All this he minded less than the endless drilling . The harder they tried to sink him into the morass of solemn virtue that formed the Canon of Dreaming Images , the worse his behavior became out of sheer frustration ; meanwhile , Eykar 's natural brilliance was beginning to be recognized , however grudgingly . A great future was predicted for Eykar , despite the stigma of his known parentage . He went on seeking out Servan to debate with him , which only underlined the disparity in their situations . Eventually , in order to alter lys apparently fixed status as permanent boy and non - dreamer , and also to get a rise out of the Teachers , Servan suggested that a Teacher go through a dreaming session with him , giving him word- and touch - cues for the proper images , to guide him past the voidish mishmash of fantasy that he was so prone to . There was an uproar . They thought Servan wanted a Teacher to 78 Walk to the End of the World show him how to DarkDream . They told him twenty different reasons why one did not learn manly self - reliance by submitting to the mental control of others at one 's most vulnerable moment - during dreaming . Then they sent him into iso . Inevitably , sulking , hungry and alone in the dark little cage of a room , Servan made up his mind to try DarkDreaming and find out what it was about . On his release , he made secret trips to Skidro , where he located a DarkDreamer who agreed to dream - gift him in exchange for information about certain of the Boyhouse Teachers . Then Servan asked Eykar along . Naturally , the invitation threw Eykar into a spasm of indecision . In the end , the chance to find out the '
30683	30753	30805	30805	he	1328	' of DarkDreaming proved irresistible , and he went with Servan to meet the DarkDreamer — as an observer only . The DarkDreamer had not been strong enough . Servan had slipped from his mental grip and had begun the descent into mannamadness . Eykar had interrupted the process and forced the DarkDreamer to help him carry Servan back to the Boyhouse and into the care of the Teachers . '
30761	30765	30805	30805	he	1328	' Servan said , '

30912	30987	30911	30911	I	0	'm sure they knew that some Teachers were DarkDreaming pretty regularly themselves , but they had to put on a show of outrage when I named names . They started shouting about burning me , as a throwback to the Freaks . In the middle of it all , with old Varner roaring away at the top of his lungs and blaming everybody around him for the whole situation , I passed out again . '
31083	31155	31156	31156	He	1345	' They tied me up in a hammock and ran me to the edge of the Holdfast and dumped me on the ground . Not a word , nothing . They left me in the Wild to die .

31249	31373	31246	31246	Servan	218	' Eykar , you have a hard heart ! Even you would have been moved , though , if you 'd seen me lumping around in the dust and the thorns , swearing and roaring and bleeding , until the Scrappers came and got me . You know , it 's not true that Scrappers make their living salvaging stray bits of metal and such . Their best source of income is the trade in bondboys . Somebody at the Boyhouse gets paid to tell them when a promising lad — like me — is due to be dumped in the Wild . The Scrappers go and fetch him in , giving rise to all those tales of demons eating up the bodies . '

So a lot of them prefer to turn to some poor young fellow who 's been trimmed to the fempattern , so to speak - castrated .

Servan was pleased that he had n't lost the knack ; he only wished he could see Eykar 's face just now . 10 Servan rested , crouching loose - limbed against the causeway wall . When he caught his breath and lost the cramps in his gut from running so long , he would slip into the City to bring back blanks for them to wear . Their present disguises were useless on the home ground of the Hemaways . He could hear Eykar shifting restlessly close by in the darkness . The more you wore Eykar down , the tighter he wound himself , resisting his own exhaustion . He had run well . Now that they had reached their goal — the edge of the City — he could n't let go and rest , though Servan could hear the trembling in his breathing . There was never any point in worrying about Eykar ; he looked frail , yet he generally proved a better stayer than other men . Eykar whispered , '

34344	35015	35016	35016	witnesses	1447	' descendants to step out of the Refuge into the world again , who had found the surface fit for the establishment of a new civilization . That was the aura surrounding Eykar 's wiry figure in Servan 's mind : the potentiality for mythical action . Eykar 's soul still hid its deepest and darkest dream , and the potential of that dream made him powerful . The man who knew his father 's name might do anything , might even make himself immortal with some immense , transfixing gesture . That was better ; Servan did n't like mysteries . His pleasure was to bring them to light where they could be properly appraised and dealt with . Eykar as a compelling enigma was disturbing , but a man Servan D Layo 87 could play with the idea of Eykar as a legend in the making . Humming , Servan made his way carefully across the workroom to rummage in one of the supply boxes against the back wall under the long wedging - counter . When he emerged from the kiln - yard , whistling a rude parody of a very serious chant about setting manly examples , his mockHemaway clothing had been exchanged for a suit of blanks , and he carried a bundle under his arm . He slipped into the maze of narrow alleys that wound within and between larger blocks of buildings bounded by broad streets and boulevards . The alleys were Servan 's true territory ; he knew his way through them even dream - blinded . Many Citymen did . There were old - time residents who referred to the alleys as the last stronghold of real freedom . Even the patrolmen hesitated to follow a man into this maze where law and its enforcers were given little respect . Few other men were abroad at this pale hour . Whichever man saw another first would fade back and detour through another alley , for few men willingly encountered others in the alleys at any hour . Unhindered , Servan navigated the mazeway of crooked strips of paving and hard - tamped earth . He kept automatically alert for surfaces slippery with streams of stinking leakage from the highwindowed buildings on either side and for scattered shards of crockery that could lay open the feet of the unwary . He would have to arrange a quiet hour or two here in the City with Eykar . Eykar 's fastidiousness was a bitch sometimes . He took things so seriously , and his genuine modesty made him a most trying lover . He had been tense and moody during their nights in the crowded confines of the ferry . The City would be the place for the leisurely loving he needed to steady him down ; not entirely , of course - part of his charm was the necessity of seducing him all over again , to some degree , each time , defeating him into pleasure . Thinking along these lines , Servan nearly strode right out into the Street of Honor . He caught the sounds of whips snapping just in time and checked himself in an alley - mouth . The entire street on which the alley opened was cordoned off with two red ropes . A meager crowd loafed along the sidelines ; two bored - looking patrolmen leaned on the corner - posts , and the weapon - lenders were packing up their wares . Inside the ropes , a bout between two overstuffed Seniors was dragging to a close . 88 Walk to the End of the World Sweating and shuffling , the duelists were merely lacing each other 's paunches with delicate lines'of welts . Servan had seen a man skin and strangle an opponent with one of those thin whips . These men were apparently settling some minor matter in public to enhance their standings . Each had come with a group of friends — '
35017	35086	35016	35016	witnesses	1447	' would have been a more accurate term — who looked on with various degrees of embarrassment . Servan stood still , watching with an educated eye . He did n't intend to give the audience a chance for some better diversion . Even in the innocent course of crossing on his way to somewhere else , any man was fair game to any other 's challenge , once '
35091	35671	35016	35016	witnesses	1447	' as they said . The red ropes were moved every night to some unknown new location , so that no man , in anticipation of a challenge , could go look over the ground beforehand for his own advantage . Standings were made and broken by a man 's reaction to finding the red rope stretched unexpectedly across his path . Servan had no time for standings this morning , and no desire to be conspicuously framed in red for every curious eye . He would have to make his way around through the alleys . With a shock , he spotted Senior Bajerman 's round , imperturbable face in the audience . Picturing the Senior 's astonishment if suddenly confronted by Servan , he grinned to himself . It would be a surprise for Eykar , too , to be handed over to the Hemaways . A cart loaded with sand was being drawn down the street by a sweating fem - gang . One of the patrolmen waved them to a halt . The drover , a Hemaway Junior , swore at the sight of the red rope , and began harrying the fems into an about - turn , blasting away on his whistle as if he hoped to deafen the whole street . He would have to take a considerable detour to get that vehicle down to the glassworks at the end of the street where , Servan recalled , the Hemaways were working this five - year . So that was what Bajerman was doing here , up so early ; he was taking a break from supervisory work . And that was what Servan was doing here , too , having chosen this particular short cut without even thinking about it . Confronting Bajerman had been at the back of his mind all the time . It was an example of the bravura style that the City ( home , after all , of a sophisticated and appreciative audience ) always inspired in him . In this case , it went dead against his own interests . He had no Servan D Layo 89 desire to abort Eykar 's grand gesture ; he wanted to help bring it about , possibly even help to shape it , and that was n't a satisfaction to be traded for cheap City thrills . Besides , some easy treachery or other was probably just what Eykar expected from him . Spitting in the eye of expectation kept others baffled and Servan himself flexible . All of this meant nothing , next to the simple , terrifying fact that he simply could not betray Eykar . The attraction of their boyhood was gone , replaced by something darker and stronger . As a DarkDreamer , what Servan read in the thrust of his own pulse and the tightness of his breathing was that Eykar had him in bondage . He could think of Eykar in any terms he liked , interpret and reinterpret , seduce him , torment him — but he could not knowingly choose to destroy him . The right image came at last : Eykar was a comet , blazing with the effort to hold together through the aching void long enough to win the right of surcease — aware , alone , and desperate . Servan was enraptured with Eykar 's brightness ; to embrace Eykar was to bathe in fire . I 'm

37084	37719	37720	37720	he	1464	' 96 Walk to the End of the World Bek restrained an impulse to say something — anything — that would hold the captain back . Servan was more slippery than wet clay and could make his way out of any situation , but Kelmz was the sort of capable and steady man who caught the trouble that Servan 's kind avoided . With a crisp word of command , Kelmz brought the Rovers to their feet . He set them side by side in brace - position , patted them down to check their gear and started them off toward the City before they could get restless . Kelmz captured by patrolmen , Kelmz brought before the Board for treachery , complicity with a renegade Endtendant and a notorious DarkDreamer - Bek looked up and realized that he must have been dozing . The sky was brightening . He stirred . He was uncomfortable . His body , which he thought of disparagingly as a sort of bestial enemy , had stiffened with hard traveling after the days of inactivity on the ferry . He identified the separate naggings of hunger in his belly , a stitch in his side , and a blistered heel . Every time the fem sniffled or moved so that the pack - basket scraped the causeway stones , the blood jumped in his veins . He concentrated on watching the City solidify with the predawn light . From what he could see , nothing important had changed . The backs of the outer buildings were haughtily turned on the stinking southern approach , which was dominated by the sewers that fed the laver - ponds . The City stood high on the compacted ruins of previous flood - broken settlements , so that the causeway simply joined the streets without any change in elevation . North and west , the City 's thoroughfares sloped down toward the river , which swept past on its way down from Troi to Lammintown and Bayo on the coast . Tall levees rose neatly alongside the river . From causewayheight , Bek could see a string of flatboats heading downriver , awnings flapping in the early breeze . The wind changed , bringing the sound of the City 's bells loud and clear over the laver - ponds . There was the flat - nosed call of the Blues , the tinkling scale of the Angelists , the rough tocsin of the Quarterbacks with the cracked end - note , and the others in their turns . None of that had changed either . Someone whistled . Bek squinted and picked out a figure in one of the dim openings between the warehouse walls . It was Servan , in blanks , waiting for him . j Eykar Bek 97 Patrolmen should have been watching the cleared perimeter under the outer walls , but they did n't like the smell of the south side and neglected it . Bek could hear the fem 's steps at his back as he crossed , a hasty , fearful pattering . No challenge rang down from the rooftops . The bundle Servan carried was a secbnd suit of blanks , more patches than cloth , two sizes too large and very dusty . At least he 'd brought a face - mask and a voice - filter in the old style of truly anonymous dress , so that Bek would n't have to risk showing his face openly in the street . While the fem went off at Servan 's command to dispose of the pack - basket down a side alley , Bek changed his clothes . Servan watched , oddly restless and uneasy . " Where 's the captain and his brutes ? '
37740	37752	37753	37753	Servan	218	' And you did n't try to keep him with you ? '
37756	37774	37753	37753	Servan	218	' Did you consider the possibility that he might go straight to Bajerman or to the Board ? '
37792	37797	37782	37782	Bek	183	' He wo n't . '

37959	38593	37953	37957	a bunch of Hemaway Rovers	1471	' Often during their shared youth Servan had led forays from the Boyhouse during hot summer noons , when the Teachers napped , or in blue - shadowed winter dawns . With him , Eykar had spied on Senior residences , prowled the Market Arc for carelessly fastened shutters and doors , tracked fems on the streets and furtive denizens though the alleys . The familiar landmarks were still there — a patch of broken paving near the brick - yard , a wall that had become a 98 Walk to the End of the World palimpsest of rude inter - company insults , the profiles of certain corners — but an odd , expectant quiet lay over everything . At the Market Arc , a paved mall under a roof of weathered grass mats , all the stalls were closed . The Arc divided the smoke and noise of the factories from the core of living - quarters on the other side . This morning no streams of work - bound Juniors poured across . Only one group of gaunt - faced young men of the Squires Company was swinging along , and they had the look of all - night carousers on the way home . The far side of the mall was bounded by the blind , spike - topped walls of the company compounds . The gates , with the company symbols painted brightly on them , were shut . Beyond the compounds , there lay spacious individual residences to which wealthy Seniors might repair when they had one or two friends with whom they wished to lead private lives . The alleys here were neatly kept footpaths serving the back entries to these homes . The scented air seemed to mute even the chiming of company bells . Low voices and occasional laughter drifted from balconies and sheltered garden corners . Crockery chinked as Seniors took the morning meal in the dignified leisure to which their mature spirits were entitled . Bek was not as impressed as he had been in his youth . Since then he had seen venerable men shamble into Endpath , weeping into the wide sleeves of their pilgrim robes . Turning in at a grillwork gate , Servan had a low - toned altercation with the Quarterback who guarded it . This suave young man insisted on scoring him off with insults and disdain before deigning to deal seriously with him . The Quarterback finally took Servan 's bracelet to show to the master of the house as identification of the three callers . He returned shortly and dropped it back into Servan 's hand as he sulkily motioned them inside . His scowl was a good sign ; it meant that he had been rebuked for making a welcome visitor wait . They crossed the rock garden behind the wall and walked under an archway built through the body of the house , to be faced with a curious tableau in the inner courtyard . Some fifteen fems were ranked silently in rows across the polished flagstones . They wore long hair , indicating that their owner was rich enough to scorn selling their scalps to the fur - weavers . And they were covered with markings that could only be tattoos : stripes , Eykar Bek 99 spots , even fine striations like the hair of beast - pelts , as if they were beasts instead of fems . Here was a decadent use of the tattooing crak , the proper purpose of which was to imprint rank - signs on the shoulders of men , not designs on the skins of fems . Among these creatures moved a stubby man who pulled at his lip and squinted anxiously into the fems '
38633	38672	38625	38625	He	1472	' Servan , what a pleasure ! You 've come in time to lend me your good taste . I need to pick the fem that would make the best gift to the dreaming - hosts this afternoon . '

38730	38759	38760	38761	The man	656	' is unthinkable , of course . But to show up empty - handed , for a man of any standing , would be even worse . . . '

38990	39022	38987	38988	Eykar Bek	183	' For an instant the Senior 's smile stiffened . Almost at once , however , his expression warmed back into what looked like genuine hospitality , and he responded courteously , '

41782	42956	41777	41781	Young men in the Seniors	1578	' entourages eyed each other , from group to group , with haughty disdain . They were Juniors who had found favor in the eyes of elders important enough to flout the agerules , though never so openly as at these ceremonies . A Senior 's patronage brought sure meals , gifts of clothing and even sometimes of small items like jewelry that might be traded for rations later on , when the patron 's favor had been withdrawn . In recent years , competition for Senior protection had grown fierce among young men handsome or clever enough to have good prospects . They Eykar Bek 107 watched each other for signs of slippage , sharp - eyed to press for their own advantage with a generous Senior or one likely to go to Endpath soon and leave property to his favorites . It was always this way in lean times ; there had been lean times in the Holdfast for over a decade now . Later the less fortunate Juniors would come , grouped by company in sullen ranks , far from splendid in the work clothes which was all most of them had . They were more in need of the comforts of dreaming than those who had gone before them . A man in a dream felt no hunger . Bek remembered the appropriate stately pace , and in the same moment remembered who had taught it to him : Senior Bajerman of the Hemaways . He began looking for faces he knew and forgetting his salutes , which brought him cold stares from older men trying to identify him so that they could mark him for one of their young friends to challenge in the Streets of Honor at a later date . The suit of dress - blanks that Kendizen had furnished Bek included only a domino - type mask , but Bek was n't nervous about being recognized . He 'd been through that on the ferry . He felt , rather , exhilarated by the pageantry around him . The square opened ahead of them . Every eye turned to the tables set up before the Boardmen 's Hall and the figures standing beside them . Kendizen and his fems moved on with the crowd . Bek and Servan , with Alldera at their heels , cut swiftly to one side and into an alley , making for the Boyhouse on the south side of the square by the back way . Nothing about the Boyhouse had changed ; not the ease of slipping in unseen , not the sweaty redolence of the hallways , or the glimmering floors of the classrooms . The open cubbies lining the corridors contained the same sparse crop of personal belongings : a bright bit of cloth , a clay top or comb , a string of clay bells . In the corners of the classrooms , lecterns loomed under their burdens : books of the Ancients , chained securely down . Portions of these books were read aloud over and over , until each boy could repeat what he had heard word perfect . Some said that most of the Teachers could n't read either , but it did n't matter . The books were only the palpable authority behind the lessons . Bek had been a fanatical and gifted memorist , taking possession of the heritage of men like a starveling at a feast , chewing everything 108 Walk to the End of the World over and over . He 'd been a great one for the forms of things in those days , uneasily putting aside the discrepancies of content that he had occasionally perceived . For instance , once he had made the connection : all boys learn how to get in and out of the Boyhouse unnoticed when they want to ; all men have been boys ; all men know how to get in and out of the Boyhouse unnoticed if they want to . How terrified he had been over that , fearing that his father would come soon to kill him . He had conceived a gripping horror of dreaming , because instead of the stylized patterns he studied , he kept slipping off into fantasies of flight from invisible pursuers and of struggles with huge intruders bent on devouring him . It was n't even possible to tell the Teachers about it , because they would have suspected a penchant for DarkDreaming — for which they had no cure , as Servan 's case so clearly illustrated later on . Bek cured himself , with patience and self - control . When this hysteria ( and the sweaty bout of illness that its banishment cost him ) had faded , what remained was the suspicion that much if not all of men 's civilization was built on secret foundations that no one ever hinted at , let alone discussed - unarticulated agreements that might even run directly counter to the rules that were spelled out in the Boyhouse . Not that it mattered in the long run . Bedrock truth , he had come to understand later , was found only at Endpath . He no longer believed that the purpose of the Boyhouse was to teach the truths that made men out of boys . It was to impose discipline . How unpleasant it had been ! These corridors were normally either empty as now ( but reverberating to the chanting voices of classrooms full of boys on either side ) , or filled with lines of boys shuffling in lockstep from class to class with downcast eyes . Sometimes they were turned out into the halls to walk up and down after a whole morning of sitting and chanting , before returning to an afternoon of more of the same . They always had to wear those wretched grass sandals that could barely be kept on , so that moving quietly was impossible . Even upstairs on the dorm floor , where boys lived naked to be reminded of how like beasts and Dirties they were , the first thing to do on being wakened in the morning was to slip into those sandals ; and woe to the boy whose enemy had kicked his pair away down the floor during the night . Always there would be a Eykar Bek 109 Teacher nearby , and even the ones who were most bored and impatient with Boyhouse work were alert to the sound of whispering among the ranks , or of bare feet on the worn and polished tiles , or of blows and gasps when a couple of boys surreptitiously tried to settle a feud . And then there was the ceaseless gnawing of hunger in the gut . Only later did a boy learn that the deprivation he had been taught to regard as valuable discipline was a constant factor in the lives of most Holdfast Juniors . '
42962	42967	41777	41781	Young men in the Seniors	1578	' the Teachers said . '
42989	42993	41777	41781	Young men in the Seniors	1578	' And again , '
43005	43009	41777	41781	Young men in the Seniors	1578	' And again , '
43029	43359	41777	41781	Young men in the Seniors	1578	' There were lots of punishments , and whatever a boy was caught doing reasons were found to punish him for it . Most often , the culprit was docked a meal . Those who finally turned their backs on punishment forever by giving up and turning their backs on life were deliberately forgotten . Their names were erased from the Boyhouse ledgers . By and large , a boy settled for hating his Teachers ( and shining up to those who had food to spare for favored boys ) ; stewing in guilt over steamy affairs with older or younger boys ; betraying other boys to Teachers and to each other ; and generally passing on all of the grimness of Boyhouse life that he could to boys who were junior to him . The Teachers knew all this . They said it was better than in Ancient times , when boys had been left to their filthy dams to raise . ( Was it any wonder they had turned Freak , and attacked their own fathers ! ) Ah , the stories , the threats , the casual insults and deadly hatreds ! Incredible , Bek thought , that one lived through it . At the doorway to the Deportment room , he paused . There were lines painted in white on the floor ; they shimmered in the sunlight striking in through the clerestories . The lines marked out patterns of precedence in the meetings and dealings - together of the various ageranks of men . Under the tutelage of Bajerman or his like , boys learned to keep the proper distances , and to present the proper expressions , stances and salutes for this or that encounter . Bek 110 Walk to the End of the World remembered practicing the correct manner of approaching the Endtendant at Endpath . History gave the reasons ; Deportment instilled the behavior . He could still recite the chant called '
43362	43481	43483	43483	you	1583	' , which described some long - lost game in the archaic language . There was no proper manner , however , of being an ex - Endtendant . Bek saw his own reflection glimmering at him from the wall - wide mirror , spare , straight - backed , even elegant in the understated trimness of dress - blanks . He seemed a model of the Cityman , a successful graduate of the Boyhouse ( he who had never graduated ) , the body - brute triumphant . No wonder he had n't been recognized in the street , even only half masked . He scarcely recognized himself . Servan 's reflection came and stood beside his . '
43486	43495	43483	43483	you	1583	' Servan said , with mock - nostalgia , '
43563	43575	43549	43549	he	239	' He grinned and put his arm across Bek 's shoulders . '
43598	43875	43579	43579	you	240	' Trust Servan to bring everything down to its lowest level . Their double reflection looked out of the shadowed glass , like the manly lovers Bek had seen in a fine glaze - painting once ; the peer - couple , handsome and well matched , linked faithfully together from boyhood on in spite of all obstacles and partings , like two heroes of a love - chant . They were in reality a parody of that ideal . Bek 's education in love had begun in the Boyhouse , as was common . Though frail of build , he had often been called to the Library to help with the heavier drawers and bins . As he was setting an armload of books back onto the shelves , he would hear the sound of squeaking wheels as a book - cart was drawn across the end of the aisle , guaranteeing privacy . In theory , inter - age sex was banned by Boyhouse rules . Adults were supposed to confine their love affairs to their own peers , and so were younger men . In this way , those who were more mature avoided the possibly corrupting influence of younger , less masculine lovers . In practice , many Teachers seemed to seek out such corruption , and not always against the will of the boys they preyed upon . EykarBek 111 There were men who later claimed that their first contact with true , manly love ( as opposed to the counterfeit kind represented by a fem 's bewitchments ) had occurred under the influence of beloved Teachers exercising what were known as '
43878	44502	43579	43579	you	240	' . For Bek , the Library had been the scene of his first contact with aggressive lust , and his experiences had not stopped there . Among the boys themselves there were similar conventions , copied from their elders . Those who had been most intrigued , and perhaps most frightened , by Bek 's singular parentage used the crudest possible methods of proving themselves unshaken by his presence among them . Through such forced encounters , Bek had first learned to differentiate between his treacherous , lascivious and vulnerable body and the outraged spirit trapped inside it ; and he had learned to hate . At Endpath , he had had to school himself to give the cup without a tremor to men whom he recognized from those times ; they came to him in pilgrim gray . The only one he had truly dreaded to see on the Rock had been Servan , because Servan was the only one to whom both body and soul had responded — still responded . Even then , Servan had had the awful integrity of a DarkDream ; his actions rose cleanly from the pit of his being through the medium of muscle and bone without the slightest distortion by scruple . In other words , he did what he wanted without any concern for why he wanted it or the effects of his actions on others . He seemed subject only to the objective limits of possibility , within which he gracefully made his way . In the Boyhouse he had bent the rules where he chose , creating spaces of comfort around himself and those whom he protected . He 'd been a hero to some , for that . Many had felt the beauty of his ruthless , uncomplicated egotism . To Bek , he 'd been ( and remained still ) a shameful but irresistible indulgence . Bek had thought of him oftener at Endpath than he had admitted that night on the causeways . Now he could have laughed , remembering how he had tormented himself with images of Servan in the hands of vengeful Teachers ; Servan mutilated , starved , destroyed . Look at him , with his sleepy , knowing grin , his easy selfassurance ! At the deepest levels of his soul , there were no conflicts to wrench him apart . His effortless coherence kept him alive and flourishing while everything around him fell to pieces . Contact with him was like the promise of immortality . Perhaps it was that 112 Walk to the End of the World completeness , at base , that the body - brute loved . The buoyant , confident Cityman who stared back at Bek from the glass was simply his physical self infused with Servan 's assurance and vigor . This was the price : each time Servan lay with him , beguiling him with comfort and delight , the carnal being became more real ; the farseeing and austere soul gave ground . Deliberately , Bek moved out from under Servan 's arm . With a grin and a shrug , Servan followed him on down the hall , picking things out of the wall - niches and replacing them in the wrong openings . He knew this morning - after remorse for what it was worth . At the end of the corridor , light shone under the tall double doors to the Library . Those lights were never all blown out , day or night . Images and records of the unmen were kept here . Darkness was the element of their kind , and though all of the unmen were dead except the fems '
44659	44668	44669	44669	Steel	242	' Looks like there 's been a fight . '
44711	44718	44719	44720	the captain	445	' Nothing to get excited about , '
44738	44827	44719	44720	the captain	445	' eyes were on Bek - an eloquently sympathetic glance . Kelmz had passed this way too , in his own youth . Having discarded the false mantle somewhere , he stood simplyclad as any Junior despite his lined face and gray hair . Because of this — or because in traveling together they had used the age - rank EykarBek 113 structure as a tool and a disguise instead of as a system of truth , or because of the havoc wrought in this hated room by Kelmz '
44867	44879	44880	44880	He	166	' You two are late , the dreaming 's already started . '
44891	44894	44882	44882	his	166	' If you 're
44909	45386	44882	44882	his	166	' The square was packed with a crowd asway with solemn , silent movement , above which floated the voices of the chanting boys and the smoke of the witch - burning which traditionally opened the dreaming ceremonies . The bodies of three fems , the conventional number , were angled sharply out from posts set into the central trench . They were already contorted and black in the grip of flames that could scarcely be seen in the bright daylight . Bek flinched from the sight of them . He had always had that reaction , an involuntary sympathy rooted deep in the body - brute . He forced himself to look again . On both sides of the smoking trench , long lines of men moved at a slow gait toward the Boardmen 's Hall at the end of the square . Heavy earthenware tables had been placed on the steps of the portico . Behind each table stood a Senior of the Board , his head and shoulders massively framed by a high - starched mantle of office . Each of them had a company bellringer in attendance , whose present job was to dip up manna - beer from the well in the table top and pour it into the cupped hands of each dreamer in turn . The man would drink , have his hands dried by the same young bell - ringer , and then kiss the palm of the Senior of the Board by whose grace he dreamed . He then would pass by to enter the Hall and find his assigned cubicle , where he would lie on fine matting to dream his heroic , soul - strengthening dreams . Fems and Rovers were carefully locked away for the occasion , while the entire population of men in good standing dreamed . Although men did not lawfully dream together , all had their dreams at the same time . When everyone had been served , the Seniors of Board would have the ringers drink , drink the last themselves , and then go in , closing the tall doors behind them and leaving the streets of the City empty . 114 Walk to the End of the World The voices of the boys were muffled by the thick , bubble - specked glass of the window , but by the rhythms Bek knew what chant they were doing . His memory supplied the words : the names and characters of the unmen , who were only properly spoken of under the bright noon sun at a dreaming . Having just done the beasts , they were telling the names of the Dirties , those gibbering , nearly mindless hordes whose skins had been tinted all the colors of earth so that they were easily distinguishable from true men : '
45413	45433	45403	45405	Ragheads , Niggas	243	' They chanted the Freaks , commonly represented as torn and bloodied by explosions their own bombs had caused : '
45461	45526	45440	45444	Faggas , Hibbies , Famlies	1602	' the last a reference to the soft - minded values of the Freaks , iron being notoriously less strong than steel . Finally , the chant came to the fems , huge - breasted , doused in sweet - stinking waters to mask uglier odors , loud and forever falsely smiling . Their names closed the circle , for being beast - like ( '
45532	45546	45448	45452	Junkies , Skinheads , Collegeists	1604	' , as some old books said ) they had been known by beasts '
45549	45585	45586	45586	Cancer	227	' Bird , Cat , Chick , Sow ; Filly , Tigress , Bitch , Cow A counter - chant was being raised now by the Teachers , enumerating the dreadful weapons of the unmen : '
45604	45625	45592	45592	Zinc	249	' The floor underfoot seemed to vibrate as the passionate voices reinforced each other with righteous power . Servan said , '
45632	45906	45592	45592	Zinc	249	' 13 Bek remembered standing with the others on the Boyhouse roof , staring at the billowing smoke , and chanting . The smoke stank ( it was by that same cooked - flesh stench that he had recognized the purpose of the Bayo Rendery ) ; but the boys breathed it joyfully . It was the smell of evil being punished as no boy could ever be punished , for only witches were burned , and only fems were witches — always excepting , of course , the special case of DarkDreamers , but what boy ever imagined he would be one of those ? The chants naming the wickedness of the Ancient fems were always shouted with extraordinary venom by the younger boys , who were closest to the separation from their own dams . The older boys were privileged to bellow out the list of the virtues of men , virtues which fitted men to master fems and boys in the name of order . Most boys of any age never came close enough to fems to observe their dreadfulness personally or knew many truly decent adult men among the Boyhouse Teachers ; but they were convinced , and they chanted their throats raw . Bek thought of gray - robed pilgrims stumbling along the narrow trail that led out over the black peninsula of stone to Endpath . The intervening step — that of walking to a dreaming at the Hall as one of the adult brotherhood of the Holdfast - was missing from his own experience . Watching now , he felt less substantial than the coiling smoke . '

46252	46285	46286	46286	He	218	' Most men do n't go so far as to dream that they literally are beasts themselves . That takes a degree of imagination that I would n't have thought Kelmz had . '
46289	46357	46286	46286	He	218	' You 'd be surprised at the level of most DarkDreaming ; I was . I used to think everybody used it the way I wanted to , to give imagination free rein and really dig down into the spirit . Well , men do n't ; or else imagination and the core of the soul are mostly so petty that it 's hardly worth the bother . '
46359	46445	46446	46446	Bek	183	'm good at my work , mind you . I could give my clients beasts more marvelous than any that ever really lived . I could give them gilded courts of power and splendor , steel cities roaring with wealth and crowds . But the quality of the dream depends on the visualizing capacity of the dreaming mind that I have to work with . Most of them are pretty puerile - as you must have noticed , back there on EykarBek 117 the ferry . '

46699	46818	46651	46667	the nasty little men who live inside our grandest , most noble - natured and mature brothers	1617	' Bek paced , thinking of the ambivalence of men 's attitudes toward Endpath and the man who brewed deathdrink inside it , s black stone walls . A peaceful death in the mists of dreaming , under the assurance of eternal remembrance in the Chants Commemorative , was said to be a good thing , worth striving for . Yet men came shaking to the Rock , babbling their sorrows in spite of the rules . And after they drank , they were no less dead than those who died outside , unremembered . The Endtendant was custodian of perhaps the most important ceremony of Holdfast life , and he was served as such . Though the companies '

47583	47599	47580	47580	Bek	183	' Must I drape myself gracefully over the furniture in order to talk with you ? '
47600	47670	47580	47580	Bek	183	' All right , I admit it : in you , ease would be an affectation . But you ought to learn to be more appreciative of comfort , Eykar . Why are you so enamored of hard edges and sharp corners ? If I did n't know you better I 'd say you were in constant danger of falling asleep without a bit of pain here and there . '
47723	48143	48145	48145	they	1648	' Servan was watching him with that connoisseur 's look , appreciating the effects of his words . Bek tightened his lips and said nothing . Shrugging , Servan shook the knife down out of his sleeve again and entertained himself by carving spirals into the plaster of the Library wall . The spiral was the sign of the void , of fems , of everything inimical to the straight line of manly , rational thought and will . It would infuriate the Teachers to find that symbol here tomorrow , not least because within an hour the boys would be terrifying each other with whispers that unmen - spirits had visited the Library during the dreaming and had left their mark . Bek looked around at the pictures scattered everywhere . As a frequent visitor to the Library in his Boyhouse days , albeit under duress , he had seen some of them before . Then how was it , he mused , that he had n't noticed that the fems in the pictures were not particularly huge breasted , nor magically alluring as the chants said ? Some did seem to have a red stain on their lips that might have 120 Walk to the End of the World been blood , but actually it looked more like the paint that Kendizen 's pets wore for decoration . To tell the truth , many of the fems in the pictures did n't look much more dangerous than Alldera — less dangerous , in fact , since they seemed much softer in body than she was . And here was a picture of a long - striding lion ( the label was torn off , but he remembered the beast - name ) taking what appeared to be a companionable stroll , not with some witchy fem or even a young Freak , but a white - bearded man of mature years . Baffled , Bek frowned at the pictures . Could he have been so blind with his terrors of this place as a boy that he had looked without seeing any of this ? Then what of the Teachers ? How would they have explained these extraordinary images ? No wonder Kelmz seemed shaken , even aged by his hours alone here today . What esoteric mysteries were hidden here , passed over and tucked away by men who had no use for anything but the simplest , crudest evidence supporting what they taught as truth ? '
48148	48222	48145	48145	they	1648	' Servan said , sliding off the sill . Kelmz had eased open one of the heavy doors , and Senior Kendizen slipped inside . Behind him came another Senior , who wore a high , fine - spun wig which forced him to bend in order to enter without knocking it off . In a hasty whisper , Senior Kendizen made introductions . When he came around to Kelmz , he said , '
48248	48328	48329	48329	I	0	' And he smiled his rueful smile . His companion he presented as Dagg Riggert , an old Angelist whose name Bek knew to be an important one . Senior Riggert studied Bek in critical silence . Looking into the man 's deep - seamed , haughty face , Bek recognized the beginning lines and colors of illness . He thought , pain will bring you to Endpath soon . The thought made him feel older than the Angelist . '
48337	48342	48334	48335	Karz Kambl	216	' Senior Riggert said . '

48784	48827	48781	48781	Riggert	252	' Vengeance is owed to my friend Karz , though he would n't say .so himself . He has an open and forgiving nature — perhaps a trifle too much so , like Senior Kendizen here - and would no doubt have Maggomas '
48869	48895	48928	48928	He	183	' Was that what moved this fierce old man , jealous rage at having been robbed of a lover ? Anger with himself for accepting Maggomas '

49005	49059	49002	49002	he	252	' Just now , we have only the interval of the dreaming in which to deal freely with Karz . If he thinks it 's to protect Raff Maggomas , he 'll tell you where to find him . Can you think up a story that will put that appearance on your questions ? '
49060	49066	49067	49067	Servan	218	' Nothing simpler , Senior , '
49070	49075	49067	49067	Servan	218	' Let 's go . '
49076	49080	49081	49081	Kelmz	179	' One thing , '
49084	49107	49081	49081	Kelmz	179	' Seniors , when you came in , were the streets clear ? Is everyone but the boys inside the Hall now ? '
49108	49126	49127	49127	Riggert	252	' All but a handful of young rowdies who were turned away for arriving half - drunk , '
49132	49150	49127	49127	Riggert	252	' They 'll have staggered off to keep each other company somewhere until the silence is over . '
49154	49250	49151	49151	Kendizen	237	' There is a rumor that some young Tekkans went up to the Rock , and that one of them swam up a vent - pipe and let the others into Endpath . So it 's known that the Endtendant , far from having barricaded himself in , has left Endpath and is at large . Possibly the young men we saw were only feigning drunkenness and are actually on the watch for suspicious movement in the City during the dreaming — in hopes of capturing the renegade , and with him some extra points .

The two Seniors put up their mantles to hide the sight of the empty , sunny streets . They hurried ahead , unmindful of the dust swept up by the hems of their dress - mantles . The stillness oppressed them . Bek had developed a taste for stillness at Endpath , and he would have liked to walk alone and slowly . But Kelmz worried him . He dropped back to walk with the captain . '

49880	49902	49867	49867	He	252	' he said , and strode off down the length of the room . To the others , Kendizen said tensely , '

50084	50091	50073	50073	He	216	' Rejoining them , Riggert said , '

50175	50193	50173	50173	her	1705	' Kelmz pointed at the fem , who was skulking in the darkness of the great doorway . '
50206	50246	50247	50247	She	1705	' Riggert said . Servan went and spoke to her . She hesitantly took a place on one of the long , cushioned couches — a small figure obscured among the blocky shapes of seats and tables around her . '
50257	50261	50247	50247	She	1705	' Servan said , '
50309	50391	50271	50271	her	1705	' On the other side of the screens , a group of blank - suited men , masked , walked in a long oval , chanting . They paced gravely , not looking at one another or at the newcomers , for whom room was made in the line without apparent concern for age - standing . The chant consisted of a set of lines extolling the world as a fitting place for men , watched over by a benevolent Being : '
50440	50813	50814	50814	I	0	' Bek , taking up the words describing a deity who peeped in at the world of men like a boy at a keyhole , could scarcely keep from smiling . The rest of the ceremony was not at all amusing . Now and then a man would leave the line and go to kneel before a figure seated on a block between two small braziers in the ashes of the high - arched hearth . The figure was a horror : the body was hidden in a robe of dull red and yellow patches , but Bek could see that one arm was drawn up in a twisted crook against the chest , while above it cheek and shoulder were squeezed together on a seal of scar - tissue . The face was an unreadable snarl , wound tightly around the off - center vortex of the one milky eye . He had seen such deformities at Endpath and could scarcely credit that a man would choose rather to live on in this state . Involuntarily , he thought of the fems he had seen burned today in the square ; they were surely better off than this ruin of a man ! Senior Riggert stepped forward as others had done and knelt before the burned man . He reached out and took the figure 's one sound hand between his palms : a lover 's gesture , simple and direct . Kneeling so , he spoke in loving treachery . Bek , watching , felt his own flesh creep . When Riggert rose , the burned man spoke aloud . 126 Walk to the End of the World Bek did n't understand a single word , but the cultists did . The chant died . Swiftly and in silence , the line of men filed past the burned man , who briefly clasped the hand of each of them . Then all dispersed ; the Hall doors closed with a soft booming after them . The visitors were alone with the burned man . He spoke to them . Bek watched his fire - scarred mouth , and this time , despite the distortion , he made out the meaning : '
50815	50827	50933	50933	He	1713	'm told that a young man , a friend of Raff Maggomas '
50833	50854	50933	50933	He	1713	' Servan stepped forward , bowing his head in an appealing manner that suggested pride and independence struggling with awe . '
50862	50867	50868	50868	he	1713	' son and myself , '
50875	50920	50868	50868	he	1713	' was betrayed by him and has become a bond of debt . He turned me over , in my moment of weakness and boyhood foolishness , to my enemies . I 've lived an outcast since then . I owe him for that . '
50983	50988	50989	50991	the burned man	6518	' Who is that ? '
50994	51001	51002	51002	Servan	218	' A true friend of mine , '
51083	51131	51132	51132	He	216	' Good . It will help you to do well what you have to do , if your friend is looking on . His presence will remind you of what is best in yourself . A man 's revenge should never be polluted with spite or cruelty . '
51196	51245	51247	51247	he	216	' You understand , I owe Eykar Bek , too ; but my grudge is not personal , like yours . It 's only that by the Law of Generations he is the first and most dangerous enemy to my first Eykar Bek 127 and most precious friend . '
51250	51253	51247	51247	he	216	' Dagg ? '

He seemed to have hardly any contol of his lips at all and probably did not even feel the moisture , the scar - tissue being insensitive . With an audible sigh , Kambl used the cloth to blot the shining film from his face . Servan , to Bek 's sardonic amusement , looked rather dismayed . He was accustomed to grotesqueries more figurative than literal through DarkDreams or to quick , straightforward and bloody reality . A prolonged nightmare like this shook him up . But he caught up the thread of his performance again . Briskly , he said , '
51413	51436	51267	51267	he	251	'm afraid the danger to Raff Maggomas from his son is more than theoretical now . Are you under the impression that I 'm

I was at Bayo with the Quarterbacks when Raff came down from Lammintown . He was bitter about his troubles there . He 'd been trying to reorganize some phase of the way the Tekkans were handling the weaving shops , and he 'd been making some headway — and then the scandal about his claimed son broke , and his influence was wiped out , though the rumor was never proven . I do n't think he ever got the chance to answer the accusation formally . '

He said the Seniors were too soft anyway , not men enough to be really intent on Reconquest , which was his goal . He wanted to explore the waterways south through the marsh , looking for solid land to be the site of a new town , a base for expansion beyond the present borders of the Holdfast . He spoke of winning back our pride by winning back the world . It was very exciting . We liked to think of ourselves as new heroes , turning our backs on everything we hated : our Seniors , the Rovers , the marshes , the smell and sound of fems around us all the time . . . '
52193	52308	52186	52186	he	185	' Toward the end of that five - year the lavers failed again . Raff was enraged to see the fems being decimated for witchery in retaliation . He said they were n't to blame and that killing them was a stupid waste . That got him into more trouble . Some of the Seniors began saying that he had brought the blight with him , that he was in Eykar Bek 129 league with the fems . But he was tough and clever , and he got back to the City with us at the end of that unhappy five - year and began working to amass new power — which he did . '
52435	52486	52422	52422	he	1731	' He needed a helper for the journey and asked me to come . It was amazing , to travel so swiftly and steadily against the current of the river ! A fire burned in the machine . I remember wondering if that signified some holy tie with the sun . '
52505	52553	52501	52501	he	6518	' The trouble was , I had no aptitude for mechanical things . Also , those were full - moon nights that we traveled . Maybe the Moonwitch was watching , remembering the machines of the Ancients that had violated her in the old days . . . '

It was the silence , they said ; it was the endless series of empty tablelands stretching away north and south , and the mountains rising in the west . They said the Wild was worse than the sea , which at least had a patterned motion . On a windless day in the Wild , all a man could think of was the stillness of the void . When there was wind , so much the worse . It sounded like the sighing of the countless men lost in the Wasting . Or , men sometimes said in lower tones , like the whispers of the ghosts of the vanished unmen , stirred up by the intrusion of living men who chanted as they came , to drive away either sound or silence . Men were romantics , of course — they could afford to be — and they loved to magnify the significance and danger of anything that happened to them . With considerable effort , fems had gleaned from them over the years some useful information about the Wild . The land beyond the Holdfast appeared to support no life whatever , other than spiky trees and a mixture of hardstemmed grasses that were of no use to men . The wood raiders carried provisions with them , but there was water which men could drink . Sometimes they went rogue afterward , and it was claimed that spirits fouled the springs and streams in spite of the care men took to recite the Chants Cleansing before drinking . As for ghosts and demons , few but the most humble and credulous fems believed these to be anyting but mental creations of the men themselves . As a rule , men hated most those they had most wronged ; it followed that they hated — and therefore feared — their ancestors '

63494	63614	63476	63477	Senior Bajerman	174	' I was once fond of you , Eykar . I thought you had great promise . For the sake of our past closeness , I 'll put these ravings down to the effects of your wound . As for this DarkDreamer , I think I have a place for him quite close to me , for which he should be grateful . He needs lessons in behavior as badly as you do , since what was taught to you both in the Boyhouse evidently did n't take . You should count yourself fortunate in finding a qualified Teacher to help you correct your errors . We 'll hold class in the camper for you two as we travel . '

63791	64651	63768	63768	your	2085	' 18 The morning was already spent when Alldera joined the carrycrew . By midafternoon a dark and gritty wind began to bite at them from the west . As they ran , the carry - fems showed her the rhythm that was least tiring , how to balance the load over her spine and let her hips do the work , how to fold her carry - cloth on the run so that it provided the test padding under the yoke . The trouble was that she did not have the strength to support her share of frame , canvas , and the weight of three male passengers . The carry - fems were built square , for lugging heavy loads . Alldera was long - muscled for fluid motion . Eventually , she fell . The others managed to keep the camper from dropping and crushing her . They prodded her with their feet when Senior Bajerman descended from the camper , but she could n't even draw her legs under herself to rise . It made no difference ; her mission had ended when fems began dying in the City , for the Pledged would be the first to be killed . She only hoped that these men would cut her throat cleanly , rather than break her legs and leave her there , as some drovers did . It was a mercy that her eyes were so puffy from squinting into the driving dust that she would hardly be able to see the knife . Standing over her , Senior Bajerman did not draw a knife . He said that it was crowded in the camper . He had been told that this fem was speed - trained , and he was not going to let such potentially valuable property go to waste ; that would be unmanly . She would ride in the camper where she could attend Eykar while she got back Alldera 159 her strength . Perhaps a man running with this crew of hulks could make them put some decent speed on . Bajerman would go on foot outside with his men , he said , and observe the performance of Alldera 's replacement : d Layo . The DarkDreamer was pushed into position , and the Hemaways slung Alldera into the camper . The dim interior smelled of Bajerman 's perfume , for the ceiling - vent had been shut to keep out the blowing grit . Alldera crawled into a corner and huddled there , too cramped to move or speak , drawing painful breaths of the stale , sweet air . The camper was lifted and carried into the teeth of the wind . A man 's voice , hoarse and panting , struck up a stepsong concerning the foolishness of old men who insisted on showing off their dwindling physical powers to younger companions . D Layo was singing . Later , in the blowing dusk , the carry - crew staked down the camper into tent form for the night . The Hemaways fashioned a rough shelter for themselves of their mantles and staffs a short distance away . The fems were left within the bare area between the two structures , where Hemaway sentries could keep an eye on them . Alldera was thrust among the carry - crew for the night . She squatted stiffly and used her carry - cloth as they used theirs , as shelter from the wind . She had not slept ; the Endtendant had not said one word to her all afternoon in the camper , but she had n't dared to doze off for fear of being punished for inattentiveness . Now the carry - fems took turns kneading the ache out of her shoulders , back and legs . A bald one , scalped too closely at some time by fur - weavers , offered her the moist center of a portion of curdcake , keeping the tougher skin for herself . In a tight circle , using their hip - packs of provisions as cushions , they settled for a night of shared warmth . The carry - fems began to hum , weaving tone and amorphous rhythm into a plaintive , wordless request for a song for the dead one . Every song needed one fem in the group who knew the words , and could sing them under the camouflage of gutterals and trills set up by the others to mask the sense of the song from men — most of whom could follow softspeech if they tried . Alldera was not a singer . Her work had been largely solitary and not conducive to music . But her trained memory had retained every song she had ever heard . 160 Walk to the End of the World She sang a mourning song for the slain carry - fem . It was an uncommon one ; she had never heard all the words , for some of them had been lost . She loved the tune , however , which was unmistakably grieving : '
64663	65320	64661	64661	Ann	265	' When that song was finished , the carry - fems kept up their vocal pattern , building on the mournful melody . Alldera wondered if some inkling of the meaning of Bajerman 's remarks had gotten through to them — that the massacre of fems had already begun . All the carry - fems and Alldera herself had come very close to dying by the bridge . They owed their lives — for however much longer they would be permitted to keep them — to Senior Bajerman 's judgment of their usefulness . It was unfair for her to be left with a bunch of carry - fems who could scarcely comprehend the dimensions of the disaster and of her own failure . They were not the type with whom she would have chosen to spend the last of her life . They smelled and were dimwitted , and they looked to her — foolishly , in her opinion — for leadership . And so ? A dead bitch is a dead bitch , what difference whether she had brains or not ? What use had Alldera 's brains ever been ? She might as well be one of these carry - fems as not . They remembered their dead , at least , in spite of the brutality of their lives , and showed kindness when they could afford to . If these poor scarred hulks wanted songs , she would sing for them . She began with the traditional singing - invocation , relating how men continually brought their own houses down on their heads and then looked around for someone else to blame . With the beasts and the Dirties all gone and the idea of gods discredited as a femmish hoax , there was no one to blame these days but the fems and their young . The words asked for strength to bear the blame . Alldera sang them ironically , using the shortest form , and then swung into the jeering rhythm of songs mocking the Ancient men for the brainless greed that had perverted their inventiveness and strength . These songs told of rotten water , ravaged hills , air made unbreathable by noxious gases , cities uninhabitable because of the noise of machines - all of it , the product of the men 's own wonderful knowledge and their obsession with breeding more sons on their fems . Dying of the men 's assault , the Ancient world had rotted , and Alldera 161 its decay had released poisons . The first to die had not been the men whose avarice for the riches of the world caused it all ; they had had wealth with which to buy protection , while there was still protection to be had . It was the beasts who died , all unknowing ; and it was the Dirties . Those of the unmen who realized what was happening and rose up to fight , the Ancient men slaughtered , using flying ( ires and earth - smashers that only compounded the damage suffered by the world . At last , seeing their own kind falling to the increasingly widespread and indiscriminate destruction of wars and poisons , the leaders of men had bravely made the choice of sustaining themselves in the Refuge so that mankind would not utterly disappear . The carry - fems slapped their knees to make the beat for the mock - heroic songs that told of the Holdfast - making : how the descendants of the world 's murderers had stepped out into the open again to build a new life on the bones of the dead and the backs of their fems . In the time - honored manner , the descendants had become heroes in their turn by pursuing and exterminating the pitiful creatures that had survived the Wasting outside , the so - called '
65322	65340	65346	65347	The descendants	6805	' . So the river - plain had been claimed for men again , from the hills behind '
65348	65413	65414	65414	Heroes	6806	' courage had been rewarded . They had found life - sustaining gifts of the sun on which to nurture their society . There were the edible seaweeds , the metal mines , the pits of coal for fuel , and the hemps for food and fiber . Not to mention the last gift , the docile compliance of fems in their own suppression . '
65416	65421	65422	65423	The unmen	1056	' the songs mocked . '
65478	65663	65465	65465	You	2100	' The formal closing of this sort of history - cycle was an admonition to all fems who heard : choose your hatreds with care , seeing how the men have become all that they hate ! And then came urgings to patience , promises that the men would find their sanity and humanity again in time . Meanwhile , fems must keep themselves sane and fit to meet them again as people when the time- came . The way to fight your enemy is not to become like him , they said . Alldera could no longer even finish the words . She broke into 162 Walk to the End of the World another song instead , one that asked how was it that the fems the leaders saved from the Wasting accepted degradation instead of swallowing their tongues and suffocating in defiance ? Every one of the carry - fems huddled against the wind knew the answer to that , for it was the first and last lesson dinned into all fems by the Matris : for the survival of the race . '
65671	65708	65465	65465	You	2100	' Alldera added , hoarse with hatred . She too had learned to snivel and whine and creep softly about in order to stay alive . She ended with a proscribed song called the Cursing Song : '
65802	66014	65797	65797	we	2107	' The carry - fems were n't happy with that ; it made them uneasy . They let their accompaniment lapse when it was over and curled up to sleep . The wind had died . From the camper came intermittent sounds of conversation , even laughter . Alldera lay awake a while , wondering if the femmish songs had been sung for the last time tonight . In the morning , there was a shadow on the plain behind them . It was Oldtown , the remains of an Ancient City . They had missed the hemp - stink and the rumble of machinery because of the previous day 's wind . Over decades , fem - gangs had been brought in to strip the site of usable materials . Scrappers had scrounged furtively after them . Nothing remained but heaps of rubble among which a complex of water - mills had been built to catch the strength of the river and to use it to help process the hemp harvested from the plains . Morning also revealed the distant , hurrying figure of one of the Hemaways , who was making for the town . He must have had enough of traveling that empty road toward an uncertain reception in '
66272	66274	66269	66269	He	183	' I 'm
66284	66972	66269	66269	He	183	' Oh , these conscientious types , she thought . He needed an excuse to exercise his rage because he was ashamed of it . Instead of coming right to the point and beating her because her expression had angered him , he would give her orders and watch for the least sign of insubordination - which he would find , one way or another . Then why play the game of submission ? In a convulsive gesture , she turned the pitcher upside down , and its cold contents splashed out over the bed . He jerked his legs back with a gasp of pain , rose onto his knees and wrenched the pitcher out of her hand . He raised the pitcher over his head , his face twisted with fury . Alldera fell back . She spread her legs and clawed up her smock with both hands in the last , mindless defense : when threatened , present . For an instant , he hung over her ; then he flung himself down on her . It took all her concentration and skill to help him carry through his assault . He was clumsy and in pain , and when he entered her , she heard his groan of mortal terror . Their coupling was painfully dry for her , but brief . Almost at once a strained cry burst from his throat . He pulled away and rolled onto his stomach in the sodden bedding , his ribs pumping in and out like a blown runner 's . 164 Walk to the End of the World Mechanically Alldera took stock : one sleeve was half - torn from her smock ; a bruise was swelling warmly under the skin of her left temple ; there were other aches and abrasions , none serious . She finger - combed her hair and blotted her sweaty face on the skirt of her garment . A fem must never offend a master by appearing messy if she could help it . She thought what a good thing it was that she had never joined the Pledged . Let this man , not much taller or heavier than herself and wounded besides , only raise his hand to her and all her courage disappeared into the habits of survival like a rock into a swamp . A clever fem sometimes needed a reminder of her true position , and there was nothing like a good swift fuck to set firmly in her mind her relation to the masters again : the simplest relation of all , that of an object to the force of those stronger than she . Fem , she thought , you only think you think . The pitcher the man drinks from does not think . The camper that carries his weight does not think . She felt hollow in body , which was fitting in one who was merely a receptacle for the use of men ; and she felt hollow in mind , for there was nothing she might imagine , feel or will that a man could not wipe out of existence by picking her up for his own purposes . Any fem drifted helplessly , awaiting their actions and desires until one of them inadvertently authenticated her by seizing her to himself — if only to run an errand or repeat a phrase — for an instant . That she could have a mission , a direction of her own — or that others like herself to whom she was in some way bound could — was an absurdity . A man 's usage conferred existence . But this man did n't know his part . He should have ignored her or briskly ordered her to change the bedding , signifying that the incident had no importance for him . Instead , he surged back onto his knees , though the pain drove the blood from his face , and he took the front of her smock in his hands and shook her so that her teeth snapped together . '
66985	67042	66983	66983	you	2123	' The question was unheard of . If a man intended to breed , it was assumed that he did so unless interfered with by femmish magic . Breeding was a matter entirely out of the control of fems , who came into estrus as time demanded . Panicked by his agitation , she stammered automatically , '
67052	67053	67045	67045	Alldera	290	' '
67059	67068	67045	67045	Alldera	290	' he said , giving her a shake . '
67079	67112	67045	67045	Alldera	290	' He had gone rogue ; he was going to kill her . Her head was full of flarings of blackness from the violence of his handling . She could n't speak . '
67118	67173	67045	67045	Alldera	290	' he cried , and flung her backward against the end - wall of the camper . One of the carriers outside staggered at the sudden shift in weight . Alldera lay where she had fallen . She 'd bitten her tongue and tasted blood . Very low , the Endtendant said to her , '
67220	67262	67215	67215	they	2128	' songs are nonsense . They also taught that coupling with a fem outside of the breeding - rooms is a dreadful peril , and here I am , no different than before ; so maybe the songs are not nonsense . '
67281	67291	67264	67264	you	2125	'm fed to the teeth with tricks and lies ! '
67325	67336	67337	67337	she	6377	' The master has heard all the songs I know , '
67354	67357	67337	67337	she	6377	' I. I. '
67385	67390	67391	67391	he	2125	' No more songs , '
67394	67418	67391	67391	he	2125	' One version of the past seems as likely as another . Tell me about now . Tell me about your own experience . '
67646	68490	68509	68509	she	2148	' capacity for language was generally so limited that they must not be confused by exposure to any more words than the basic command and response phrases . Learning to speak more than the minimum was a risky maneuver . Alldera described the care she had taken to disguise her natural aptitude , so that it would seem to the men of Bayo that her verbal achievements were entirely to the credit of her trainer . Otherwise they might suspect witchery , by means of which she would be supposed to have raised herself so far and so fast above the norm for her kind . She had made her trainer work to discover her mimetic abilities and her grasp of the structure of complex speech . A pity , they had said , that she was n't pretty enough to be trained as a pet , some of whom were taught to tell stories and jokes in an entertaining manner . The Bayo men had altered her diet to improve the quality of her hair and skin , and they had succeeded to some extent ; but she would never be pretty , only presentable . So they had taught her how to memorize messages , how to find her way from place to place , how to identify other men than her master by clothing , mien and surroundings , and how to present a message properly . Then came the wonder of her first trip from Bayo to the City on a barge with a dozen others ripe for the bidding of the companies ; the glory of the highstanding City , paved streets after mud - walled Bayo , and the majestic and terrifying peal of the company bells , which she had taken at first for the voices of monsters clanging out over the City . She spoke of her pride in being selected to serve an important Senior ( to a fem fresh from Bayo , all Seniors were important to an equal , exalted degree ): Senior Robrez of the well respected Squire Company . How impressed she had been with the size of his femhold : a private squad of seven fems under the domination of Fossa , who at that time had been only a year away from discard . At first , Alldera had not perceived the sly politicking among the other fems of the hold , the jockeying for favorable positions from which a lower fem could hope to vault into Fossa 's place once it was vacated . Gradually , young Alldera had recognized the aping of men 's hierarchical concerns among the fems , even though rank for them could only 168 Walk to the End of the World be a pretense ; no real power - beyond the reach of a master 's whim - accrued to any femmish position . Then there was Senior Robrez himself . With time , his pomposity , his pettiness and his spite had all revealed themselves , and the godlike virtue of masters ( real masters , not trainers brutalized by life in Bayo ) had been toppled forever in her mind . She told how Senior Robrez had had her painted up one night as a pet , so that he could humiliate an unfavored guest by assigning a hideous fem to attend him . Delightedly , the other fems had decorated Alldera for the occasion , not permitting her to see herself or to guess the true purpose of her assignment to personal service that night . Only later , in the privacy of the guest - alcove , she had glimpsed her Own face in the surface of the water she brought the man for washing . They had lacquered her hair into a spiky crown ; her skin had been covered in blue and green spirals ; and her lips had been made up into a great bruise - colored weal . No wonder the guest had regarded her with such disgust , once they were both hidden from the amused eyes of others . After that , Alldera had redoubled her efforts to acquire the speed skills that Senior Robrez had hired a man to teach her . Her trainer had been a Skidro derelict who had once trained young men of the Squires Company to race in intercompany games . She remembered the good pain of pushing herself to the limit , the wind of her own speed ( though her steps only brought her around again to her trainer in the end ) . She stopped speaking . She had n't meant to tell about that last part ; it was a private thing , and therefore treasured . She remembered the glory of racing through the streets of the City early in the morning or late at night alone . That the messages she carried were most often trivial ( plaints of love and jealousy , protests at infringements of standing , claims on others '
68705	68708	68709	68709	he	685	' And ? '
68712	68723	68709	68709	he	685	' How was it that you were returned to Bayo ? '
68724	68729	68730	68730	she	2148	' To Oldtown first , '
68733	68739	68730	68730	she	2148	' for work - discipline . '
68743	68758	68730	68730	she	2148	' What is there for a fem with your talents to do in Oldtown ? '
68759	68769	68709	68709	he	685	' Nothing . That 's why it 's discipline . '
69297	69323	69283	69283	she	290	' plan and getting on with it . . . She had fallen silent , thinking of these things . The Endtendant was watching her . '

69455	69548	69556	69556	Alldera	290	' But I saw a fem bolt in Oldtown . It was early in the morning . She just put down her beating - stick , took off her apron , and ran . The men sent Rovers to pull her down and kill her . Work was held up for a while so the men could watch and gamble on the result . The rest of us paid for her moon - madness - the moon was up that morning - by having to work double time until her replacement arrived . '
69549	69555	69556	69556	Alldera	290	' Why did she run ? '
69558	69565	69556	69556	Alldera	290	' Fems are creatures of impulse . '
69566	69569	69570	69570	he	2179	' Nonsense , '
69573	69597	69570	69570	he	2179	' That 's obviously the last thing you can afford to be . Did Rovers guard you there on the Oldtown work floors ? '
69598	69640	69556	69556	Alldera	290	' No , they patroled the perimeters of Oldtown , more on the watch for Scrappers than for escaped fems . Where we worked , the noise and activity of numbers of us would have put Rovers too much on edge . '
69641	69658	69556	69556	Alldera	290	' Yet Captain Kelmz held those two Penneltons in the depths of Bayo without evident strain . '
69659	69690	69570	69570	he	2179	' He was a first - class officer . We had few of those at Oldtown . The companies like to keep them home in case a skirmish is called . '
69691	69706	69556	69556	Alldera	290	' You fems can tell a good officer right away , ca n't you . '
69707	69765	69556	69556	Alldera	290	' It 's important to us . At Oldtown , we could even spot Rovers trained by Kelmz . He turned out clean killers , quick , accurate , no hesitation or flailing about . It 's worth the effort for fems to know roughly what kind of behavior to expect from a given brace of Rovers . '
69766	69771	69772	69772	he	2180	' Like the Juniors , '
69777	69801	69772	69772	he	2180	' though most young men would not be pleased to see the similarity . You ca n't have enjoyed traveling with Captain Kelmz . '

In carefully chosen generalities she sketched the explosive style of relations among people whose lack of security intensified their loves and hates to extraordinary levels . There was no time among fems for the ripening of delicate affinities . Fems went where their masters 172 Walk to the End of the World went , often without warning or time to send messages of farewell to lovers in other femholds . Did this man feel sorry for himself because his friend d Layo was inconstant in adversity ? Alldera told of betrayals , disfigurements , even murders among femmish lovers . '

Even among her own lovers and friends she had never had any one to talk to like this . There had never been any security , any time , even when she found another fem with true verbal facility . This was her first experience of speech as self - expression with any degree of complexity , eliciting responses of similar quality . It gave her an extraordinary feeling of power , of reality . That was the danger . 20 They camped on the upper plateau for the night . D Layo brought over his fellow - prisoner 's ration of food and stayed while Bek ate . Then he announced Senior Bajerman 's invitation : that the Endtendant come and sleep in the camper tonight . Bek , sitting wrapped in his blanket against the highland chill , shook his head . '

70603	70609	70610	70611	The Endtendant	182	' Did he do this ? '
70626	70750	70610	70611	The Endtendant	182	' No . That 's from lugging you half the length of the Holdfast . I ca n't get the trick of padding the yoke exactly . Bajerman does like to beat on me a bit , but I do n't mind that as much as I mind not being able to wash up at all . He seems to get a thrill from dust and sweat ; I do n't remember him having been like that back in the Boyhouse , do you ? And then that reeky stuff he wears gets all mixed in , I can hardly stand the smell of myself any more . You should be grateful that I have n't made a run for it , Eykar . '

70758	70776	70610	70611	The Endtendant	182	' What , and leave you to Bajerman ? He 'd be on you in a flash . '

She looked up once and saw him watching her hands with the same steady , straight gaze she had seen him turn on Kelmz , Bajerman , even on d Layo . He just looked : not for what was gratifying , not for Alldera 175 what was useful , not merely to fill time or distract himself from less pleasant matters , but to see what was there . For a moment , she let her imagination fly , thinking , what could seeing eyes see in her ? Anger . Beyond that - anger , grief for her helpless dead — she could n't see herself . It was no wonder . She , after all , had no experience with that sort of looking . She could not afford to attend to anything other than what was helpful to her own survival . Her hands drew away the pad of cloth , revealing the glistening wound . '

Her master questioned her , could n't get a sensible answer , had her beaten and forgot about it . She was valuable property , a speaker and fine looking . Later , when the Boardmen started asking questions about this story of Raff Maggomas and his claimed son , her master remembered that identifying mark . She was older by then . He turned her over to the Board , and they burned her . '

The second sun was Troi itself , whose concrete buildings were sheathed in the flattened , polished bodies of Ancient machines extracted whole from the mines — the single boast of wealth that the Troimen allowed themselves . After dark '
73472	73569	73381	73382	the master	1164	' Troi took light from the river , men said . Looking at the brilliance of the lamps burning all along the roads that ran north to the coal pits and south to the mines , Servan believed it . Those were no coal - fueled flames . One could say it was witchery , except that it was the work of men . The supply roads were empty now , though the purpose of the lights was reputed to be to enable a constant flow of fems to bring coal and metal to the furnaces of '

The river , which fell steeply from the hills behind the town , ran through the center of it and on away east to Oldtown and the City . 182 Walk to the End of the World The lower slopes on either side of '
73749	74036	74039	74039	himself	2275	' Troi furnaces . Across the lower valley , a palisade of metal plates had been newly erected , shielding the town from the rest of the Holdfast . Heavy metal grills set into this barrier blocked the river to traffic . The north and south river - roads were shut by similar gates set into the palisade just outside the eastern margin of the town . The carry - fems set the camper down in a riverside loading - yard in front of one of these steel grills . A concrete tower had been reared behind the palisade . From the upper tier of the tower men could be seen looking down . Standing well back from the palisade , the Hemaways offhandedly pointed out this and that about the new fortification to each other , as if they were all Rover officers and veterans of every skirmish ever fought . Senior Bajerman held himself aloof from the discussion . He regarded the sunset rather than the town , while Servan helped him adjust his wilted and travel - worn mantle to maximum effect . Even without starch , the folds could be arranged to frame the Senior 's face and head , giving an impression of extra height and bulk . The taller you stand , Servan thought , the more pleasure to bring you down . He hummed to himself . Eykar got out of the camper ( he would n't be caught like that again , all tangled up with the fem ) and braced himself firmly upright , one hand on the roof - frame and the other on Alldera 's shoulder . And how he stared when a gray - haired '

What interested Servan was something the Trukker carried in one hand : a dull metal tool , pointed like a finger toward the ground . A weapon , Servan thought , if he had ever seen one . A dozen paces from the camper the '

The noise stopped ; the voice of the Trukker could suddenly be heard , roaring abuse at the men in the tower . Ribbons of smoke dissolved in the air overhead . None of the Hemaways had even reached the palisade . One carry - fem still tried to drag herself into the sheltering grass , leaving a smear of blood on the flagstones behind her . Bajerman stood stupefied ; beyond him Servan could see Alldera crouching under Eykar 's white - knuckled hand . '
74543	74570	74421	74426	Other ' Troimen along the palisade	7058	' the Trukker was bawling at the men in the tower . Red - faced , he turned back to the newcomers who were still standing : '

Servan thought , am I a fem or a cub to stand shaking in front of this old - wolf because he wields powers he ca n't even control ? He said , '

74896	75010	74872	74872	I	0	' the Trukker said . Servan stepped between them , turned on Bajerman and did swiftly with the knife things he had been dreaming of doing . The Senior shrieked and staggered backward . Belly slit , red hands knotted into his groin , he fell twitching on the flagstones . Servan knelt to wipe the thin film of pinkish blood from the Trukker 's blade , using Bajerman 's mantle . The knife was a good one , with a full new blade and a handle of some hard substance ribbed to give a grip . He pivoted , still crouching , and offered it back with some reluctance to the Trukker . '
75020	75025	75026	75026	He	2298	' the Trukker said . '
75030	75037	75026	75026	He	2298	' Eykar held out his hand . '

Servan shoved him down the incline . Sloshing noisily up onto the flagging , the water took the Senior and tugged him away . The weight of his stained , soaked mantle dragged him down . Servan dipped his bloody hands into the water . Two Troimen from the tower were searching the dead Hemaways for weapons and private caches of food . Servan considered Destination 185 demanding that his own knife — or some other , in its place — be returned to him . It would look better , though , to enter Maggomas '
75642	76083	75640	75641	The Armicors	275	' metal - tipped boot heels snapped against the floor . 186 Walk to the End of the World Stairs led up onto a railed gallery that ran high along the wall of a huge , roaring room . The room was lit by the familiar warmth of firelight — but what fires ! The entire wall opposite the walkway was a tangle of metal tubing , struts and plates in which a row of revolving kettles was mounted . The giant kettles glowed red with heat and thundered as they turned . Men in helmets and heavy clothing moved around the machines , carrying long , fire - blackened rods with hooked ends . Others bent or climbed to examine glassfaced dials , making notations on tablets fixed to their sleeves . They spoke with their heads close together amid the tremendous noise . In front of a lighted doorway at the far end of the gallery , a man leaned out over the railing , pointing and shouting at someone down on the work - floor . There was imperious vitality in his stabbing gestures , though he was the first really old man they had seen in Troi . His close , curling hair was like a design tightly engraved on silver . From beneath his long apron of shiny material there emerged limbs as lean as ropes . His voice , keen and reedy , was audible even over the rumbling of the machines . A whistle shrilled . On the work - floor men tipped one of the kettles with the bent ends of the long poles they carried . Liquid fire spewed out , with darting sparks and a sharp crackling sound . A man poked black scum from where it gathered in the spout and obstructed the outpouring . The hot , glowing stream turned dull red as it congealed in channels in the floor beneath . In the air a fresh pungency tingled . The Trukker strode out ahead and spoke to the old man , who turned , glancing first at Servan . With an abrupt gesture , the old man waved them forward . For a moment , Eykar hesitated , his expression a study . Whatever he had been expecting , Servan thought , it had not been this skinny , axe - faced old fellow ! And he would not have missed the sobering of the old man 's eager look when the Trukker pointed out that it was Eykar , not Servan , who was the Endtendant . Father and son would have to revise some preconceptions . '
76087	76100	76101	76101	you	2335	' shouted the old man over the noise of the turning kettles , '
76102	76118	76129	76129	Maggomas	185	're injured — not too badly to keep you off your feet , at least . '

It was all going to be worth every famishing step of the journey and more . Legends ? They would be gods . Even Eykar 's beautiful , absurd pride would have to bend before the superb artistry of events . Destination 189 Maggomas thrust open the door on the far side of the bridge and led them into a suite of littered rooms . There were papers and books everywhere . Lop - eared drawings and charts hung from the walls . There were stilt - necked lamps clamped to the desks and tables , one even to the back of a chair , so that beams of light crossed each other at every angle through the dimness of the rooms . '

77632	77684	77629	77629	Bek	183	' Not at all . It 's a very sensible custom . In the old days a man used to have a son to take over his property , further his plans and generally see to the honor and the prosperity of his bloodline , after — when the time came . '

That 's important , if a great lifework is n't to fall into the hands of quarreling louts or idiots . And idiots there are in plenty , no matter how carefully you try to weed them out . Take the lads I 've been training here ; they still turn in trash like these reports . '

When the Board decides that there are too many restless youngsters around for the maintenance of stability , it 's not difficult for them to manipulate the standings or break up certain love affairs , so that pride and misery send a number of Juniors off to die at Endpath . Dueling in the Streets of Honor takes care of others . '
78772	78832	78844	78844	he	2402	' The point , young men , is to prevent the Junior population from growing large enough , rich enough or educated enough to burst the boundaries of the Holdfast , begin a real Reconquest — and perhaps turn around afterward and take the Holdfast for themselves , with their newfound strength and confidence .

79254	79258	79239	79239	He	439	' Well chosen , '

He dried his hands on a stained rag from his pocket . Several small , colorless objects fell from the rag 's folds , clicking and bouncing on the table top . Maggomas off - handedly explained that they were cubes of something called '
79473	79556	79390	79390	Maggomas	278	' , which the Ancients had made out of coal and other substances . He had recently produced these samples from the leavings of the Oldtown hemp - mills . He shot a sly look at his son as he spoke of this , but Bek spared the intriguing little objects scarcely a glance . He kept his eyes on his father . D Layo was the one to pick up the cubes and juggle them on his palm . He rubbed the '
79558	79599	79390	79390	Maggomas	278	' surfaces and remarked wistfully and with awe on the powers of the Ancients — and again his eyes turned toward the guns the Armicors wore . Maggomas sniffed at the soup that had been set in front of him . '
79603	79654	79390	79390	Maggomas	278	' he said , and ladled some for the men and a bowlful for himself . Alldera was relieved that none was served to her ; the soup had dark , shiny shapes in it and a musty odor . The young men sat and looked uneasily at their portions . '
79662	79666	79667	79667	Maggomas	278	're talking about , '
79670	79788	79667	79667	Maggomas	278	' when you glibly rattle off a phrase like " the powers of the Ancients . " They were men of might , not scrabblers in an ash heap . Listen , just as an example : the Ancients had so many fibers , natural and man - made , that not only could a man change his shirt every day ; but they even had to put labels in their garments , to tell the owner which of the many methods of cleaning was appropriate to that particular fabric ! Extend that kind of versatility into all fields , Destination 195 and you begin to get some idea of the wealth and power of the Ancients . '
79789	79792	79793	79793	Bek	183	' Yet , '
79798	79803	79793	79793	Bek	183	' they were overthrown . '

79823	79841	79811	79813	the old man	5261	' and next you 'll tell me that it was by the magical powers of her kind ! '
79842	79944	79945	79945	He	5261	' Let me tell you something : the Ancients were n't overthrown ; they fell down — in their understanding of their own incredible powers . They should have forseen the Wasting soon enough to have prevented it . Ancient science was so far advanced that they had machines to do the work of the Dirties , artificial foods and materials to replace those they had from plants and beasts , even manmade reproductive systems that would eventually have cut out the fems from their one supposedly necessary function . But the men did n't see where it was all leading . '
80089	80096	80217	80217	he	183	' The science of the Ancients , '
80107	80208	80217	80217	he	183	' was so highly developed that they were about to cut through the tie of dependence on this mortal bitch of a world altogether and become gods — not your famishing mystery - god who passes understanding and coping - with , but real , rational , deathless gods wielding real , rational power . The Ancients invented artificial body parts and anti - aging drugs that would eventually have made sons themselves obsolete . Who needs posterity when men are immortal ? And given eternity , they could have discovered everything else that there is to know or do . '
80221	80282	80217	80217	he	183	' You can see that the fems could n't have that . They were committed — still are - to an 196 Walk to the End of the World endless , pointless round of birth and death . They knew that once they were no longer needed for reproduction they would be dispensed with altogether . So they attacked first . '
80290	80298	80217	80217	he	183	' he asked , with sudden solicitude . '
80394	80411	80416	80416	he	2440	' If neither of you young men minds , I 'll have your fem fed now . '

80539	80658	80536	80536	Bek	183	' The basic sustenance of the new Holdfast , and of the world in times before even the Ancients . It 's a low - energy , high - bulk food , but an old and honorable one . We make it not from leaves like our curd - cheeses , but from the seeds of mature grasses : " grain " , it 's called . We 've already raised two successful grain crops in the high meadows west of us — without the Board 's knowledge , of course . In time , the whole upper plateau will be given over to grain - growing . That 's our first step , when we take over . '
80659	80669	80768	80768	Maggomas	278	' Then where will you grow manna - hemp ? '
80673	80684	80671	80671	Layo	218	' Or is this " grain " good for dreaming ? '

80694	80727	80689	80691	the old man	5261	' Mind melting , you mean ! Men with a whole real world to explore wo n't have any use for dreaming . There will be no manna in the new Holdfast . '

80822	80869	80819	80819	Maggomas	278	' have n't you any ambition to be more than a DarkDreamer , scrambling through the alleys from one cheesebrained client to another ? That 's no life for an able young fellow . I can offer better . You lived to come through the gates of '
80891	80916	80819	80819	Maggomas	278	' D Layo smiled and began some modest disclaimer , but the Armicor officer strode over at that moment and pressed the spyglass into Maggomas '

It gave my men a chance to try the new weapons before any major clash , and we were relieved of a lot of dead weight in our ranks . None of this should bother you ; more men have died at your'hands in Endpath than at mine here in '

81567	81736	81737	81737	You	2467	' The old man began to frown , and Alldera thought , he is going to make the wrong answer . Now she knew why she had spoken so freely to Bek in the camper , more freely than she had ever intended . Bek knew how to pay attention , however imperfectly and intermittently . It was to this offer of ultimate respect that Alldera had responded . But the idea of looking straight at a thing — or a person — to see what it was , rather than what use it might be to him , was alien to Maggomas . Schooled by years of examining the past for whatever he could turn to his own purposes , he had no conception of disinterested regard . Utility , bald and degrading , was his reality . His answer must be disastrous . Looking from the blind old man to the desperate son , she felt a shiver of sweet dread . Impatiently , Maggomas said , '

81886	81969	81883	81883	I	0	're further apart than I 'd thought . Maybe I was wrong about the maturing influence of Endpath . You would have no future if I had n't risked my soul to plant yours in the black pit of a fem 's belly ; if I had n't used my influence to keep certain Seniors from having you killed at once in the Boyhouse ; and if I had n't saved you from the consequences of your own foolish behavior later on .

82003	82023	81883	81883	I	0	' There are more unpaid debts than I think you know . Do you remember Karz Kambl at all ? '

82033	82120	82029	82029	Maggomas	278	' A good friend , but an incompetent engineer . I never meant to bring him upriver . In return for posting you to Endpath , the Board insisted that I leave the City immediately - and there was no one else I could call on for help at the time . That Karz ended up back in the City in spite of having blown himself up with my boat 's engine simply justified my original judgment that he was the wrong man for the job . '

82180	82324	82130	82130	Bek	183	' I 've thought of him often . He would have been miserable up here . He was too Destination 201 idealistic , impressionable , literal - minded in an innocent and vulnerable sort of way . I doubt he would have understood one single thing I 've had to do here in Troi t- any more than you do , I suspect . Now look here , boy ; this is no game where we outpoint each other for standings . I am the first real and true genius in generations to be born into this ass - end scrapheap of a world and to grow up with his brains unscrambled . The most has got to be made of my talents .

It was an incredible affair , and my people reacted as you might expect . By the time I got control again there was n't a fem left alive in the town . Even my lab population had been shot down in their cages , and all the mining - fems were destroyed . Not that it 's a disaster . When the City men realize their situation , they 'll be happy to trade anything they have for a packet of lammins , including their fems . '

A foolish waste ; there 's no reason why , with careful selective breeding over time , we should n't be able to obtain some very useful throwback strains . I foresee , for instance , a breed large enough and strong enough to bear a mounted man at a good pace - but too stupid to be dangerous . I had one very promising line started in the laboratory : two cubs with strong , hairy hides that might have been bred back to true fur - bearing form , given a few generations . '

83978	84066	83971	83971	you	2511	' Servan exclaimed . He was enthralled with all this , excited as a boy . The fem sat composed and motionless , her head tensely lowered so that Bek could n't see her expression . He studied the top of her head , willing her to look up at him . She must see that he repudiated all this . She must . His eyes burned with the effort to stare her into obedience to his mental urgency , as if he suddenly believed in witchery . '

Two small City patrols were quartering the lower reaches of the valley for stray Troimen . The rest of the invaders were gathered on the docks , quarreling with one another as they stowed their meager loot in the barges . The dead lay pale and tumbled along the palisade ; they had already been stripped of everything worth taking . Alldera , watching , sat on a hip - pack she had stolen on her way out of the town and stuffed with provender salvaged from the kitchen of a deserted dormitory . She chewed a plug of lammin .

The water was shallow here , and something had crossed to the far side ; no , two things — two strings of tracks separated and came together again . She had not seen a living being in the months since her escape from her homeland , nor had she expected to — other than perhaps the monsters with which legend peopled the wild country , but she had not really believed in them . She looked fearfully back over her shoulder . There rose the valley wall and then the mountains , beyond which lay the strip of coastal plain men called the Holdfast - her country . In the bloody confusion of fighting there — men killing other men and their femmish slaves , over food - she had made her lone escape . It seemed she was alone no longer . No man of the Holdfast , no fem fleeing as she fled , had made this spoor . Trembling , she traced the shape of the deep prints with her finger . Something heavy walked on those round , blunted feet . The marks were crescent - shaped and as big as her fist , with a sharp angle sign in the middle of each . Monsters '

Here was their excrement heaped on the ground like pungent dumplings — even shit reminded her of food , and rightly : without provisions she would die this winter . There was no choice but to follow and try to find the monsters , persuade them to help her . One way or another , it would end in food : they would either feed her or eat her . She spent a day following their tracks . She lost their trail , cast in circles for it , terrified of simply walking into them around some roll 228 Motherlines of the land . She kept stopping to catch her breath and to peer ahead as the day waned . She had to cross the river after them at the shallow place where they had crossed . Something red caught her eye . In surroundings which provided little now but greens , browns and the black of shadows , it was stunning , not some sly earth tone passing for red but a brash flare of scarlet . She crept closer . The red was a rag knotted around the end of some sort of bundle that was wedged into the crotch of a tree . With a stick she poked the bundle down ; it was a large bag made of some supple fabric , closed with a drawstring that ran through the stitched and puckered hem . She loosened the drawstring with difficulty . She was afraid to put her hand inside . Cautiously she raised the heavy end of the bag and eased some of its contents onto the ground : there were dark , hard lumps the size of her hand , a bundle of long , flat dried things strung together , and some smaller bags . One of the latter contained pine nuts like those she had gathered for herself from trees on the middle slopes of the mountains . The sight of the small , smooth shells spilling out onto her palm and the smell of resin on them made the unbelievable real : she had found some sort of food cache . She sat chewing and crying , fighting to keep from bolting so much that she would vomit it up again . She slept on the spot , hugging the bag with both arms . The next day , carrying some of the food with her , she continued westward on the monsters '

This desert was a seemingly limitless stretch of dark earth , all rucked up into long rows one after the other as if the fingers of a giant hand had been drawn parallel through loose dirt . Lonely hills rose sheer - sided to dilapidated peaks , windtorn , undercut , sometimes topped with a clutch of stunted trees . Swatches of green marked isolated groves . Puffs and veils of dust rising on the breeze were all that moved . The trail of the monsters led off the rim of the valley and angled down into the first trough of the desert . There the prints were lost in Prologue 229 a drift of dust . Alldera dared not try to follow them . She retreated , and made a bed of branches where she had found the supplies . They had left food ; they would come back . The nights grew cold as the moon turned through its cycle . There was no rain , the streams shrank . Her belly was bigger , she could not get around so easily ; she was hungry all the time . A sun - warmed rock some distance from her sleeping place became her station ; it was easier to withstand the urge to nibble more than her day 's ration if she removed herself from the food during the long , idle hours . She watched to the west for signs of the monsters '

The borderlands were disfigured by the stumps of the trees they cut , the pits they dug and left heaped all around with cast - up earth , the scattered charcoal of the huge and dangerous fires they lit to ease their fears of the dark . They did not even bother to cover their ordure . Sheel patted her pony 's shoulder and reined in at the foot of a slope . Dismounting , she loosened her saddle girth and tied her reins to the branch of a gnarled pine . Then , with a full quiver slung over her shoulder and her bow in her hand , she padded to the top of the ridge and lay down there to scan the wide , rippling country , breathing with pleasure its warm odors . The sun burned on her leatherclad back and legs and on her leather cap . Those rocks down below resembled the rocks in which she had buried her first kill . She had flayed the dead man 's arm to see what made his muscles bulge so unnaturally , and had come away dirty with his blood but no wiser . His sexual organs had seemed a ludicrous , dangling nuisance and hardly capable of the brutalities recounted by escaped femmish slaves . Having everything external and crowded into the groin like that must make walking more uncomfortable for a man than riding at the gallop with unsupported , milk - full breasts would be for a plains woman . A stud horse was better designed : a sheath held whatever penile length was not stored coiled within his body . What a perversity — a creature that would own her if she let it , yet it had nothing to boast of but a coarse strength that was still less than the power of one worn - out old pack mare . Men 's only good feature was that they were a peerlessly clever and dangerous quarry to hunt . Their terror at the end , when you came up and waited a little way off for the dying to be done with , was wide - eyed and bestial . Movement caught Sheel 's eye , there on a hillside she had already passed . It was her two companions , following after her . She did not Prologue 231 want them to catch up with her yet . She ran back down the slope , tugged her girth tight , caught up her reins and mounted to ride on ahead . Alldera thought about her cub . It took many days '

The lacing of the entry was suddenly pulled loose , admitting a rush of cool air . Two women entered , stooping , and walked to the center where the others rose to meet them . Even at its highest point the curved tent roof brushed the raincloud hair of Nenisi Conor , who was tall , angular and dark like a woman 's shadow on the ground in late afternoon . One of the black - skinned Conor line and imbued with the Conor trait of justice giving , she was a perfect speaker for the camp , unimpeachable .

She turned away to hide the horror of her feelings : the dark surge of grief for her lost people was shot through with the joy of being truly free of them at last . At first she reveled at the sight of female people running their own lives without so much as a scent of men about them ; even the several very pregnant women seemed sturdy and capable and utterly unworried by their vulnerable condition . Her jubilation receded as the hot , dry weeks wore on . She was invaded by weariness , depressed for days at a time by her undeserved survival into freedom and by the conviction that she would never learn to manage all the newness surrounding her . Loneliness assailed her . She longed sometimes to caress Shayeen 's glowing skin , and often caught herself staring at the sculpted beauty of Nenisi 's long dark face . The conviction of her own unworthiness turned her desires back on herself . She did not dare approach these women , except in her dreams . The blazing afternoon skies began to fill with clouds each day now , and the women stood outside watching in the heat . Four dry months almost behind them , they said ; four rainy months coming , then four cool months after that , making up the year . The Dusty Season was about to end . One afternoon it rained not at the camp but a distance to the south . Alldera could see the clouds trailing sweeps of rain past the horizon . The camp sprang into motion , shaking her sharply out of her lethargy . In a riot of shouting and laughter the women brought all thirty tents of Stone Dancing Camp down in the middle of the day . Alldera stood aside with the cub slung warm against her back , and she watched Holdfaster Tent reduced swiftly to leather and rope , all stowed away in capacious saddle packs . The tent poles were hitched in bundles alongside the flanks of a brown horse , the butt ends trailing on the ground . Every tent was similarly transformed into a dozen laden pack ponies . Everywhere were horses , their noise , their smell , their bulky powerful bodies moving in the dust they raised . One round - bellied The Women 253 animal exploded twice out of the hands of its packer and was rapidly reloaded each time . Alldera was terrified of being trampled or kicked by a horse that she would not see until too late . She watched Shayeen , covered in dust , first tugging a cinch strap with both hands , then slugging the pony in the flank with her fist so that it gasped out its deeply held breath and the buckle on the cinch could be closed . To Alldera 's immense relief no one suggested putting her on top of a horse . She half lay , half sat on a sled of heavy leather slung between the tent poles out of reach of the brown horse 's heels . Cub in lap , she rode the jouncing progress of the pole - butts . The brown horse , urged on by Nenisi on a spotted mount , led a string of others from the emptying campground . Around Alldera groups of horses plodded in the charge of other mounted figures . She saw the childpack darting among them and heard the children 's shrieks of excitement . The whole crowd of mounted women and pack horses descended from the low ridge on which they had been camped . As they poured down onto the salt flat below , the group shook itself into a crowd of mixed riders and pack animals surrounded by a wide ring of scouts . Within this circle of outriders the childpack ranged freely . Alldera recalled something Nenisi had told her of another creature of the plains , one Alldera had not yet seen : a low running beast furred in all the colors of the plains . The women hunted these '
101758	101890	101032	101032	I	0	' and wore their skins and ornaments made of their curved claws and teeth . The sharu ate anything , from grass and seeds to meat . That was why the childpack , which wandered at will all day , slept every night within the perimeter of the camp . She guessed that that was also why they ranged today inside the ring of scouts . This gave her a very secure feeling . She knew herself to be something of a child herself here , carried along while everyone else rode . Discomfited by the idea of Sheel seeing her in just that way , she asked where the rest of the family was . Nenisi pointed across the moving crowd at one of the scouts on the far side : '
101895	101919	101893	101893	Sheel	288	' Then she waved in the direction of the long , low curtain of dust drifting ahead of them well to the left . '
101929	101960	101920	101921	The others	5108	' Pass our daughter up here to me - the air is fresher , and the 254 Motherlines sooner she gets the feel of a horse 's back the better . '
102081	102089	102090	102090	she	290	' Everyone 's in such good spirits , '
102115	102119	102120	102120	Nenisi	297	' Of course , '
102123	102144	102120	102120	Nenisi	297	' the rain frees us from our wells , you see . Now we can freely travel our country again . '
102360	102792	102340	102340	She	305	' camps . She relaxed into the pleasure of being enfolded in the enormous spaces of the sky and the land , for already this crew were on their way back to the tea camp in the foothills . Their trade journey over the plains was nearly ended , and she was sorry . She loved it out here . She loved to be one of the many points of living warmth that peopled the vast darkness over the Grasslands . She loved the grit of the soil under her thighs and palms , the glimmer of firelight on the yellow stubble beyond the edges of the camp , the evening stir of air as the day 's heat drifted starward . She felt her thoughts flowing out over the tableland . She pictured horses dozing or listening with upswung heads for a rustle in the grass ; and the wide - flung camps of the Mares , groups of broad - winged tents herding loosely together in drowsy silence ; and the hungry sharu sleeping in their networks of burrows ; and of course all the free fems , radiating outward crew by crew across the great expanse from 256 Motherlines one Marish camp to another . She loved this life at least as much as she loved life in the tea camp in the hills . Of course there were risks , difficulties , irritations in living anywhere . Daya had been a pet , bred for the pleasure of men 's eyes as well as other pleasures . Despite the scars that marred her beauty now , she was still young , small and slender enough to be attractive even when she had no wish to attract . She did not enjoy being fought over by other free fems , so she took pains to acquire a companion like Kenoma whose truculence discouraged ardor in others . But jealousy inclined Kenoma to turn her banked violence on Daya at the smallest provocation . Right now by the fire Daya could feel the tension in Kenoma 's thigh drawing tighter , promising release in a scene , perhaps a thrashing , later on . Kenoma was only safe for a short while longer ; the risks of staying at her side were beginning to outweigh the advantages of her companionship . Daya did not want to worry about that now . She held the sweetness of the brush smoke deep in the chambers of her nostrils . She felt Kenoma stir and tauten , and heard her say harshly , '
102817	102834	102813	102813	She	3055	' How annoying , how foolish , Daya thought . What does it mean even to say '
102836	102890	102340	102340	She	305	' ? Time was different here . Life did not rush from crisis to crisis and turn instantly into some new and dangerous course at a master 's whim , as it had in the Holdfast . There were different rhythms in the Grasslands , long and slow and repetitive . Nothing came in '
102892	102894	102813	102813	She	3055	' and '
102896	102901	102340	102340	She	305	' here , but as '
102903	102905	102813	102813	She	3055	' or '
102907	102976	102340	102340	She	305	' . The Grasslands was like a great disc of earth revolving endlessly under the great disc of sky and season . They should not talk of a new fem as if she were unique , as if she were capable of making a difference to the wide wheeling patterns of these plains . Yet this new fem 's long stay with the Mares had touched the free fems '
102979	102994	102340	102340	She	305	' Maybe she brings a message the Mares do n't want us to have . '
102995	103019	102813	102813	She	3055	' Maybe the men are preparing an invasion , and the Mares are keeping her with them to get information out of her . '
103020	103035	103037	103037	her	3056	' No , it 's the Mares that are preparing an invasion , so they 're
103044	103182	103037	103037	her	3056	' Daya was handed a bowl of beer to drink and she let her fingers slip along the hand of the giver . Kenoma noticed , slapped the bowl The Women 257 out of her hand , and kicked the other fem so that she nearly fell into the fire . Sandaled feet scattered the coals as fems jumped up , cursing , ready for a fight but amused too ; Daya was famous for her amours and the problems they brought her . She dodged and evaded Kenoma 's angry blows , and seeing that the big fem had taken off her sandals earlier to ease her feet , managed to draw her to the scattered fire . Everyone roared with laughter to see Kenoma bellowing and hopping on first one foot and then the other . '
103186	103207	103037	103037	her	3056	' Daya cried , holding up her hands in mock terror as Kenoma , limping , closed in on her . '
103242	103319	103240	103240	Kenoma	306	' Daya was a favorite storyteller among the free fems , and it made no difference that they all knew the story she proposed to tell . This crew had all been labor fems of one sort or another in the Holdfast , regarding pets like Daya as pampered traitors . They loved any tale told and retold of the haughty brought low . Under their urging , Kenoma 's fury gave way to sullen acquiescence . '
103324	103328	103240	103240	Kenoma	306	' Daya began , '
103352	103463	103464	103464	He	3062	' She sprang up , she paraded before them , moving in the sinuous , exaggerated style of a highly trained pet fem . Languorously she blinked at them as if they were men come to buy . She told the drama of the bidding to be her master and of how a man of the blues named Kazzaro had bought her . She imitated her master Kazzaro 's high - shouldered , nervous posture and showed them how he fretted about his clothing and patted his spreading bald spot . He had been clean , decent - looking , and relatively rich , and she had counted herself fortunate . '
103577	103682	103683	103683	I	0	' She told of his house , the magnificence of the tiled walls , the 258 Motherlines floors cushioned in thick carpets of heavy hemp dyed vibrant blues and greens . Enthralled , nodding , murmuring , the free fems drank in details of carved wooden shutters , painted roof beams , rich glazes and luxurious pillows , sweet scents wafting on the warm air . The more she embellished , the better they liked it . She added a tinkling mobile of metal chips , and a display of Kazzaro 's prize collection of small ceramic figures used in the game of Tail . '
103737	103760	103761	103761	He	3070	' But how my heart thundered , how I longed to be alone so that I could touch all those luxurious things ! '
103791	103811	103776	103778	another pet fem	3074	' Daya let her fingers crook into claws and curled her lips back from her teeth in a snarl . '
103830	103859	103860	103860	She	3078	' I thought , I can hold my own here . The other fem was not young , and her beauty - clearly wonderful once — had faded . '
104058	104238	104241	104241	Merika	310	' I was young , sure of myself , and credulous . Did I realize how it affected the aging pet when our master noted the pleasure of his The Women 259 guests when he lent me to them in Merika 's place ? On the other hand , it pleased her that I replaced her monthly in the breeding rooms . Kazzaro could not bear to send her there . Did I see the satisfaction on her face when I was swollen with pregnancy ? Did I understand why she kept plying me with the richest titbits of her own food , I who was as slim as a boy and so doubly fetching to our master ? He was a man , after all , with a man 's natural interest in his own sex and a proper male lover named Charkin . In me he could have male and female beauty both at once , while Merika grew softer and rounder and plumper all the time , for want of exercise and because of her age . '
104257	104262	104263	104263	Daya	305	' You all know , '
104271	104288	104263	104263	Daya	305	' the treachery of pet fems toward each other . Hear now how Merika treated me ! '
104597	104667	104668	104670	The free fems	1978	' He let out a roar , Merika shrieked and bolted , and I was left standing there too startled to move . Charkin snatched up a broiling spit that he 'd just eaten clean . He lunged and drove it through my face from one side to the other ! I felt it tear my cheeks and smash two teeth , and my mouth filled up with blood . '
104766	104865	104755	104755	They	3105	' To my surprise , I liked it in the kitchens . It was always warm , and there was n't anything like the rivalry I 'd seen in the pet quarters . The men overseeing the kitchens were young , and the older men kept them hungry . What we fems did did n't matter as long as we were n't caught stealing food . The overseers themselves stole food all the time , but we were better thieves than they were . I enjoyed learning to cook , too , for it 's a great art . '
104878	105037	104868	104868	you	3108	' She spoke of how certain kitchen fems had maneuvered to get her into difficulties with their boss fem by making Daya look like a troublemaker . Any time fems fought out their private quarrels , Daya 's enemies said her flirting had provoked the fighting . The boss fem could not afford to have a demoted pet fem full of spite making problems in her crew , or all would suffer . So she got Daya slated for transfer to the brickyards . Faced with having to try to fit herself in among yet another set of labor fems there , Daya preferred the risks of the Wild . It was at that point that she had made her run for the border — another story . She never pointed out that here among the free fems of the Grasslands she found herself once more a pet among labor fems . She kept that joke to herself . '
105048	105052	105053	105053	She	3111	' Kenoma sneered . '
105058	105072	105053	105053	She	3111	' The Women 261 Daya raked the scattered coals together with a stick . '
105114	105120	105121	105121	She	3111	' Kenoma snorted with disbelief . '
105138	105198	105121	105121	She	3111	' No one wanted to follow that up . Now that the appetite for drama was sated , their mood drifted into reminiscence . One older fem , who was picking up glowing fragments of the fire in her calloused fingers and tossing them back into the hot center of the flames , shook her head and said softly , '
105241	105246	105237	105239	our fine cook	3121	' Daya nodded graciously . '
105262	105268	105253	105253	we	3120	' the old fem continued , '
105285	105543	105253	105253	we	3120	' Daya leaned back against the tall wheel of the wagon , listening , secure for the evening . 5 Alldera sat knotting the dry fibres spread on her knee into a menstrual plug . She could not yet turn out dozens of them during a conversation without looking down at her work , as the women did ; but she could make enough for her own needs . There was no water to spare during the dry , dusty weather to wash out a fem - style bleeding rag . She looked up now and again at Sheel , who nursed the cub and helped Nenisi cook — so strange to see that soft round cub head against Sheel 's conical breast . The two sharemothers talked as women talked whenever there was time : of horses , water , grass and weather , but most often of their kindred . Alldera loved to listen and took pride in being able to follow more and more all the time . Tangled skeins of events were unrolled , like the history which pitted a wealthy cousin of Shayeen in what seemed eternal enmity against someone of the Faller tent . This naturally involved Sheel because of a sister of hers who was a sharemother in that tent . Dozens of women were mixed up in the quarrel , including women of other camps . Shayeen had her enemies , Nenisi had hers , and Sheel had many . Even Barvaran was entangled in some huge row of years '
105861	105863	105844	105844	Nenisi	297	' Motherlines '
105979	106007	105968	105968	Nenisi	297	' This is the child of my sister , cousin Marisu Conor from Windgrass Camp ; and this is Jesselee Morrowtrow , one of Sheel 's mothers . '
106031	106035	106022	106022	Sheel	288	' Heart - mother '
106052	106064	106065	106065	Sheel	288	' At the last Gather when I asked where you were , '
106071	106110	106065	106065	Sheel	288	' they told me that a horse had kicked you while you were doctoring her . I thought it would be healed up by now . Live 264 Motherlines around horses , you 'll limp half your life . '
106111	106119	106120	106122	the old woman	3158	' Do n't believe everything you hear , '
106125	106131	106120	106122	the old woman	3158	' A crocodile bit me . '
106132	106140	106141	106141	Alldera	290	' Nenisi , what 's a crocodile ? '
106180	106184	106185	106185	Nenisi	297	' A joke , '
106188	106212	106185	106185	Nenisi	297	' though they do say such Ancient creatures still live , far to the south where the plain turns to forest and marsh . '
106213	106217	106218	106218	Sheel	3162	' A crocodile ! '
106221	106253	106218	106218	Sheel	3162	' Like the one whose skin you showed me once when I was little — only that turned out to be a sheet of bark stripped from a fresh tent pole . '
106259	106315	106256	106256	Jesselee	315	' There I was , prowling the shoreline marshes by the Salty River . I 'd dreamed of one of the drowned cities of the Ancients , and I thought that meant that some treasure would be washed up for me . Instead here comes this knobby dark form , floating silently nearer and nearer - '
106316	106323	106325	106326	Marisu Conor	314	' And it gobbled you up , '
106518	106560	106561	106561	She	315	' I used to play , as a child , that I was an invader from over the river or else a gallant defender of our camp . I did n't know in those days who the real intruder would be . '
106593	106595	106582	106582	Alldera	290	' I 'm
106612	106617	106618	106618	Jesselee	315	' tales by now . '
106627	106629	106605	106605	I	0	' I 'm
106665	107267	106605	106605	I	0	' Sheel bit her lip but said nothing , and Alldera felt filled with victory . First you made sure that the long Rainy Season dampness had not made the tea moldy . Then you shaved it fine . Alldera had only been given the job of making the midday tea once before , and she had used water that was too hot and had had to sit by and watch the family members gulp down the bitter stuff anyway , because tea was too valuable to be wasted . She leaned over her work , sat back again to shake the hair out of her eyes . Over the months her hair had grown out long and as healthy as it ever got , and she was always meaning to cut it shoulder length , the women 's favorite style , and never getting around to it . Unintentionally she caught the eye of a woman who was walking past , one arm slung companionably over the withers of a spotted mare that ambled beside her like a friend . The woman smiled . Alldera did not recognize her , but smiled timidly in return , and bent to her work again . Concentrating on the tea making was hard . Behind her Barvaran and Shayeen were chatting together about childhood . Shayeen , seeding peppers for the array of kettles in front of her , complained intermittently about the stinging of her fingers . She had piles of fresh - picked peppers still to cut , for it was the Holdfaster Tent 's turn to lay out food for the childpack today . The children knew it and were gathered nearby , giggling and fighting around the edges of a huge puddle on the margins of which their feet slid and splashed . They pushed each other into it . A few of them squatted down to imitate the adults over make - believe fires of piled stones . Barvaran kept an eye on them , stopping her conversation to shout warnings at them now and then . She was simmering milk and laying out the squeezed dregs from the pots in lumps to dry on the tent fly . The children were notorious thieves of whatever food they found 266 Motherlines lying around , perhaps because they were never punished . Alldera braced the tea brick on her knee , watching a shaving curl away from her knife blade . The scent of cooking milk was making her mouth water . She had developed an inordinate fondness for the fragile plates of fresh cream cake that could be lifted from the surface of a cooled pan of simmered milk . The milking of mares in foal took much of everyone 's time , and the whole camp lived on fresh milk these days . Alldera could not pick up the trick of seizing the small , waxy teat way up under a mare 's leg , so she felt guilty about her appetite for the pale , sweet food . Now : start with the cold water to moisten the shavings or it comes out too bitter . Enough cold , she hoped ; then water from the hot kettle , but slowly , not too much , cold again right away so that not all the powerful taste would be leached out in the first steeping . That seemed good ; the rising scent was mild and minty . Barvaran was speaking with affectionate humor of a pack game that hinged on guessing whether a child who was '
107269	107490	107491	107491	You	3178	' had a finger in her nose or not by just listening to her talk in the dark . It was weird even now to think of these women as having once lived the life of the childpack and to think of the cub of Holdfaster Tent joining that life . She was growing fast . Alldera remembered how the leather sling had sagged against Nenisi 's back this morning when the black woman had ridden out to the milking lines carrying the cub with her . Barvaran and Shayeen talked of a wild dancing game played with the horses , of sleepy sex games , and — in a subdued manner — about harrying the unfit from the pack . Many died in their first pack year . When the children brought in one of their number who was ill to be tended by the adults , that child was generally discovered to have exceptional qualities . With a rush of confidence Alldera decided to take the next step : the mixing of flour and water to make noodles , which the women put in their tea along with milk and salt , making it into a meal . She hoped no one would insist on helping . They were too deep in talk . Shayeen was saying wistfully , '
107567	107568	107545	107545	they	3182	' '
107580	107584	107577	107577	I	0	' Barvaran agreed . '
107644	107645	107619	107619	Somebody	649	' '
107655	107659	107619	107619	Somebody	649	' Shayeen said . '
107686	107687	107619	107619	Somebody	649	' '
107698	107886	107917	107917	Someone	646	' Sitting back , her work completed , Alldera suddenly noticed how cool the morning was once she was not bending over the heat of the tea fire . She tightened her breast wrap — by now she could adjust the knot behind her back by herself — and slipped her long leather shirt on over her head . She put on her headcloth and the rawhide crown that snugged it to her head , and stood up . The pants that Barvaran had lent her fit fairly well , closing at the waist with a drawstring ; but the legs had to be tugged down every once in a while because Alldera did not like to wear the soft boots that helped to anchor them . She had gone barefoot all her life . She sheathed her knife and buckled on her belt . The women wore the knife sheathed at the small of the back , where the tip could not catch the thigh upraised to mount a horse . Alldera stayed clear of the horses and wore her knife at her hip . The horses '
107970	107973	107974	107974	she	297	' Look , '
108195	108234	108235	108235	She	293	' Those are free fems , come to trade from their camp in the eastern hills . They 'll go right to the chief tent ; we have to get our trade goods together . You go ahead . '
108259	108301	108254	108254	Nenisi	297	' I have to ride out again . Alldera — if the free fems say anything that confuses you , I 'll try to explain it later . It would be best if you did n't mention your child to them . '
108866	109024	109033	109037	the long - faced one	3245	' wagon stood , outside the camp . Troubled,-she drew nearer . Femmish leaders had designed her escape so that she might bring back a pledge of aid from free fems . Now here were real free fems ; she felt off balance , flooded with guilt for her abandoned task . She walked the length of the wagon , touching the bleached and weathered wood of its lower walls ; it smelled of dust and tea and sweat . Suddenly it rocked under her hand . Someone jumped down from inside and looked around the end wall at her , then leaned back to speak tensely to a hidden companion . Another face appeared . That 's no woman , that 's a fem - look at the butt and legs on her , sprinter 's muscle . You know these wild people never walk if they 270 Motherlines can ride , let alone run anywhere . '
109025	109031	109033	109037	the long - faced one	3245	' Then it 's her , '
109039	109044	109046	109047	the other	537	' She 's young , '
109062	109078	109046	109047	the other	537	' Hey , do n't they keep watch on you ? Where 's your guard ? '
109079	109085	109086	109086	Alldera	290	' I have no guard . '
109102	109106	109095	109096	The two	3247	' You mean you 're
109119	109138	109117	109117	fem	2125	' It was too late to pretend that they were wrong , that she was a Riding Woman . '
109146	109150	109139	109140	No one	5106	' Alldera said . '
109158	109195	109151	109151	I	0	' She realized that it would be a mistake to tell them she had not learned of their existence until today . She could picture their sneers at that , their knowing glances . One said , '

109337	109374	109379	109379	they	3258	' The black - haired one closed in on her . Alldera glanced around for help , a witness , anything . She heard the long - faced fem say low - voiced to the other , '
109390	109450	109451	109451	You	3260	' Too late , Alldera bolted . They sprang after her . A spear shaft thrust between her legs brought her down with a racking pain in her shin . She could not help it , she lay and hugged her leg , and they dropped their weapons and took hold of her , lifting her toward the wagon . '
109461	109469	109451	109451	You	3260	' the black - haired fem growled . '

109513	109536	109507	109507	You	3264	' Alldera cried through tears of pain , as if in a nightmare that they meant to take her to their master . '
109541	109559	109560	109561	Mare lover	3265	' A hard hand clamped over her mouth , cupped to avoid her The Women 271 teeth . '
109563	109676	109560	109561	Mare lover	3265	' spat one of the fems . As they wrestled her back against the tail of the wagon , trying to heave her inside , something jarred a cry from the one on her left . The other fem gasped and let go . Alldera twisted free . Sprawled on the ground , she heard the thump of blows , saw the frenetic figures of children leaping up from the tall grass to fling stones at the fems . She looked up at the black - haired fem 's angry face squinting at her from inside the wagon where the two of them had taken shelter . She heard the furious words : '
109725	109766	109768	109768	they	3270	' The wagon rattled and shook with the impact of the childpack 's missiles . The long - faced fem paused for breath . There was blood on her cheek and a bruise swelling where a stone had hit her . '
109781	109785	109768	109768	they	3270	' she cried . '
109803	110069	109768	109768	they	3270	' Alldera got up and ran . The childpack raced past her , touching , laughing , and vanished . Curled around her own misery and confusion , she lay in the tall grass on a rise outside the camp , watching from hiding until the free fems had packed up their goods and left . They moved the wagon out , pulling it in the midst of a ring of scouts like women moving camp . The scouts , on foot , did not go any great distance from the wagon , perhaps for fear of losing sight of one another behind a swell of ground . From the rise Alldera listened to the sounds of evening descending on Stone Dancing Camp . As women lit their tea fires , voices spoke and laughed . Riders came home from settling the horses on night pasture . Each sang a personal song that identified her to the woman who met her with a bowl of food and who took from her the mounts she had brought to be tethered in camp for the night . Alldera recognized Nenisi 's self - song . She saw Nenisi ride in and give something to Barvaran : a bundle in a leather sling . That was what she had gone to do , then : take the child further out of camp while the free fems were there . Alldera got up and limped down toward camp . Nenisi came out 272 Motherlines on foot to meet her . They stood beyond the outermost tents in the dusk . '
110082	110086	110075	110075	I	0	' Nenisi said . '
110100	110105	110106	110106	You	3271	' A wasteful blaze . '
110117	110125	110112	110112	they	3272	' How many are there like them ? '
110129	110150	110112	110112	they	3272	' Maybe half a hundred , all free fems found by us in the borderlands , as you were found . '
110158	110167	110112	110112	they	3272	' They said I was a prisoner here . '
110168	110253	110126	110126	Alldera	290	' Sit down with me , let 's talk . They themselves are the prisoners - not of us , but of the way things are . They say they wish to return to the Holdfast , invade it , save the fems there . They live in a camp of their own in the foothills and make preparations to go home . When they venture too far toward the Holdfast , our patrols turn them back . This makes them bitter against us . '
110334	110362	110363	110363	You	3280	' Alldera realized guiltily that she had accepted that desert , too , as she had accepted that the free fems were a myth . She said , '

110835	110895	110896	110896	They	3294	' Yes . The daughters got together and figured out how to use the men 's information machines . They found out all about the Wasting , the wars and famines and plagues going on outside , and how the lab could be made self - sustaining if things outside collapsed completely . They laid plans of their own . '
110973	110999	110965	110965	they	3294	' She paused . Alldera thought , giving me time to take it in , treating me like some stupid hulk of a free fem . '

111243	111297	111336	111336	Nenisi	297	' chances were poor . They bred slowly , and they were delicate from living so many generations with humans to take care of them .

111298	111311	111312	111312	Alldera	290	' And what did they do for themselves , these great witches , '
111315	111324	111312	111312	Alldera	290	' so that they could breed without men ? '
111325	111335	111336	111336	Nenisi	297	' Not witches , but dedicated and intelligent women , '
111343	111404	111336	111336	Nenisi	297	' They perfected the changes the labs had bred into them so that no men were needed .

111732	111744	111731	111731	You	0	're raising a free fem among you , that 's all . '
111745	111867	111731	111731	You	0	' No , we do n't think so . When you came to us , that child was still forming inside you . We made you sleep to rest and strengthen you both . We fed you the milk of our breasts and the food chewed in our mouths , the food of Motherlines that we feed our babies . We fed your child , through your blood while she was still in your womb . We think she 's become like our own children . We still feed her - that 's why we do all her nursing . You see how healthily she grows , how fast , just like other babies here . We do n't have our forebears '

111978	111983	111974	111976	the free fems	1978	' Nenisi answered quickly , '
112025	112077	112017	112017	you	3353	' Alldera could not explain without sounding selfish and ungrateful ; if she had known about the free fems sooner , she would have had a chance to consider the cub 's future as if there were choices to be made about it . The women had not kept the free fems '

112167	112248	112249	112249	Nenisi	297	' wagon was invisible . Their fire had gone out . It was true , she thought , their road came from destruction and led to destruction , and if she found herself fortunate enough to be on another path , why turn back ? She reminded herself of the prime lesson of a slave 's life : protect youself , be selfish . Next morning she put on her belt with the knife sheathed in back and she said , '
112258	112262	112252	112252	you	297	' Nenisi grinned . '
112271	112561	112252	112252	you	297	' Alldera , responsible today for raking out horse dung to dry into usable fuel , was late to the chief tent and had to sit outside with the overflow . They were debating not the usual personal complaints beyond the abilities of the families and Motherlines to settle , but a diplomatic matter : whether or not to accept the offer of some grazing rights from neighboring Red Sand Camp . Women feared that Red Sand would come around later — as they had done to another camp in the past - and say the grass had been a loan , and demand repayment . In such a discussion Nenisi Conor would surely speak . The tea bowl was handed round ; Alldera sipped and passed it on . Listening was thirsty work . Sometimes she thought the Shawdens were chiefs because they could afford to serve endless rounds of tea to half the camp day after day . It was certainly not because they took the lead in anything . The slow , oblique movement of debate was mesmerizing . She remembered the way the men - and fems , imitating men - had decided things , quickly , by command . Here , anyone with something to say could speak , which made for long hours of exhaustion or entertainment , depending on the interest of a given case . Their ease at speaking their minds still awed her . She sometimes spoke herself now , of grass and horses , over the evening tea fire ; she sought to share their free flow of conversation . She nibbled at a callus that had formed on her hand from the pressure of the rein . Many months '
112658	112710	112655	112655	She	297	' Sharu have ravaged our northern pasture . What will you do when you hear your horses wandering and calling in hunger at night in the Dusty Season ? Our friends and sisters and cousins , our daughters and mothers in the Red Camp say , take this gift of grass . '
112780	112863	112865	112865	she	3374	' There are new families in Red Sand since both those times . How many here have sisters and other close kin now in Red Sand Camp that did not have them there five years ago ; two years ago ; last year ? A woman is constant in her actions through her life according to her traits until at last she dies . But a camp changes all the time as its women come and go , and it lives forever . '

I could have mentioned today a time when Stone Dancing Camp women themselves behaved very badly toward a neighbor camp . Of course there was the excuse that we had n't yet recovered from one of the earth tremors that give this camp its name , but it 278 Motherlines was long before my time and no one really knows for certain what was in women 's minds . . . Anyway , bringing that up just would have caught everyone up in an old argument , and nothing would have been decided about Red Sand for days yet . '

113240	113332	113223	113223	you	3384	' As she cut the reeds she began singing her self - song , addressing the reeds as if identifying herself with them . You know me . In the Gather of the blind foal year I put eight arrows into the air , one behind the other , before the first fell to the ground . You know me . My mother Tesh Periken taught me to bite out a colt 's balls with my good front teeth . The horse scarcely swells , the wound never festers , but I 'm

I helped Tomassin Hont to cure the finest sharu hide she ever took , I put my scraper right through it , I was so much help . There was a lot more ; Alldera found herself laughing . '

113472	113479	113469	113470	anybody else	3390	' Nenisi handed her more reeds . '
113488	113515	113483	113483	her	3391	' Alldera looked over to where the grazing horses were visible , drifting against the skyline that ran forever , flat and broad . The Women 279 '

113615	113659	113561	113561	you	3388	' She pulled Alldera down on the sand beside her , pushed away the bundle of reeds , and , laughing , slipped her arm around Alldera 's neck . Alldera yielded uncertainly , was pressed to Nenisi 's sharp - boned side . '
113665	113669	113670	113670	We	3394	' Nenisi murmured . '
113671	113733	113561	113561	you	3388	're together , that 's all ; friends . No one is master of the other . We do what we like , and we stop when we like . No need to be shy about your scars — give me your hand . A sharu sliced my ribs once when I was being foolish , and feel this great ridge I 'm
113758	113772	113773	113773	You	3396	' Now when she laughed the sound was richer , roughened with excitement . '
113785	114354	113773	113773	You	3396	' They made love together . Alldera asked no questions . She had felt shut out from the women 's constant patting and clasping and stroking of one another ; at the same time their closeness had offended her . Now she wanted nothing to intrude on the joy of touching and being touched , freely and sensually . It was a triumph to feel Nenisi 's cabled body loosen and flow as she held it . Her own limbs slackened and trembled when Nemsi stroked her , seeking out the sensitive places that turned the light tickle of fingers in a deep , sinking sweetness almost too intense to be borne . That night she lay awake in Nenisi 's bedding , warm and drowsing , for a long time . As she snugged herself close against the smooth curve of Nenisi 's back , she thought of the Holdfast fems . There had been some moments of passionate contact , usually in a corner of the crowded room that served as night quarters for the members of her master 's femhold . She remembered tension , haste , the need for silence . The others would thump you in the head to keep you quiet so that they could get the sleep they needed for their next day 's work . . . bad dreams out of a hideous life , but rich with excitement and 280 Motherlines danger . She remembered a pretty fem , only recently demoted from pet status for some trifling error or other , the only really pretty partner Alldera had ever had . In the dark tangle of their embrace , this one had thrust an object into Alldera 's hand , begging her in a smothered voice to use it , to root in her body with it like a man . Alldera had tried to break the wooden phallus against the bars of the window . Others had pulled her down ; do n't let the little pervert upset you , they 'd said . That memory had no power to hurt her . She was a woman now . She pressed her cheek to the back of Nenisi 's neck , breathing in the faintly musky scent and feeling the giddy joy of her own liberty . In the Holdfast Alldera had been a messenger trained to run . She had not run in some three years now . That Cool Season she took it up again . It was hard . Months of riding had firmed up new muscles and slackened others . She ran with the horizon flowing past on one side and the tents of camp wheeling by on the other , and she thought of other runners she had known in the Holdfast ; like great Kanda of the long , thin legs who ran with a tireless , bounding stride , her hands flapping loosely at waist height as if she exerted herself no more than the wind does when it blows . Not thought of in all this time ; dead now , probably . Women came to look as Alldera ran , clearly not comprehending her devotion to this outlandish way of making herself sweaty and exhausted on her own two feet . Sometimes she pushed herself , happily showing off for them . 6 In time her gladness dimmed . '
114365	114399	113773	113773	You	3396	' Nenisi said one morning . Alldera said nothing . She had felt the safety and happiness of their closeness wearing away for some time , and had not known what to do . '
114407	114442	113773	113773	You	3396	' the black woman continued . The seed grasses are tall in the gullies . Leave your running for a while , and come grain gathering with me . We need some time alone . '
114576	114632	114573	114573	Nenisi	297	' Alldera , I want you to understand something about us here . It 's a sickness to fix on only one person 282 Motherlines and keep everyone else out . It 's as if to say , only I and my lover are true women , the rest of you are false and worthless . '
114633	114642	114573	114573	Nenisi	297	' You think it 's sick , but - '
114643	114679	114573	114573	Nenisi	297	' Listen . You should find some other women to love , too . Do you want me to wear myself to nothing , trying to be all the women in the camp to you ? '
114680	114692	114573	114573	Nenisi	297	' I do n't want all the women in the camp . '
114703	114747	114748	114748	She	2920	' You will have to learn , but not from me . For us two to talk about this will only lead to quarreling . But I will show you how we think of love so you can see it , all right ? '
114781	114819	114765	114765	her	2920	' Look , here is womanness . Why should we separate from each other two by two ? What makes it right for two to be alone , when it 's not right for one to be ? '
114886	114895	114896	114896	Alldera	290	' It 's different where I come from , '
115023	115045	115019	115019	Nenisi	297	' No , that 's not the idea at all . That song is all about fems , not about yourself . '
115046	115054	115055	115055	Alldera	290	' I was trying to please you , '
115099	115128	115076	115076	they	5067	' shoulders . One afternoon Alldera spoke of the fems of the Holdfast , harvesting hemp plants under the whips of the overseers . Again Nenisi interrupted her : '

115483	115488	115473	115473	Alldera	290	' Sometimes they do . '
115489	115529	115530	115530	Nenisi	297	' You could have someone stay here to keep them off . And then you 'd have seeds enough to plant — there 's plenty of water on the ground in the Rainy Season — and grow more grain . '
115541	115599	115533	115533	her	297	' More for what ? We gather enough seed heads for the horses and for our flour . If we had more — well , there 'd soon be too many horses to feed and care for and milk . Women are n't slaves to tend the earth . We just live here as best we can . '
115602	115618	115533	115533	her	297	' It 's stupid to do things this way when there 's a better way . '
115619	115628	115629	115629	Nenisi	297	' Make your suggestion at the chief tent , '

When they got back to Stone Dancing she found that something important had happened in their absence . Every year the women held a Gather of all the camps . When pressed , Barvaran said it was a sort of social meeting , with games and political arrangements about horses , grass and water , and so on . Alldera had gone through her first Gather all unknowing in healing sleep , and last year only a few families from Stone Dancing had attended , for some reason too complicated and obscure for Alldera to unravel .

Behind one of the groups the stolen horses were being held by two riders . Someone dashed out into the open space between the two lines of women . Alldera , galloping down a long roll of grassy ground , heard the voices shrilling high and the whickering of horses . The lone rider curvetted her mount there in the open , standing in her stirrups to yell at the smaller group , the raiders . She rode up and down between the two ranks , she flung down her knife and threw out her arms , shaking her fists . Shouts , whistles , some movement among the White Wind women . The rider leaned down and scooped up her weapon and rode back to her own line . Alldera thought of her bow , but the range was too great for her from a horse 's back . Someone had seen her , rode hard to meet her - Nenisi , her dark skin smeared with dirt and sweat . Pulling up beside Alldera in a flurry of dust she cried , '

If the wind shifted , the camp itself would be in danger . Even if not , vital ranges of grass would be burned . She helped Nenisi to drag out all the tent 's bedding , ride to the rock pool the camp was using for water , and throw everything in . Other women were doing the same , jumping from their horses '

122532	122857	122520	122520	you	297	' FREE FEMS 7 Daya loved the sweeping yellow plain . Yet she always enjoyed returning to the tea camp in the foothills . The space and silence of the open country was pleasing only up to a point , for she had lived her whole life among other fems , first in the kit pits and later in her master 's populous femhold . Conversation , lively companions and the pleasing tension of intrigue made up her natural surroundings . Her periodic excursions with the trade wagons were passages in a special dream life of loneliness and survival amid elemental forces . Today the tang of wet weather was in the air , and clouds stood on one another 's shoulders obscuring the mountains . She looked forward to the comforts of the tea camp and to seeing Elnoa again . She would be warm with Elnoa , and generous . She could always extend herself to her conquests . The wagon she walked beside was a sturdy openwork structure of wicker and light wood pulled by a crew of twelve fems . They did not sing as they leaned into the ropes and straps of the harness . They had sung at work as slaves in the Holdfast , and they were free people now . Daya missed the old music . In the quiet of her own mind she sang a load - carrying song as she walked looking for seasoning plants for the stew pot . See how the muscles run in our arms , See how the strength swings in our stride . What is the weight that we could not carry ? 302 Motherlines Where is the riverboat we could not haul ? Mother Moon , send us a task fit for our power . Not that Daya herself had ever been a labor fem . She was too small and slight . But she remembered the labor gangs '
122883	123442	122882	122882	fems	5172	' faces lighting with relief to see her , for there lay Elnoa prostrate on the edge of death — losing weight — insisting that to none but Daya would she reveal the hiding place where she hoarded her treasure of precious objects , to none but Daya would she relinquish her great leather account books . . . The first free fems to settle here had grouped their wagons under the trees by the spring that flowed down the heart of the narrow valley . The abandoned hulk of an old wagon marked the spot , a trysting place Daya had often used . By Elnoa 's time the camp had been moved to an elevation backed by the southern hills , overlooking the spring and much of the valley . Signs of an effort to build walls of fired mud brick on the hill remained . Daya had heard a tale that the move and the attempt at fortification had been a response to a period of especially tense relations with the Mares . Elnoa had entrenched the free fems in their higher location . Under her direction they had begun to park their wagons to form a hollow square and to mount a patrol of sentries on the perimeter . Broken - down and tenantless wagons , now used for storage , were interspersed with occupied ones . The spaces between them and the gaps left by wagons gone out trading were filled with temporary walls of rock and brush . This patchwork parapet enclosed a wide , bare yard in which the free fems lived and worked , either in the open or under awnings stretched from the wagon roofs to poles planted in the dirt . There were no trees . Elnoa 's own huge vehicle , holding the center of the yard , dominated everything . On a wet day like this the place looked dead , and Daya quailed a little at the sight of it . What have I come back to ? she wondered . Awnings of oiled leather were stretched over racks of smoking tea , some stacked tea bricks , and a pile of raw leaf . The heavy weaving looms were similarly sheltered , looking like big - boned creatures Free Fems 303 standing gloomily together out of the wet . While the crew pulled aside a mound of brush to let their wagon through , Kobba , the crew boss , entered the muddy , deserted yard . She paced about heedless of the rain . Daya had noticed that no sentries were walking the perimeter or the skyline above and behind the camp . She knew Kobba would have grim interviews with those she had left on guard . Some would soon sport black eyes and swollen lips . There were always fems foolish enough to ask Kobba what there was to watch for . The Mares patrolled the borderlands to the east , so the men of the Holdfast could never spring a surprise attack . Kobba always said she was not interested in what the Mares did , she was interested in what the fems did , particularly about their own security . Swiftly the crew parked the trade wagon , checked the lashings of its cover , and climbed into their friends '

Following tradition , the master had ordered Elnoa 's tongue removed to impress upon her that she was responsible for the silent submissiveness of those she bossed . '
124358	124396	124397	124397	I	0	' said Kobba , translating Elnoa 's hand signals in a mellifluous , formal tone that she reserved for Elnoa 's words . She was Elnoa 's voice , a conspicuous luxury since every fem knew handspeech . '
124398	124424	124425	124425	They	1489	'm happy to see my friends Daya and Kobba again . Let them come sit beside me and tell us the news of the plains . '

Kobba 's scouting parties , under the pretense of searching out the best growth of wild tea plants , had penetrated the borderlands as far as the desert , which they were secretly mapping . Elnoa 's stores of food , clothing and weapons were essential . When the time to go drew near , the scouts would distribute Elnoa 's stores in various caches intended to provision and sustain the whole band of free fems on their route homeward . Just how this was to be done without drawing the attention of the Marish patrols was not , it seemed to Daya , very clear . The free fems did not have a high opinion of Marish intelligence . Daya suspected that she was not the only one who thought the plan absurd . The Mares had patrolled the borderlands for generations , preventing the men from learning of their existence and coming over the mountains in force . Marish patrols had never once let a man come as far as the Grasslands ; surely they were capable of preventing fifty fems from returning to the Holdfast . Moreover , those fems who had come out of the Holdfast most recently - years ago now - had brought news of dreadful carnage there as men struggled with each other over ruinously small food supplies . In the years since , no more fems had escaped . Yet Elnoa 's followers chewed tea and discussed their return as if they would find life there much as they had left it . To Daya it was all a game , but she did not disdain the plan . On the contrary , she admired Elnoa for knowing a useful illusion when she saw one . Elnoa ws far too ungainly and soft to make that crossing ever again . She never talked about her own part in the later stages of the plan , and no one ever asked . Daya did not believe for a moment that Elnoa would give them her substance and wave them goodbye , remaining tamely behind to explain their disappearance to the Mares . But what a fine player the great fem was ! She read in signs now from one of her leather books of records , leading off the reports of progress on the plan . She listed how many baskets of dried milk and meat she had added to the permanent stocks from trade with the Mares since her last accounting ; how many metal knives and spear points , how many light cotton smocks and leather tunics , how many pairs of thick - soled sandals . Everyone had a place in the plan . Froya , long - faced and Free Fems 307 supercilious - looking with her drooping , bruise - colored eyelids , recounted the exploits of her troop of scouts . '
125235	125301	125220	125220	We	3670	' she boasted . There was a report on a new design of water bottles for the homeward journey . Old Ossa spoke quaveringly of her efforts , aided by others whose eyes were better , to make colored maps of the Holdfast so that each returning free fem would have a good idea of the territory in which she was to rouse the slaves . '
125307	125329	125220	125220	We	3670	' said Kobba . She got an account of their sessions practicing with spears and hatchets . Daya hid a yawn . '
125333	125375	125376	125376	Alldera	290	' We have a new teacher of running , Elnoa signed . One who came to us just after your wagon left , having at last escaped the Mares who were keeping her among them . Where is Alldera the runner ? '
125380	125403	125404	125404	She	290	' muttered old Ossa , and she spat tea juice into her cup which she held up close to her seamed face . '
125413	125414	125404	125404	She	290	' '
125419	125424	125404	125404	She	290	' someone else said . '

125462	125493	125453	125453	We	3673	' Elnoa signed firmly , Alldera has a skill — her running . That makes her more useful to the plan barefoot than some others who go shod . So the '
125496	125516	125453	125453	We	3673	' had gotten free at last . Daya wondered how she had managed to make enemies here so swiftly . '

125565	125569	125562	125563	a male	3676	' retorted another . '

125629	125642	125626	125626	Kobba	336	' The cub is not in the plan ; the runner is . '
125653	125656	125648	125648	They	3673	' the clowns '
125759	125860	125751	125751	Elnoa	317	' plan talk - making furtive signs to her , commenting sarcastically on each speaker , berating Daya for having abandoned her to go tramping the plains . She forgot very easily that this had been at her own order . Finally , during a pause while Kobba rubbed out some error on her map , Elnoa signed broadly to Daya , You have not satisfied our curiosity about life cooking for Kobba 's wagon crew . Surely you had time at least to make up some new stories . Well , it was about time . Daya said modestly , '
125896	125977	125893	125894	a liar	3684	' They flattered her and cajoled her . She loved the coaxing , which was , after all , her due . To warm them up she told a quick story of Little Fist , a free fern whom she had invented years ago , now the subject of a hundred anecdotes . Shrunken to tiny size by a bolt of plains lightning , Little Fist had wild adventures wandering the Grasslands in her tiny cloak , sneaking into the Mares '
125990	126047	125889	125889	you	3683	' ruins . Today Daya told how Little Fist was hunted remorselessly by a vicious sharu fifty times her size , and how she had pinned its tail to its nose with a cactus spine so that it ran in circles till it died . Then Little Fist did a victory dance on her tiny cloak - '
126061	126065	125889	125889	you	3683	' Emla drawled . '
126076	126120	125889	125889	you	3683	' Her bitchiness did not matter . A story lay ready for them in Daya 's mind , clearly and wholly visible now like a white stone at the bottom of a bowl of water . With a nod at Emla she began . '
126187	126225	126230	126230	she	3692	' Elnoa signs for a brave volunteer to go down into the lower hills Free Fems 309 and find out what has happened . One fem goes , spear on her shoulder , hatchet in her hand . '
126261	126352	126353	126355	The free fem	8256	' Suddenly she sees a figure ahead of her on the road . Drawing near with great effort , she comes upon an old fem in a ragged smock trying to lift a huge wheel of white stone that has fallen on its side , blocking the way . The old fem straightens , wipes her wrinkled face with the hem of her smock , and says to the free fem , " Come help me raise this stone , for I must roll it down to the sea . " '
126396	126407	126375	126375	she	8256	' " Help me , " the old fem says . '
126440	126475	126414	126414	she	8256	' At this , the old fem shrinks away to nothing and vanishes , and the free fem thinks , very well , I have vanquished some evil phantom that would have bewitched me . '
126537	126608	126609	126612	The second free fem	3706	' She walks beside the still river and under the still sky , and she seems to make little headway . Then she sees the old fem before her , bent and straining to lift the wheel of white stone . The old fem calls to her , " Come and help me raise this stone on its edge so that I can roll it down to the sea . " '
126635	126647	126617	126617	you	3706	' " Help me ! " the old fem commands her . '
126695	126749	126750	126752	The third volunteer	3711	' At this the old fem shrinks away to nothing and disappears , but the second free fem finds that the white wheel has swollen so big that she ca n't climb over it or walk around it to continue on her 310 Motherlines way ; so she has to come back too . '
126808	126883	126898	126900	the old fem	1146	' Semda looks at her and thinks , if I had not had the luck and the strength to run away from the Holdfast , I would have withered early like this old fem . And she says , Til do what I can . " To her amazement , she no sooner sets her hand to the stone than up it springs to stand on its edge in the middle of the road . '
126902	126949	126898	126900	the old fem	1146	' That 's a long way , Semda thinks . But she looks at the old fern and thinks also , I was not here to be beaten , but how many blows has she taken ? So she says , " I 'll try . " '
127008	127034	126984	126984	Semda	341	' " Because it is my job and always has been my job and always will be my job , " answers the old fem . '
127047	127140	127045	127045	Semda	341	' " Under no orders , I mark out the time , " says the old fem , and Semda realizes that this is Moonwoman herself . In fear and shock she jumps back from the white stone wheel , which immediately tumbles into the river . The old fem falls in with it . But when Semda runs to look she sees the stone wheel floating on top of the water ; and the old fem , standing on the floating stone , shouts to her , " Jump on ! " '
127233	127287	127288	127290	The old fem	1146	' Semda soon smells the sea , and she leaps onto the shore at the river 's mouth . There is nothing to be seen on the coast but saltgrass and sand and , canted on its side , the great bleached hulk of one of the coastal ferry boats . Free Fems 311 '
127314	127382	127311	127311	she	1146	' Semda walks up to the silent wreck and taps on the wooden wall . Nothing happens . She takes a strong swing and chops right through . A whole section of the hull breaks away , and out of the opening fems come walking , rubbing their eyes , yawning and looking around in astonishment . Moonwoman had hidden them there while she killed the masters . '

127506	127702	127705	127705	her	3743	' on the other side of the mountains , grew here too , though in less abundance . Daya did not care for manna , which produced in her a languorous slowing of the senses . When she took manna she could not concentrate to tell stories . A new person entered the wagon . She sprinkled people with water as she tossed back her rain - wet hair from her face . She was a stranger to Daya and not pretty . Her eyes were small and the bridge of her nose was flattened so that the nostrils seemed by contrast to flare like the nostrils of a horse . She looked to Daya like the kind of fem who liked to fight . Such spirit could be attractive to Daya . The newcomer glanced at Daya and did not bother to hide her contempt . Daya faced that contempt all the time , a prejudice against those who had been the favorites of their masters , coddled for their manners and their looks . The newcomer sniffed the air of the wagon and withdrew into the rain without a word . Daya guessed , '
127711	127752	127755	127755	her	3743	' Kobba was already leaning over the fire , breathing in the drug fumes , and did not reply . But old Ossa , who clearly disliked the runner , circled Daya 's arm with her bony hand and hissed , '
127846	127850	127833	127833	she	3743	' Ossa hooted . '

127979	127989	127990	127990	Daya	305	' She wo n't get herself liked that way , '
127994	128036	127990	127990	Daya	305	' She does n't like any of us . She 's young all over , never a thought for anybody but herself . Staying so long with the Mares made her too good for us . We do n't measure up . '
128037	128042	128043	128043	Kobba	336	' Who says so ? '
128053	128057	128046	128046	She	305	' Not me ! '
128119	128127	128109	128109	Kobba	336	' The Mares are strong , but we 're
128188	128225	128187	128187	They	3757	're scared of us . They know if we ever gave them a fight for their water and grass and herds , they 'd lose it all . But we do n't want what they have . '
128285	128291	128278	128278	Kobba	336	' She wants Daya too . '

128297	128458	128272	128272	she	317	' Daya murmured . She moved Emla 's slack body aside so that she could curl up and pillow her own head on one of Elnoa 's Free Fems 313 enormous thighs . When the rains stopped and the Cool Season began , the trade wagons were ready to resume their journeys out onto the plains . This time it was Emla 's turn to travel , and Daya saw to it that everyone knew Emla was leaving with one of the crews by order of Elnoa . Daya hung about all day when the last wagon was being packed for its journey . The crew stacked it full of chests of wooden tools , ornaments , and great odorous piles of tea brick . There were boxes of small goods , too , utilitarian items like buckles and fine glazed beads . Holdfastish products , Daya thought approvingly , for the wild , ignorant Mares . It was the wagoneers '
128557	128571	128572	128572	Kobba	336	' Daya , you can still come with us if you want to . '

129499	129511	129478	129478	Daya	305	' What 's the witchery in a good , hard kick ? '
129512	129527	129480	129480	Alldera	290	' Who knows what the runner learned , living so long with the Mares . '

129543	129552	129541	129541	Laughter	346	' But it 's Alldera , not Froya . '
129553	129574	129480	129480	Alldera	290	' The runner should have brought us her cub . What right did she have to decide to leave it ? '
129575	129590	129480	129480	Alldera	290	' Ossa 's right about that . Alldera never talks of the cub . We 're
129614	129795	129480	129480	Alldera	290	' Daya noticed that the runner 's name came up in conversation often , and usually with disapproval . There was a mad tale of her trip out , before Daya 's return to camp , with a mapping party headed by Froya . The group had dragged home days overdue , still streaked with desert dust , and complaining bitterly that Alldera had gone off alone into the desert so that they 'd all had to troop after her to bring her back . Taxed with endangering the entire expedition and reminded that , the free fems could ill afford to risk losing anyone , Alldera had defended herself by saying she had thought they were to go into the desert , not just along its edge making drawings of what they could 316 Motherlines see from there . All very true , Daya reflected , if one insisted on taking symbolic action for the real thing . This was a distinction the runner seemed incapable of learning . No wonder she had enemies . Not long after Ossa 's '
129797	130063	129480	129480	Alldera	290	' , Daya heard that Alldera was asking Elnoa to discipline fems who did not turn out for running practice . Daya had to put up with Elnoa 's subsequent ill humor , which included thrown objects , bursts of incoherent and ugly noise when mere gestures would not carry the weight of her anger , and sometimes — praise Moonwoman 's mercy — merely the sulks . She had her work cut out , restoring Elnoa to a decent frame of mind . She wondered how people here could think a pet 's life was all sweet drippings from a master 's plate . Could n't Alldera see that the tea camp went slack when Kobba was gone with a trading crew ? Elnoa worked everyone very hard at weaving and dyeing but did not interfere at all with what else they did . Her business was the accumulation of goods . Kobba 's job , when she returned , was to slam on the discipline again and push ahead with the plan . If Alldera had not worked that out for herself , she was heading for disaster . Daya saw no reason to enlighten her . She knew the type : proud , demanding , impatient , withdrawn into herself out of disappointment with others , but lacking inner resources , particularly imagination . Only action would suit her , and she was not going to get the kind of heroic nonsense that she wanted . Not here . Daya could have told her . Someone came pounding across the yard shouting , '
130077	130611	130069	130070	A Mare	3806	' Roused from a slumbrous afternoon in the big wagon , Daya went with Elnoa to the perimeter of the camp . A Mare as dark - skinned as the horse she rode was down by the spring , in plain sight of the sentries , if there had been any sentries . There was no telling how long she had been waiting there till someone noticed her . Elnoa had Alldera sent for . Daya 's head was full of wild suppositions . She stared down at the rider , fascinated . She had never been this close to one of them for this long with nothing to do but look . She thought the Mare 's Free Fems 317 appearance rather grand . Under the back - thrown headcloth the Mare 's face was an unreadable darkness lit by the glint of her eyes . She led two spare horses by ropes on their necks . How obedient her horses seemed , how patient . Her mount leaned down in a leisurely fashion to rub its head on its foreleg . All of them lacked the scruffy flash of wild horses . Daya wondered what the Mare had done to tame them so completely . They did not look scarred or starved . Alldera appeared below , padding swiftly down the trail to the spring . The yellow tones of the plain , visible beyond the mouth of the valley , had faded as the days lengthened and heated toward the early Dusty Season . Daya imagined the bold Mare riding alone through that landscape , as it was gradually leached of color by the increasing power of the sun . . . The Mare leaned down and as she spoke touched Alldera , a swift flicker of the hand . While trading in Marish camps Daya had often seen them do that among themselves , casually , as if they owned each other . One of the led horses stepped forward and put its nose against Alldera 's shoulder . Alldera laid her hand on its flat forehead . The watching fems stirred . For a moment Daya wished strongly that she were down there too , and she was almost jealous of Alldera . What did it feel like to be touched by a woman as black as char and to stroke a creature that was not even human at all ? Alldera and the black Mare talked in distant voices . The runner 's voice seemed choppy and hard , the Mare 's richly liquid . An experienced storyteller 's voice , Daya thought , and what an attentive audience she had in the fems strung out along the wall of wood and brush and stone on the hillside above . She was so black , a dramatic shadow - person ; she gave Daya the shivers . Alldera nodded curtly to the Mare and turned back up toward the tea camp . All the fems began to talk excitedly at once . The Mare gathered her headcloth about her shoulders and rode away down the valley with her horses . When Alldera came to Elnoa she said , '
130649	130665	130623	130623	She	3809	' 318 Motherlines What are you supposed to do ? Elnoa signed . Alldera shrugged . '
130669	130675	130676	130676	Froya	338	'm just supposed to know . '
130683	130694	130676	130676	Froya	338	' You told us the cub was nothing to you . '
130695	130707	130708	130708	Alldera	290	' It 's important to Stone Dancing Camp that I know , '
130716	130733	130708	130708	Alldera	290	' The rider comes of a bloodline that cares a lot about doing what 's right . '
130734	130743	130744	130744	Froya	338	' If the Mares did what was right , '
130747	130773	130744	130744	Froya	338	' they would have brought your cub to us . If they did what was right , they would n't let their horses screw them . '
130789	130804	130782	130782	Froya	338	' Do you think she 's fucked with that brown one she was riding ? '
130805	130808	130809	130809	Alldera	290	' Idiot , '
130814	130832	130809	130809	Alldera	290	' she was riding a mare . Ca n't you tell a male horse from a female ? '
130845	130854	130855	130855	she	338	' From this distance only an expert could , '
130858	130870	130855	130855	she	338	' Someone who knows them as well as the Mares do . '
130886	130909	130879	130879	Froya	338	' Oh no , I know your fancy kicks ; you could put my eye out while I was watching your hands . '
130917	130955	130910	130911	The runner	538	' It 's not my fault that you do n't know how to block a kick or throw one . I offered to teach kick fighting , remember ? Only some people decided it was too dangerous . '
131318	131328	131314	131314	she	3657	' Sorry , I thought I heard voices inside . '

132400	132413	132414	132414	Thief	3873	' They murmured ; some faces showed uncertainty . Then Emla yelled , '
132424	132427	132441	132441	Alldera	290	're wearing ? '
132428	132440	132441	132441	Alldera	290	' I traded Lora a bag of pine nuts for it . '
132464	132469	132455	132455	Daya	305	' Go ask Lora . '
132585	132594	132595	132595	Alldera	290	' Who are you to give me orders ? '
132598	132600	132595	132595	Alldera	290	' You 're
132621	132703	132595	132595	Alldera	290	' Elnoa stared at her . The bracelet of blue stones was wrapped around her thick fingers like a weapon . Go away , she signed . You are lucky not to be treated more harshly . Perhaps you have done this , perhaps not . You are an arrogant young know - it - all . I think you would like to take our goods and run off to be rich among your Marish friends . Alldera rejoined her fiercely , '
132717	132729	132595	132595	Alldera	290	' Edging closer to her , Daya whispered in anguished agitation , '
132733	132745	132732	132732	you	0	're in danger here ! You 've really made her angry ! '
133164	133171	133172	133172	Lexa	349	' A rebel and a thief , '
133203	133209	133200	133200	One	597	' What did she steal ? '
133225	133230	133221	133221	Kobba	336	' Listen or disperse . '
133234	133295	133221	133221	Kobba	336	' She said she was just going running as usual , but when we said no she tried to get by us . There was still mist on the ground . If she 'd slipped past us , she 'd have been hard to find . She could have looted every cache in the hills and been on her way — '
133296	133304	133305	133305	Kobba	336	' How did the sentries get hurt ? '
133308	133319	133305	133305	Kobba	336	' Were the Mares waiting out there to help her ? '
133320	133335	133336	133336	Lexa	349	' She was just going right by us as if we were n't there , '
133340	133387	133336	133336	Lexa	349	' She said we 'd had time to dig new holes like the sharu do - that 's what she said , ask the others — so our treasures were safe and she was n't going to sit around and get fat because we were afraid . '
133436	133474	133475	133475	Elnoa	317	' Well , we went at her . Nobody used a weapon , you can see that , but I think she 's got some cracked ribs . She hurt us , and we hurt her back . '
133738	133751	133729	133729	Emla	337	' Too bad the runner no longer runs — except to fat . '
133770	133858	133859	133859	She	3920	' hands seemed to have broken her . She moved slowly about the camp , bent as if in pain . Daya heard people say Alldera had brought it on herself , but their hostility was blunted ; there were rumors that certain unnamed free fems privately agreed with some of her assertions . A few openly pitied her and blamed Daya , who knew that her part in the affair was common supposition . The whole situation was unjust . It was not Daya 's fault . '
133869	133883	133859	133859	She	3920	' Emla said , turning a small stone bottle in her supple hands . '
133958	133971	133949	133949	She	3920	' Ugh , this smells awful , what was Fedeka thinking of ? '
133972	133981	133982	133982	Daya	305	' Why , of you , sweet friend , '
133986	134000	133982	133982	Daya	305	' She told me especially to give that one to you from her . '
134041	134069	134035	134035	Emla	337	' Do n't show that nightmare face to me , Daya . I 've put worse scars than that on the faces of fems who crossed me . '
134084	134097	134073	134073	Daya	305	' I 'll take these in now that you 've inspected them . '
134364	134377	134357	134357	Alldera	290	' I want to go out with one of the wagon crews . '
134436	134452	134433	134433	Alldera	290	' I know the Mares . I could help the wagon crew bargain with them . '
134560	134570	134545	134545	her	317	' I do n't think they 'd miss me . '
134627	134629	134617	134617	she	317	' I 'm
134646	134917	134617	134617	she	317	' Elnoa tilted her chin , stretching the line of her neck under Emla 's hand . She signed , You have sometimes expressed a strong dislike of the way we do things . Alldera did not speak . At least she was learning when to keep still , Daya noted . She hoped Elnoa would grant the runner 's request to go out with a crew . She did not want Alldera around forever , a living reminder of her own disastrous miscalculation . Elnoa signed , Maybe you can still learn to fit in here despite your strange background . I will see what my crew captains say . Come back and we will talk about this . Daya heard her suck on the sweet fragments stuck to her teeth — a revolting habit . Alldera returned to her place across the yard and sat down again slowly . Exasperated , Daya slapped another blanket over the railing . She knew the signs . Elnoa was in a playful mood ; she would keep Alldera begging , never refusing , never agreeing . Perhaps she was taking vengeance for the runner 's criticisms of her . Daya could see the complacent smile on Elnoa 's face as the big fem leader leaned back and let the weight of her shoulders rest against Emla 's oiled palms . Later , when both had gone in , Daya crossed the yard . She knelt near Alldera and began pulling twigs and branches out from under the wagon , selecting fuel for cooking the day 's meals . Softly she said , '
135022	135023	135024	135024	You	3942	' '
135031	135047	135024	135024	You	3942	' Alldera 's tone was neutral , unreadable , and she did not look up . '
135078	135425	135071	135072	No one	5106	' Alldera did not answer . Daya left her in a damp cloud of tea pungence and smoke . It was the runner 's mistake if she chose to ignore such a good suggestion . She and Alldera were quits now ; the runner no longer mattered . At the old tea - camp site , screened by trees near the spring , Daya took leaf fragments from the pouch at her belt and chewed them . She undressed and anointed herself with the leaf saliva . Shivering slightly in the evening chill , she smeared her nipples , the insides of her thighs , and her vulva , making them fragrant . She did not do this for Elnoa . For some time Elnoa had not sent for her . She slept these nights with Tua , but she did not sweeten herself for Tua either . They bedded together only because each of them was partnerless . She prepared so elaborately to make love because she knew she excelled in this preparation , and she was proud of her skill at it . Then she lay down in her blankets under the shelter of the abandoned wagon . She had not trysted here since going trading — two years or more ? Too long . She looked out at the clouds piled deep into the darkening sky , preparing new assaults on the mountains . Good . When making love she liked the drumming of distant rain and the drama of far thunder . She enjoyed seeing her companion 's eyes glinting greedily in the flash of the lightning . Let the rest of them keep to the stuffy wagons , descending to the floor to make love while others peered down at them from the sleeping platforms above . Though that was exciting in its own way , to know people were heating themselves on your own heat . . . Tua stood above her in the twilight , and Daya raised up on one elbow to greet her and draw her down . '
135428	135433	135436	135436	you	3950	' Tua said eagerly , '
135447	135454	135442	135442	Alldera	290	' Daya caught at her hand . '
135459	135464	135466	135466	Motherlines	290	'm ready for you . '
135467	135470	135471	135471	Tua	352	' Imagine ! '
135478	135504	135471	135471	Tua	352	' Bet she 's gone back to the Mares . What 's Elnoa going to say ? What will Kobba do when she finds out ? '
135505	135512	135513	135513	Daya	305	' She 'll have a cub . '
135517	135523	135513	135513	Daya	305	' Lie down with me . '
135524	135535	135471	135471	Tua	352	' But this is important ! Are n't you excited ? '
135536	135548	135549	135549	She	305	' Yes I am ; and this is what 's important . '
135798	135805	135806	135806	she	336	' We gather tonight , fems , '
135809	135848	135806	135806	she	336	' to try once more to find a starter that will make new life in us . The Mares conceive without men , and so will we - but we wo n't turn to beasts to do it . '

136097	136131	136085	136085	I	0	' It was always damp down there . We worked by lamplight . The rust cough ate out everyone 's voice in the end . But I did n't stay till the end . '

I jumped out when he passed me and I broke his neck . I rammed his chin up so hard I almost tore the head off his body . I 'd never thought to do anything with my strength before but beat on the metal heaps and on any fems who bothered me . I never saw how easy it would have been to smash the life out of those men that stood around telling me what to do all my life . '

If we find the men all dead , that 's all right too — we should have young fems there with us to help us break the men 's bones and their buildings and trample everything of theirs and bury them in a foot of sea salt , so our cubs will know what their freedom is . If Moonwoman wills it , nothing will be left to show that men ever lived in the world , but our cubs will be there to show that we did . '
136582	137504	136580	136581	The fems	623	' faces were bright with hope that this time one of the douches would work . Daya did not believe this would ever happen , but she was pleased to be the dispenser of Fedeka 's mixtures on these welcome days of feasting , love , and hopes . At least Fedeka knew the plants of the plains so well that the douches were sure to be safe . Free fems no longer poisoned themselves in their efforts to conceive , as in the past . Personally , Daya had no particular wish to become bloated with pregnancy ever again , whether from a man or one of Fedeka 's brews . She did like the warm flooding of her body . It was a feeling that no man with his imperceptible squirtings of lukewarm stuff had ever induced . She even enjoyed the feel of the syringe itself . Early on in the Holdfast she had seen that a pet 's life included a lot more fucking than the life of an ordinary labor fem ; she had made herself enjoy , and had later come to crave , the sensations of penetration . There were those , she knew , who found her desire to be entered perverse . She could only be sorry for them , wretches whose experience had been limited to monthly battering by men pressed to do their copulatory duty in the Holdfast breeding rooms . Men who liked the bodies of fems were rare in the Holdfast . In Tua she had found a friend who knew how to serve her tastes without open disgust . When the others were all gone , Daya and Tua found a corner for themselves in one of the wagons . Daya lay with her upper body hugged between Tua 's legs while Tua worked the syringe pipe slower or faster , at a deeper or shallower angle , whatever pleased Daya , until Daya lifted her hips from the rumpled bedding and rode the flooding instrument to her climax . The syringe , filled from Tua 's bowl , was pressed into Daya 's hand . She turned , gathering the body 's heavy center in her arms and gliding her cheek up Tua 's soft inner thigh . Before dawn she was wakened by obscure discomfort . It was not , as she had thought at first , something bad in her gut . The sensation was of a burning in her lower belly and vagina . The wagon was full of the sounds of sleepers . On the floor a fem Free Fems 331 gasped her way laboriously toward orgasm — probably old Ossa , who always went back for a second round of douche . If no one could be induced to lie with her , she would manage by herself , fingering her own body to its climax . The burning feeling flickered out . Daya settled herself in her bedding , which was still damp from the douche . By morning she was feverish . She curled , moaning around her pain . She felt people handling her , trying to straighten out her limbs , washing out her vagina and lifting her onto a pile of soft blankets at the back of Elnoa 's wagon . She tried not to cry out . There was Tua standing over her , weepily repeating that it could not be her fault . Then Tua was gone , sent away . Elnoa could not bear whiners . They did not abandon Daya in her trouble . Someone was with her all the time , burning sweet - scented herbs in the fire bowls , gently restraining her when she sought to dig the pain out of her own body with her nails . It was she who , because of the wandering of her mind , felt herself leaving them . As she lay burning it seemed to her that her head was swollen vast enough to contain whole populations ; she could not understand how the wagon held her . She kept hearing the cracking of the short , split - ended switches that young male overseers used to drive labor fems . She smelled the scents that had mingled in Master Kazzaro 's private chamber . She tasted the flavor of someone 's body - her old lover the pet Merika , coming to her to receive solace . Or maybe it was the limping fem , name forgotten now , who had taken Daya under her protection down in the kitchens ; she had applied salves to Daya 's cheeks , vainly trying to repair the jagged holes torn by the broiling spit . The pain in her body was surely the pain of cubbing , but this place was not the Holdfast hospital . There was no screaming here . She was fed broth . She thought hazily , How sorry they are for me , how angry with the unknown fem who 's killed me . Someone was bending over her , mumbling , breathing on her , tugging at her legs - Ossa . Old Ossa was dragging at her . At first it seemed like another vision . Daya pushed at Ossa , but the old creature slapped her hands away and continued dragging her toward the far end of 332 Motherlines the wagon . Looking up suddenly , Ossa smiled at someone behind Daya and panted , '
137524	137545	137548	137548	you	0	' The other person leaned down to take hold of Daya 's shoulders . It was Kobba . She said , '

137573	137587	137588	137588	I	0	' the old fem whispered , tugging alternately at Daya and at Kobba . '

137658	137687	137655	137655	Ossa	339	' She 's breathing sickness on us all . Help me toss her outside . Ca n't you smell it ? Her decay makes the whole wagon stink . '
137688	137708	137709	137709	Kobba	336	' That 's the smell of all the medicines we 've been trying on her . Let her go ! '

137823	137883	137884	137884	Fems	335	' She wept a little , sniffed , and shuffled off . It was good to have strong friends who could drive away one 's enemies with a frown and a sharp word . Daya watched Kobba 's squinting face floating above her and prayed to Moonwoman for an end to her pain . Kobba 's voice said harshly , '
137901	137951	137952	137952	She	3993	' Daya turned as much as the pain would allow . Kobba was standing near her , rolling up a leather window to let in daylight . Elnoa reclined on her couch of cushions . No one else was there . Elnoa signed , She may after all recover . '
138009	138058	138007	138007	them	308	' Elnoa signed something Daya could not see ; her vision kept washing in and out of focus . Her throat was burning . She could not understand why they went on talking , ignoring her , when she needed something to drink so badly . Kobba said , '
138078	138176	138177	138177	Hush	353	' Passionately Daya explained to them that she was too valuable to be let die . It came into her head that she had offended them with her scarred smile , that they did not want to look at her . She promised not to smile again , ever . No one seemed to hear her . Kobba went on talking , louder and louder , until darkness enfolded and protected Daya from the sound . Why were they moving her , did n't they know how she hurt ? She wept and flinched from their hands . '
138179	138186	138187	138187	we	3996	' Tua whispered in her ear , '
138188	138194	138196	138196	she	3997	're trying to help you . '
138241	138247	138248	138248	Daya	305	' Do n't let Emla , '
138753	138761	138744	138744	she	0	' we both have beaten bad luck . '
138955	139302	139303	139303	Fedeka	351	'S CAMP 8 I could kill her , Alldera thought grimly , looking at the pet fem 's scarred , sleeping face : choke her , slice her throat . Her little game with Emla 's bracelet wrecked me . Without even meaning to she did it . She sent me here to Fedeka ( out of guilt ; it cancels things out ) . And she came here nearly dead herself ( that cancels things too ) . Alldera sat sewing strips of colored cloth together . The outside walls of Fedeka 's small tent were covered with similar strips that had been dyed in Fedeka 's battered dye pots and fastened on with a stitch or two to weather and fade . They fluttered outside in the breeze like faint voices . Alldera worked close to the fire . The Cool Season was well advanced and the morning sun brought bright light but little warmth . She wore a cloth tunic under her leather shirt and kept her feet curled near the flames . There was no room to stretch her legs . With two guests and Fedeka 's bundles and pouches and baskets cramped inside , the leather walls bulged . Sometimes Alldera took her blankets and slept outside in spite of the cold , just for the freedom to straighten her limbs . Her ribs still ached in the mornings when she got up : Daya 's fault . Even Fedeka could not promise complete recovery , for Alldera was no youngster any more - a disquieting surprise , to realize that - who would heal easily and completely . If this pet bitch says the wrong thing when she wakes up I 'll wring her neck . 338 Motherlines The needle jabbed and Alldera yelped . Then she saw Daya 's eyes open just a line and Daya 's leg strain furtively to loosen the blankets in case she should have to run . Let her try . It felt good to see the pet fem afraid . Alldera said briskly , '
139325	139339	139315	139315	she	351	' Daya 's eyes , enormous in her wasted face , opened wide . '

Daya could not stop staring at her . How strong and brown she looked , how effortlessly she commanded the horses . Her eyes were bright with excitement , and she grinned and grinned like some exuberant spirit . Daya had never seen Alldera like that . Alldera drew water for the horses and tied their front feet loosely together with leather to keep them from straying out of the hollow . She pulled off her tattered clothes and sluiced herself down with cold water . Then she settled under the trees draped in a blanket . Brewing up tea , she told them what she had done . She kept laughing in the middle of what she said and reaching to clasp their hands as . she spoke . '
143551	143712	143547	143547	I	0	' Daya marveled . She basked in the vitality of Alldera 's muscular body . She had an urge to touch Alldera , to hug her around the waist . Alldera had gone from watering hole to seeping spring , all the places where water somehow persisted through the Dusty Season weather in amounts too small for the herds of the Riding Women but enough for a wild band . Where she found recent horse tracks , she waited . The wild horses , a roaming troop of fifteen , returned to drink . 348 Motherlines Scenting her presence , they ran away . Alldera followed . She did not need to keep them in sight . She had only to jog along on their tracks until she came upon them where they had stopped to graze . At the sight of her they bolted again . Again she followed , and so it went for a number of days . '

There was a roan mare that acted as if she 'd been gentled before ; stolen from some women 's herd by the stud , probably . I cut her some grass and she let me handle her a bit . By the time the horses were rested enough to make it hard for me to keep up with them , she let me ride her . I just lay back on her rump at first , until she and the others accepted what I was doing . Then I sat up and rode Fedeka 's Camp 349 properly . What a luxury , to be carried after all that walking ! But I only did enough riding to keep up . I did n't want to wear her out . '

Into the tent they went together , getting in each other 's way as they laid out Alldera 's long unused bedding . Their lovemaking was not a great success for Daya . She needed to feel overwhelmed by a force of nature , swept to a place of infinite security and delight where she could safely let herself melt . She found Alldera a conscious sort of lover , possibly self - conscious to an added degree with a partner whom she knew to be unusually experienced . Daya could feel her thinking all the time . It did not seem to matter much . They fell asleep hugged tight together and breathing each other 's warm breath . 10 '
145038	145086	145087	145087	They	4156	' Sheel and Nenisi sat together in a sunny patch outside the tent of Nenisi 's cousins , where Nenisi was staying during the Gather . Nenisi looked just as she always had . The darkskinned lines hardly aged at all , Sheel thought . She added , '

They would reassemble to welcome the child when she was ripe to emerge from the childpack . Meanwhile Shayeen kept Holdfaster Tent 352 Motherlines running as a shelter for visitors unable , for one reason or another , to stay with their own relatives in Stone Dancing . Nenisi said , '

Easy enough for me , she thought now ; I just hate the fems , no complications . Nenisi 's feelings are all gummed up with rights and wrongs . Does she know how she really feels ? She saw Nenisi 's pride , the Conor pride in being right . It was a Conor trait and part of Nenisi 's beauty . Once Sheel had been comfortable with Nenisi , before Holdfaster Family . '
145727	146328	146332	146332	they	4185	' Next day the huge camp of the Gather , a camp composed of all the women 's camps , was quiet . The games and the races and the settling of quarrels were all over ; the time for the mating drew near . Women filed in and out of the sweat tents all day long . Sheel sat quietly cleaning and repairing the belongings of her tent with other women . They all went inside during a brief , hard shower of rain at midday . In the afternoon Sheel , among the last women to use a sweat tent , Fedeka 's Camp 353 walked out toward the great dancing ground outside camp . She shook out her clean wet hair and swirled her long leather cloak in elaborate passes . The sound of the capes whishing through the air drew the women from their tents . Talking and laughing , they joined the growing procession flowing out of the camp . Looking back , her arms already aching from wielding the weight of the cape , Sheel saw the sailing cloaks like a camp of tents taking flight over grass still bright with beads of rain . The childpacks of the camps swarmed among the women , circling , piping and screaming , ducking under the billowing leather , diving into gaps between the walkers . Around and around the dancing ground the procession flowed until it formed a noisy wall of women ringing the flat space . Overhead great ragged cloaks of cloud streamed slowly across the clean blue sky . The moon , a mere edge away from full , was a fragile white disc against the blue . In a little while the first childpack went racing away from the dance ground , scattering out on the plain . Others followed . Several packs sorted themselves out of a whirling free - for - all and ran in another direction . Too excited by the procession to stay afterward for a dull dance , the children preferred to ambush each other over the thick southern turf or harry the horses left unattended . If they returned too soon , there were women stationed outside the dancing ground to turn them away , with whips if necessary . As the early risen moon grew more substantial , a channel opened through the women 's ranks . Horses poured into the circle , all stallions , nervous at having been separated from the mares . Those women who had walked the horses to the dancing ground closed the gap , penning them in . The horses milled inside the human enclosure , calling , darting one way and then another . Her arms linked in those of the women on either side of her , Sheel whooped and stamped with them when the horses ran near her sector of the crowd , and the beasts whirled back the way they had come . Her voice skirled joyfully in her throat , she threw her freshwashed hair from side to side as if it were the mane . Let the land stretch dry and dusty over the rocky bones of the world ; the horses were a tumultuous river flowing past her , rough , swift , life - sharing . Now the young women who had been working with the horses for months had their moment . Dropping their cloaks , they stepped from the crowd and ran naked among the horses . Amid the plung- 354 Motherlines ing shadows they swung up onto the studs '
146482	146665	146477	146477	you	4192	' dismay at finding their horses worn out . When you were grown you danced the stallions under the round moon before all the women . You felt your strength flow to the horses , and then back again to you , made stronger . All beings found their rightful places in these exchanges , and the balance of all things was reaffirmed . A young Hont woman came whirling out of the mob , a bay horse with her . It curvetted past her , rearing and shaking its head , and then turned back to come to her shoulder and rub its knobby face against her . The Hont 's mothers came out to lead her and the lathered horse quietly away , both to be prepared for mating tomorrow . By dawn the last stallion and the last dancer had been escorted away , the dust had settled , and the bedding chute was built . The Hilliars had put it together this year , in the neat casual - looking way that they did everything . Some called it '
146668	146843	146844	146844	I	0	' because this was the horse 's turn to ride . It was a rectangular box with three closed sides , an open top , and a high floor . The insides of the floor and walls were padded with leather cushions . Arched across the open top and joining the two long walls was a carefully padded super - structure to take the weight of the stallion and the grip of his forelegs . It would suspend his body over the young woman lying inside the box . There were ropes to release an escape trap for a woman whose mating went wrong and endangered her . The women assembled as they had for the dancing , forming an Fedeka 's Camp 355 oval of spectators surrounding the bedding chute . Here a voice rose in song , there another . The members of each Motherline sang all the self - songs of the past generations of their line . The singing of each Motherline unfurled like a banner against the paling sky . '
146856	148824	146844	146844	I	0	' sang a yellow woman next to Sheel . That was an old song from the days before the camps had discarded streambeds as boundaries because they were places of confrontation and fighting . Sheel sang the song of her own bloodmother . It was composed largely of affectionate descriptions of the horses the woman had taken during her lifetime of raiding , and the names of women she had faced in feuds and duels . Sheel sang it with passionate pride . The moist wind stirred the hair of the young Hont candidate who stepped first into the open . She was thickset like all her line , but the simple leather cloak she wore disguised her body 's lack of grace . With her clean golden hair falling down her back , she looked her best . You forgot the big - featured Hontish face . Sheel approved , and found the Hont 's showing off appealing . The youngster strolled the circumference of the dance ground , smiling , waving to women who called her name in the midst of their singing . Someone slipped an arm through Shed 's : Barvaran , her red face shining with happiness . She herself had been to the stud horses three times , and she had three living bloodchildren as robust and goodnatured as herself . Sheel thought of her own two blooddaughters , one lost in the pack and the other to an epidemic of fever . She no longer grieved for them or for her own failure to bring adult daughters to her Motherline . It was true , as women said ; no one rides only one horse on a long journey . There were all the daughters of her sisters and her cousinlines , young women as like to her own dead bloodchildren as they were to Sheel and to each other . She sang a brief self - song for the child which had lived long enough to come out of the pack , and then her own self - song of hunts , raids , and the deaths of men . The Hont climbed into the chute and lay down on her back . One of her sharemothers got in with her to encourage and caress her so she would be moist and open to her stud . Sheel remembered well feeling the smooth wooden rests against which she had braced her bare feet and watching the support frame dark against the sky . Poli Rois , her friend , had lain down with her , kissing her neck . 356 Motherlines Poli was gone now many years , struck dead in her saddle by lightning while still a youth . Into the circle of onlookers came two of the Hont 's family . The bay stallion stepped along neatly between them . They walked with their hands on his withers and his neck . They talked into his flicking ears . Small , sedate , groomed so the sunlight shimmered on his hide , he was scarcely recognizable as one of the wild - eyed studs of last night 's dance . His feet were filed and oiled , and ribbons of dyed leather were braided into his mane and tail . He was called Tiptoe , and was bred from the home herd of Salmowon Tent in Melting Earth Camp . Sheel 's first stud had been a nameless chestnut with a lop ear . She had looked up and seen his familiar crooked silhouette and the little beard of whiskers on his jaw , so well known to her and so ridiculous that all her fear had dissolved . Awe and joy had filled her , that the instrument of her own joining with the great patterns of the world should be so ordinary a creature . Well , so was she , yet both she and the stud embodied the dependence of all beings on each other and the kinship of creatures . That was the mystery of the mating , its beauty and necessity . She had spoken softly to him above the singing voices of the gathered women , and he had entered her as smoothly as the staff of oiled leather with which she had stretched herself in practice for him . After the culling that year his flesh had gone to help nourish the child he had started in her belly . Her second stud , a barrel - bodied gray , had sired a number of fine foals after mating with her . She had ridden him for years until an infected sharu slash had made it impossible for him to keep up with the herd any more . It had taken two hammer blows to drop him for butchering . Poor Cloud . The singing had sunk to a soft murmur . The faces of other women showed Sheel that they too were thinking of the dead ; dead horses , dead children , dead women who had bled to death after bad matings . The handlers rubbed the neck and chest of the little stallion . They stroked his face and nostrils with pads that had been run under the tails of mares in season . He began to throw his head and snort , and within a few moments they had him erect . Under the touch of hands well known to him he reared high and clamped his forelegs on the Fedeka 's Camp 357 padded support frame . He gripped the leather roll at the chute 's head and rattled it with his teeth . Standing outside the chute , the handlers stroked his sweating neck and shoulders and bent to guide him . Suddenly he thrust forward against the wooden braces which prevented him from entering fully . He oscillated his rump , snorting loudly , and his tail jerked , marking the rhythm of his ejaculation . Within seconds , it seemed , he pulled back and stood dark with sweat , droop - headed , quiet . The handlers praised and patted him as they led him away to rejoin the herd . He left between them as modestly as he had arrived . Others of her family reached to help the young Hont up , but she was already on her feet in the chute . She swung her robe about herself with a grand gesture that showed as well as anything could her triumphant success . They closed around her , checking her for injury , mopping the milky overflow from her thighs . With her arms on the shoulders of two of them , she walked briskly from the dance ground . A new candidate had already stepped out from the crowd . A sorrel horse , thick - maned and heavy - headed , came into the circle . Snorting at the crowd , he bounced along half sideways . Sheel knew that horse . She had taken him from the herds of Chowmer Tent in Windgrass Camp last year . She hoped he was smoother as a rider than he was as a mount . She thought angrily of Nenisi . The black woman was mad to insist that the child of a fem could lie down for a stud like a woman . Holdfaster Tent was just a dream anyway , Nenisi 's fantasy of righteousness . There was a story about a free fem , long ago — she had been taken up briefly by the Golashamets because she had looked so much like them . She had attended a mating , just once . Women said that after the first stud , the fem had turned and vomited on the woman next to her . 11 When the cool months started the three fems returned to the plain . They brought the horses that Alldera had caught . Fedeka 's open dislike of the animals abated when she saw that not only could they help carry baggage from campsite to campsite , but they could bear many more than the number of plant samples that she normally packed on her own back . For Daya , their presence was magical ; she rode whenever she could . She had begun , timidly , to learn how under Alldera 's tutelage and had discovered a horse 's power to transform its rider . Alldera had made Daya a saddle of padded leather sewn wet onto a wooden frame so as to shrink as it dried to make a strong seat . The saddle was trimmed with straps and strings to lash on bottles , blankets , and other equipment . The leather required frequent applications of soap and oils to keep it supple and uncracked . Daya used the heavy saddle gladly on long rides , but she loved better riding bareback , seat and legs fitted to the horse 's body , wearing pants cut off at the knee so that she could feel the living flank of the horse along her calves . The dun mare had a big , ugly head and at rest its lower lip drooped and exposed its yellow teeth in a comical , foolish - looking manner . But it was responsive , almost tireless , Daya 's favorite mount . Alldera said with a trace of jealousy that Daya was a natural rider . She admitted to Daya that she herself did not love the horses ; what she loved was having the mastery of them . Daya loved their rich appeal to her senses and the joining of her own meager strength Fedeka 's Camp 359 to their power . Crouched on the shoulders of her galloping mount , she reveled in the ecstasy of speed . Alldera often had to remind her that the Mares did not gallop everywhere and that Daya too should practice the slower , less wearing gaits . Riding under drifts of illuminated cloud , Daya dreamed of tearing down the far side of the mountains scattering terrified men , battering them down with the shoulders of her mount and pounding them under its hooves . Her horse was invincible . She heard in her mind the thudding of heavy , blunt blows on flesh and the crack of bone . Or she dreamed of nothing at all , but lived totally and raptly in the warm , driving reach of her horse under her . On foot little changed for her . She still spoke softly , moved automatically out of another 's way and shed tears instead of shouting when she was angry . She knew these ways were forever part of herself , not to be changed by her joy in the horses and the new strength that they had lent her . As she rode with Alldera , Daya began to talk about their former lives and even to ask questions about Alldera 's adventures with her two outlaw masters in the last days of the Holdfast . Alldera seldom raged against Elnoa 's free fems any more . Now when she spoke of them it was painfully , questioning earnestly why they were as they were . Sometimes she would ask Daya for an opinion and then ride silently a while before replying , if she replied at all . They slept together only occasionally , yet Daya felt them growing closer , knit together by quiet conversations and companionship . The gradual weaving of this connection delighted Daya and frightened her ; it was new , an unreadable part of the mystery of the horses . Sometimes they talked about Alldera 's years with the Mares .

Sitting on the dun mare 's back , Daya looked down at the sunlight breaking on the water and spreading in circles from the mare 's hot muzzle . Her hands moved over the sleek shoulders , feeling the glide and pull of muscle under the skin as the animal stepped forward , lifting its dripping mouth . A tightening of the rein , a tap of the heels , and it would move on , obedient to the will of the small , weak creature on its back . A person with this power would not be just a runaway fem among the Mares . If riding were all there was to it . . . '

It would be dreadful to be abandoned among strangers once Alldera had settled with the Mares again and wearied of the novelty of showing off her pretty pet friend . She said , '
149206	149211	149212	149212	They	3051	' Alldera looked impatient . '

149318	149462	149463	149463	They	4213	' Daya murmured . By the time the Dusty Season came , Fedeka was talking with undisguised anticipation of the rendezvous with one of the trade wagons toward which they slowly made their way . She had been acting more and more distant , and Daya knew that with Fedeka it could not be jealousy . Probably the dyer was just tired of company and hoped that her two guests would join the wagon and leave her to wander on . It seemed to Daya that Alldera was not likely to find a welcome with the tea fems , but there was no point in talking to Fedeka 's Camp 361 Fedeka about that . The trade wagon was not at the wells of Steep Cloud Camp where they had expected to meet it . Fedeka glared with frustration at the stubbled flats . '
149472	149476	149463	149463	They	4213	' she said . '
149496	149739	149492	149492	We	4214	' The hot , dry days dragged past . No one talked about what was to happen when the wagon finally did arrive , and this increased the tension of waiting . Alldera and Daya endured it , riding out daily in search of grass for the horses . They were returning one evening , discussing the possibility of trading for grain from the Mares to sustain their animals , when a sudden rush of hoofbeats engulfed them . The dark heads and shoulders of running horses dodged around them . The dun mare bolted , throwing her head forward so suddenly that she jerked the rein from Daya 's hand . For thirty long strides , gasping in fear and exultation , Daya clung with her fingers twined in the dun 's mane . Then something slammed at her body . Offbalanced , she jumped for her life , rolling like an acrobat when she hit the ground so that she ended up standing on wavering legs . The dun ran on in the dust of the other horses , holding her head high and to one side so as not to tread on the reins hanging from her mouth . A rider came toward Daya - Alldera , surely . Two riders , three , half a dozen ; all in a rush they flowed around her , a wall of horses , faces peering down at her past the horses '

150149	150181	150100	150105	the woman who lent you horses	4227	' Daya whispered , clutching Alldera 's arm . The tears of anger welled in her eyes . Alldera grasped the woman 's rein just under the jaw of her mount . '

150327	150498	150320	150320	I	0	' The high hoops of the long expected trade wagon loomed beside Fedeka 's fire . As they rode in , Roona 's crew sprang up . Daya saw faces well known to her from Elnoa 's camp . It occurred to her that the crew fems may have expected fems on horseback , but never a Fedeka 's Camp 363 Mare riding with them . These closed , defensive masks that greeted her must be what fems often presented to the eyes of the Mares . Now she sat a saddle herself and looked uncomfortably down at her own people . The captive woman ignored them all . She dismounted stiffly after Roona invited her to . She politely tasted everything they offered her to eat . No one spoke to her . When she went to lie down a little distance off , curled in her blanket beside her hobbled horse , the fems all crowded into the wagon . Roona turned at once to Daya and said , '
150509	150541	150578	150578	she	342	' Daya told them . The fems grew furious at Alldera : what would the Mares do in return ? they cried ; what would happen to the trade , the fems '

They would take it out on all the fems . A few said darkly that the whole thing was a trick of Alldera 's , too complicated for them to understand . Others , their first panic eased , spoke in tones of shy admiration . Fedeka gripped Alldera 's hand and pumped it to punctuate the single point she made over and over . '
151020	151252	151018	151018	Moonwoman	255	' She gave up and retreated into silence when Daya admitted that she was going to Stone Dancing Camp too . The atmosphere in the wagon became quiet , but distinctly strained . Daya went outside to see that the horses were securely hobbled for the night . Clouds masked the moon 's bright face , and all the sky seemed crowded with heavy shapes edged in brilliant light . There was so much life in the sky here , she thought , even at night . She went to the horses and stood among them , rubbing their soft noses and lips and the muscles behind their ears , grateful for their undemanding warmth . The hostility she had felt in the wagon worried her . Maybe she had made a wrong decision . But she did not want to go back with Roona 's crew to the tea camp . She did not want to have to figure out — for her own safety — who had tried to poison her in that whirl of passion and intrigue around Elnoa . The suspicion and selfabsorption of the wagon crew tonight had struck her as strange and unpleasant . Now that she rode a horse herself the idea of staying a while among the Mares seemed less alien . She would have to be careful not to use the insulting term '

The horses grazed nearby . Alldera packed up . Daya did the same . The dark young Mare , Patarish Rois , sat watching in the shadow of her horse while working at her kinky black ringlets with a wooden comb . The fems watched from the wagon . Daya said , '

More women arrived , murmuring greetings , patting and embracing earlier arrivals as they took their places to sit . Everywhere were soft sounds of whispering and movement . The first of the tea was passed in shallow wooden bowls holding no more than a couple of swallows each . Daya took a pouch from her belt and poured some shavings of tea into her own food bowl . Among such rough folk she felt it was only right for a civilized person to make the gracious gesture the occasion called for , even if it beggared her and was not properly appreciated . She passed the bowl . The Mares looked curiously at this offering . Each one took a bit as long as the supply held out , though none chewed it as fems would have done . Alldera had warned Daya that to soften bad feeling that might arise over the capture and ransom of a prisoner , it was the prisoner 's right to tell the first version of her own downfall . She was entitled to make as much fun of her captor as she liked . Patarish Rois launched into a long preamble . It seemed to Daya that she was narrating all the raids she had ever been on , and acting them out complete with imitations of women involved — and , Daya thought at several points , of horses - to roars of appreciative laughter and comment . 368 Motherlines She would stick out her chunky rear and prance in a little circle , or stab her fingers through her wiry hair until it stood up on end . In one or two cases Daya could even see that she produced a creditable impression of someone present in the tent . Women were elbowing each other in the ribs and grinning . Then Patarish told how Alldera had felled her from the saddle . Silence and unbelieving stares . Alldera had said once that it was very unusual for a woman on foot to bring down a mounted one , let alone kick her down . The idea of a fem doing such a thing was plainly incomprehensible . Then Alldera moistened her mouth with tea and took her turn . The women listened intently . At the end , when she said that she would gladly demonstrate the exact kick she had used except that she had nearly crippled herself doing it the first time , there were some smiles . Someone got up and told a story about Alldera 's past among the Mares , something about a hunt . Other stories were told , branching out to feats of her '

The odors of unwashed leather and horse sweat , added to the stink of burning dung , made her feel queasy . She sucked at one of her scars where it bulged inside her cheek . She felt very tired , disturbed and put upon . It was a great relief to her when they were told that a special sweat tent had been prepared so the two of them could bathe in privacy . Much later , outside the sweat tent in the dusk , she and Alldera sluiced each other down with water from buckets left there for them . The sudden cool gush was remarkably pleasant and refreshing . The whole experience of the sweat tent had been unexpectedly agreeable . Watching Alldera drying off , Daya wondered idly what the Mares '

She followed the limping woman quietly out of the tent . There was a faint dawn pallor in the sky against which loomed the low , spreading shapes of the tents of Floating Moon Camp . The air was cold . Somewhere nearby a horse ruffled its breath loudly through its nostrils . Sheel embraced her heartmother and leaned her head against the weathered cheek , '

160735	160740	160723	160723	You	1019	' Sheel said acidly . '
160761	160788	160741	160742	My sharechild	4535	' By morning the dun horse had drifted back to the tent herd , having nowhere else to go . It was butchered with the others . '
160802	160821	160822	160822	He	4539	' Sheel said impatiently . She hated being fussed over in the middle of a game of pillo . '
160832	160839	160840	160840	She	0	're safe from him , Shayeen . '
160858	160882	160855	160855	Shayeen	377	' All the same , he 's got his hanger out . I wish you 'd ride a mare , like everyone else . '
160883	160890	160891	160891	Sheel	288	' Not in a pillo game , '
160894	160907	160891	160891	Sheel	288	' Have you seen the rump on that Faller woman 's horse ? '
160915	160935	160908	160908	She	0	' Imagine entering the game on a mare in season ! That 's why this stud is all excited . '
161138	161147	161127	161127	They	4545	' shoulders . Hidden behind these riders was the '
161149	161338	161127	161127	They	4545	' , a sheet of leather propped up on sticks like a tent . Sheel 's object was to ride through the opposition without losing the pillo , which she would try to sling into the mouth of the burrow and earn a goal . Each other rider would try to prevent her goal by pinning the pillo to earth with a well - placed lance thrust . Around Sheel friends and rivals laughed , called bets and counterbets , commented on the states of the horses and riders in this second half of play . Shayeen moved around the red horse , checking its gear and its feet . She need not have bothered ; nothing short of a broken leg would stop the stud , a five - year - old named Fire . Like other stallions , he was no use in a real race or a raid , either of which entailed a run of three days or so ; only the wiry little mares had that kind of endurance . For a day 's hunting or a pillo fight , he was superb . '
161345	161581	161127	161127	They	4545	' Sheel groaned . In the center of the field a dark woman of the Clarish line sat on her horse , lance raised straight in the air . From its end drooped a white horse tail . When the horse tail dropped the play would resume . She was looking from one end of the field to the other . The sky was overcast , presaging the end of the Dusty Season and the coming of rain . Over the distant mountains seams of sunlight opened in the dark , rich layers of cloud . Assured of new grass by a week of thunderous skies , the women had used the last of their precious grain to strengthen their fittest horses for the game . Sheel shivered in the breath of a breeze . She was wet with the sweat of anticipation . If fems were permitted in the game , there might now be femmish blood spilled by a woman of the Torrinor line . But pillo was a clean game , not for slaves from the lands of men . Kindred 389 The red horse snorted and mouthed the bit . He had gone four rounds already and his coat was dark with sweat . He jigged and fretted for the start of his run , one eye on the Faller 's high - tailed mare . The Clarish 's lance dipped . '
161584	161736	161737	161737	I	0	' the women screamed . Fire shot forward . Sheel lay along his neck , riding him with weight and legs . Her right arm yanked back the taut rope with the pillo bounding at the end of it , preparing a low , skimming whipstroke to catch the legs of the oncoming horses . The riders came like a dust storm , yelling and jostling , their lances cocked shoulder high to jab at the pillo . Sheel slung the pillo forward on its line , and the horses rushing toward her sprang aside . The red stud ignored the gap they left . He veered toward the Faller woman on her foam - streaked bay mare , fifteen meters down the field on the left . Sheel hauled on the reins and beat him over the shoulders with the knotted end of the rope . He would not turn . '
161742	161752	161753	161753	You	4550	' she screamed into his back - laid ears . '
161754	161764	161765	161766	The Faller	371	're dead as you run , sharu - vomit ! '
162210	162216	162217	162217	Sheel	288	' Sharu drink my blood ! '
162294	162328	162291	162291	Nenisi	297	' I hate that lumpy red horse of yours , but he is a pusher in a game - once you get him to concentrate on the business at hand , that is . '
162608	163398	162586	162586	She	290	' It was incredible ! The child had matured rapidly into a young adolescent . She seemed to Alldera rather stocky , certainly not tall . She had a wide , well - shaped mouth and her alert eyes looked everywhere , at everyone and everything . Sometimes she licked her lips , or clenched her hand on Barvaran 's so that her dirty knuckles paled . Alldera saw she was afraid , but there was no whimpering or shrinking . Alldera approved in an abstract way . This is the child of my body . At every tent women came out smiling to embrace the sharemothers , laughing , congratulating them , eyeing but not touching the child . Each clasped Alldera 's hands or stroked her shoulders or 392 Motherlines straightened her hair . Alldera was continually reminded of the day , years ago , when she had given birth among them . To this child . The sweat tent was not quite ready . The five sharemothers waited outside wrapped in their leather capes while other relatives — including free fems from the wagons , four of them now besides Daya - finished preparations for the ritual . Jesselee , as a grandmother , directed all this . Alldera could not stop yawning with nerves . Her belly rumbled , and her left side , where she had been hurt once in the tea camp , ached from the Rainy Season dampness . She looked at Nenisi standing close by , her face lit with joy . The child had come out late , a month after the pack mates of her generation , and she was small . She would not mate at this year 's Gather , or even next year 's . But she had come out , and Alldera could see the women 's relief and was glad of it . Now it was only required that this go well , that the gift to the women — to Nenisi , really , who wanted it so badly — be accomplished , whatever else might happen . As they went inside the sweat tent , Nenisi 's hand brushed Alldera 's and tightened briefly on her fingers . Scrapers had been laid out on a leather mat , fresh white slivers of soaproot gleamed , and the floor had been strewn with aromatic grasses . The sharemothers spread their leather capes on the floor and sat upon them , nude . The child crouched by Barvaran 's side . Her instant affinity for the red - faced woman meant that Barvaran would be her heartmother . Alldera felt relieved . For the moment there was no necessity of close contact between herself and the youngster , contact for which she felt totally unready in spite of all Nenisi 's preparations . Barvaran began to speak softly to the child in the quick , fluid slang of the childpack . Alldera felt a startling stab of jealousy . If she were to address the child in Holdfastish , there would be no understanding between them . Never mind , she thought ; what would I have to say to her ? She sat down near the stone pit , feeling the heat tighten her skin . Nenisi , squatting next to her , began pounding soaproot into paste . Cheerful Barvaran , handsome Shayeen whose reserve Alldera had never pierced , and Sheel , more wiry than ever and seeming very deliberate today , the family was gathered again . Naked , all but Nenisi and coppery Shayeen were pale - skinned except on their Kindred 393 hands and faces , which sun and wind had weathered . Alldera looked down at her own thighs - once brown from exposure below the short working garment of the fems , now pale from the protection of the pants she had adopted from the women — her own darkened hands resting on them . It amazed her to think that Sheel the raider , Sheel the fierce who rode stallions , killed men and hated fems , had once entered a tent like this as a child among her own mothers . But so had all the women . At the first hiss of steam from the stone pit the child shrank back into the enclosure of Barvaran 's arms . Gently , still speaking in a low voice , Barvaran scooped up a handful of lather and soaped the child 's shoulder while the others watched . The child glanced from one of them to another and back down at the shining film of soaproot that Barvaran spread with great tenderness on her skin . '
163405	163409	163399	163399	She	4585	' Shayeen commented , '
163418	163422	163423	163423	I	0	' Sheel said , '
163435	163436	163423	163423	I	0	' '
163442	163446	163423	163423	I	0	' Nenisi said . '
163462	163485	163453	163453	she	4585	' Barvaran held up one of the child 's arms and gently moved the hand in a circle with both of hers . '
163490	163496	163453	163453	she	4585	' she said with concern . '
163516	163577	163580	163580	she	4585	' The tricky part of the ritual bath was coming ; apparently all the youngsters fought against the discomforts of having their hair washed and untangled . Nenisi said that this was good : in her struggles to avoid her mothers a child learned that though they overpowered her , they did not harm her ; she could trust them . '
163590	163654	163580	163580	she	4585	' Shayeen predicted approvingly . Barvaran began lathering the child 's hair . In a moment the youngster let out a yell of outrage and tried to lunge away . The women rushed to help hold the slippery , thrashing limbs so that Barvaran could finish the hair wash . Alldera hung back , reluctant to lay hands on this strange young body . '
163658	163664	163674	163674	her	2927	' Shayeen shouted to her , '
163681	164410	163674	163674	her	2927	' 394 Motherlines Alldera thrust her own body among the bodies of the others . They were all dripping and lathered now . Helping to pinion the thin , flailing arms , Alldera kept her head pressed next to the child 's head to avoid being smacked in the face by her hard skull . Stinging soap had gotten into her eyes and she could not see , but she could feel the muscles pull and thrust under her grip , and she smelled the first blood flow which had led the childpack to expel the child . She kept remembering with disbelief that these straining limbs belonged to her own offspring . A douse of rinse water left them gasping and ready for the next stage . Barvaran blotted the child 's long , tangled hair in a blanket . The child still tried to pull away , abusing them all in pack slang . She yanked out her menstrual plug twice before Barvaran could get her to accept its presence in her body . Barvaran sat with her , grooming her sleek hair and talking quietly in her ear while the other sharemothers washed their own hair and scraped each other down . They showed off to one another the red marks where the child had hit them and ruefully compared bruises . The entryway was tightly laced . Alldera saw how the child 's eyes kept flashing in that direction ; she no longer fought back , but she had not given up . Alldera thought , this child would never have lived to come out of the Holdfast kit pits . The older fems would have judged her too ready to fight . Before she could break some man 's teeth for him and bring a flood of femmish blood in reprisal , we would have killed her ourselves . An ordinary idea , in my old life . The child watched each of the adults warily . For an instant her eyes met Alldera 's . There was no spark of special feeling . She seemed rather ordinary now , a draggled youngster , hair dark with moisture , skin dark with years of running naked , flickering eyes of an indeterminate color in the silvery light of the sweat tent ; hazel , Shayeen had said . Alldera looked away . What came next would exclude her because she was not a Riding Woman . Nenisi had prepared her . She withdrew to watch and sat with her back against one of the tent poles . The others rose to their feet and stood in a group near the stone pit , leaving the child apart for a moment . Something very small and simple happened . The child jumped up Kindred 395 and glanced quickly at the entry ; as she did so , the women turned their heads toward her . That was all , but there was something in the carriage of their heads , the wideness of their eyes . They seemed to Alldera to mimic with extraordinary power the way that horses lift their heads from grazing to look and listen . Then Sheel squatted , and moving backwards on her haunches she began to smooth the sand outward from the pit toward the sweat tent wall behind her . Time had touched her , Alldera saw ; veins and tendons stood high under the skin of her forearms and hands . Nenisi and Shayeen did as Sheel did , palming the sand flat . Barvaran stood with a hand on the child 's shoulder and still talked to her , pointing , smiling , as the smoothed sand was marked by the others with lines , dots , circles , zig - zags , all oriented to the stone pit , which symbolized the present campsite of Stone Dancing . This was how women gave a child the plains . As heartmother , Barvaran took the first turn , leading the reluctant youngster about the tent by the hand . The other women walked in attendance as Barvaran named all the places that were special to her , places mapped by the markings on the floor . She walked the child over their world ; all heads bent to follow Barvaran 's stubby , pointing finger : '
164415	164421	163674	163674	her	2927	' Alldera heard her murmur , '
164452	164467	164471	164471	you	4590	' There could be no turn for Alldera in this , Nenisi had said ; '
164489	164531	164471	164471	you	4590	' Nenisi came out of the group and sat by Alldera at the tent wall . With the back of her hand she pushed aside the hair plastered to her gleaming black forehead . Her eyes were on the other women . '
164547	164564	164565	164565	I	0	' she said . Alldera thought of that moment of magic when their heads had turned . '
164569	164570	164565	164565	I	0	' '
164573	164578	164471	164471	you	4590	' Nenisi hugged her . '
164659	165240	165243	165243	Alldera	377	' Alldera did not say aloud , Are not the men and fems beyond the 396 Motherlines mountains elements of the world ? She did not want to disrupt the ceremony or the triumphant mood of Nenisi , whom she loved . Then it was Nenisi 's turn to take the child walking over the world . Alldera sat back , thinking . She recalled Nenisi 's joy at her return , months back now , and her own almost sensuous delight at what had taken on the color of a true homecoming , so familiar had everything seemed . Coming from her years away with the free fems , she had at once noticed the changes that only a woman of Stone Dancing Camp would notice : this person gone , these horses newly arrived or newborn , such and such a family richer than before while another once prosperous group used other women 's cast - off tent leathers and awaited its turn of luck . Rayoratan Tent had gone , having packed up after a quarrel with the Shawden chiefs and joined Waterwall Camp in the north . Shan the bow - maker who had made Alldera 's first bow was dead , carried off by a bout of lung fever . When Alldera expressed her shock and even a touch of real sorrow , the women nodded and patted her just as if she were one of them and had a right to mourn . She was no longer trying to catch up with them . Their distance from her — when she felt it — was now simply part of their nature and their beauty . She found that she did not need Daya to remind her of who she was . From the first the little pet had been much more than a shadowy companion . She had become a teacher of other fems and lover of Grays Omelly , of all women ! Alldera knew she had underestimated the pet fem . She had asked Daya to come as a companion of her own kind , thinking it could make no difference to the women . The effect that Daya made among them delighted her . Despite the women 's low opinion of free fems , the little pet 's grace , her elegant manners , her beautiful marred face as serious and watchful as an animal 's , intrigued them . Also , they could not hide their startled admiration of her skill with horses . Alldera had never considered the free fems who admired Daya and who would be attracted and reassured by tales of her presence here . Four had come , and maybe there would be others . Their presence made Alldera uneasy . They brought friction . There was their inveterate stealing , their pathetic arrogance , their clannishness . And Daya 's affair with Grays Kindred 397 Omelly — how long before other free fems moved into the beds of other women , with what consequences ? Fems were intense and jealous lovers , totally opposite to the casual behavior of women . They insisted on wearing sandals , chewed tea instead of drinking it , spat everywhere in a way that the women found offensive . . . So many irritating matters , so difficult to cope with and to explain . Even Nenisi did not fully understand ; and there was an aspect of the fems '
165570	165581	165582	165583	the girl	4618	' Is my nose flat in the middle like yours ? '
165606	165609	165582	165583	the girl	4618	' No . '
165622	165632	165613	165613	She	377	' You 'll be better looking than I am . '
165642	165645	165633	165634	The youngster	8681	' But we 're
165659	165851	165647	165649	Motherlines blood kin	4621	' Alldera found that she could not now remember the face of either of the two men who might have been this child 's father . Jesselee , in charge of the coming - out arrangements , did not alter the traditions in any way for this unique child . There was feasting , dancing on the dance ground , gift giving , and gift acceptance , all centered on the child and her introduction to the women of other tents . These ceremonies involved the rest of the family , but not the bloodmother . The bloodmother always tended the tent herd . The effect was to insulate the bloodmother and the child from each other . The bloodmother looked at her child and saw her own image made young , her replacement in the world , Nenisi said . The child saw in her bloodmother the pattern for her own being . Women said it was best not to let this powerful connection unbalance all the other relationships that guided their two lives , and so it was appropriate that the bloodmother and child be separated for a time . '
165856	165886	165647	165649	Motherlines blood kin	4621	' Daya said , riding with Alldera on the second morning after the coming out . Daya had brought a flask of blood broth from which Alldera drank gratefully . '

166150	166157	166158	166158	Daya	305	' How about " Tezera " ? '
166162	166169	166170	166170	She	305	' That 's a pretty name . '

166224	166235	166170	166170	She	305	' Is that what they say at the trade wagon ? '
166236	166239	166240	166240	Daya	305	' Yes , '
166243	166280	166240	166240	Daya	305	' They think she should have a femmish name , ending in " a " . We 've all kept our slave names , in respect for our past . And she was conceived back there . '
166284	166326	166327	166327	She	377	' A femmish name would n't make any difference . The women would just drop the " a " , since to them she 's a woman , not a fem — unlike ourselves , who wobble along somewhere in between . '
166341	166372	166336	166336	Daya	305	' Some fems are saying that we should insist on taking the child and dedicating her to Moonwoman . They 'd be furious if they knew I 'd told you . '
166373	166385	166476	166476	She	377	' Why do they care about her all of a sudden ? '
166386	166411	166412	166412	Daya	305	' You know many fems in the tea camp thought from the beginning that you were wrong to leave the cub with the Mares , '

166456	166467	166468	166468	Alldera	377	' The fems talk as if I owe them something . '
166480	166501	166476	166476	She	377	' What about you ? Do you believe I owe you and Fedeka and the rest of the wagon fems ? '
166502	166526	166412	166412	Daya	305	' No ; but I think that we do need , for our own sakes , to make a claim on that cub . '

Did n't Fedeka understand that Alldera 's turn to sing would come later ? Was she infuriated by the child 's non - femmish name ? With relief Alldera saw that Daya was sidling into the tent at Fedeka 's back . She would appeal to Daya for support ; but then Fedeka shouted , '
167590	167652	167586	167586	our	4669	' and opened her mouth wide and wailed out a verse : The greedy whip scorches , the load burns me down , the eyes of my master are everywhere . 402 Motherlines My lover has fled , I will not pursue her .

Alldera came because she could not stand the angry looks of the women , and she did not want to be alone tonight . The naming of the child had made her feel old and unimportant . She needed to find out how the free fems would greet her . They made room for her without fuss , and she sat down with weary relief amid the tea - scented bundles of trade goods and the rolls of bedding of the crew . The atmosphere in the wagon was vibrant with victory . From their triumphant glances at her she guessed they felt they had repossessed not only the child but its mother . Daya was telling an ugly Holdfast story about a man who betrayed his lover and how his lover killed him with a whip and ran his flayed skin up the flagpole of their company hall next morning . '

Alldera listened with her head bowed , for she knew they did not see what she did : the vast rift between these cherished memories and the songs of pain they had sung for Sorrel . The fems '

She shared only the anguish of their bitter songs . What are we , here ? Alldera thought , looking around at the rapt , firelit faces . Outsiders , eking out a living at trading , which women must have handled perfectly well for themselves before free fems ever came here . The women do n't need us , there is no next generation of fems that need us , we do n't need ourselves . If we vanished tonight , whisked away like dream people , who would miss us ? Someone was absent from the gathering , the one fem who had always seemed to her to belong to the Grasslands . Leaning nearer to Tua , Alldera murmured , '

The free fems try to storm Bayo town , but the men have fire throwers and dart throwers and slings , and the fems run out of arrows . Kobba and her troop are driven back into the swamp , up to their thighs in water , struggling southward through the sucking mud among the reeds and the roots . In the night they hear the prisoner fems singing , calling for help as we all used to speak to each other in songs . '

She refuses to die or be caught . She eats roots , she drinks marsh water and does n't let sickness slow her down . She forces herself on even when the swamp is silent and she knows the men no longer follow . She thinks she has caught the smell of smoke . She finds a broken sandal strap . One day she stumbles onto the shore of a huge island in the marsh , where reeds give way to trees . Someone is watching there - a 406 Motherlines fem , scar - backed , solid , one of those who slipped away from Bayo and hid in the swamp . There are many others with her . '
169626	169701	169702	169702	We	4738	' The swamp fems welcome Kobba . They say they thought all the fems of the Holdfast were dead , for none have slipped out to join them in a long time . But Kobba tells them , Come and help me , the men still hold Bayo and twenty of our kind prisoners there , many of them pregnant with cubs we need . This time we will surely batter through the walls . '
169794	169864	169788	169788	they	623	' The creatures swim along the channels of the swamp and find the men and fasten onto their feet and legs , flooding their bodies with poison . The men die loudly . They have no discipline , they scream and cry and flounder in the water , they beg to be saved . The fems listen from hiding . They want to laugh , but they stay silent . '
169912	169952	169953	169953	We	4748	' The fems still do not laugh . They hug Kobba , but silently . They will not laugh , they will not triumph , until the prisoners are rescued - and that 's another story for tomorrow evening . '

They are sure of me now , and they want me to teach them fighting and riding so they can Kindred 407 invade the Holdfast like women going to war - that 's the fantasy Day a has woven for them with her stories ! Fems have always learned what they needed to survive . They could learn to ride and shoot , not like women who 've done those things all their lives , but well enough . But what would they be once they learned ? They 'd still be no stronger than I am , no more skilled or brave , just people like me - not witches armed with killing spells . We 'd be a pathetic little band , desperate fems trusting to tools only recently come into our hands , keeping each other 's courage up with stories and lies . It 's impossible . But suppose we did it : went back , found the Holdfast in ruins but some men alive , took it all over , made it ours . How many of us are fit to bear a new generation ? How many captured men would be young enough to father healthy cubs ? Would we all want to bear cubs if we could ? They envision taking over the masters '

Alldera thought again of bringing up the whole Kindred 409 question of going back to the Holdfast ; the other fems had dropped back a little . But the fact was , Alldera could not seem to get it straight enough in her own mind to discuss , even when an opportunity came . Daya said . '

172180	172381	172178	172178	you	377	' In some years vast numbers of sharu swarmed over the plain devouring everything . They could overrun a camp and consume food , grain , leather gear , even tethered horses or women immobilized by accident or illness . They ravaged the grazing land , gnawing the grass down to the subsoil and scattering the women 's herds beyond retrieval for months after . Sorrel , Barvaran and Sheel came back from their hunting with reports of large bands of sharu traveling roughly east to west toward the Great Salty River , on a path which would bring them across the Stone Dancing lands . Stone Dancing Camp became a moving war center against the sharu . Groups of women ranged in all directions , each rider armed with two bows and several quivers of arrows , to destroy or deflect any sharu hordes they could find a day 's ride from camp . The free fems wanted to join the hunt . Alldera explained that fems would be more useful taking over camp duties so that more women could go after sharu . There was no argument against her advice . Daya simply came to her and said , '

172528	172536	172515	172515	Alldera	377	' What am I supposed to do ? '
172544	172561	172541	172541	Alldera	377	' Tell Tua and the others to meet me out by the herds in the morning . '

172809	173004	173052	173052	Alldera	377	' were transformed into useful allies . Sorrel came clamoring to her mothers to be allowed a part in the killing , saying that if even her bloodmother 's cousins were involved , she could surely be . It made Alldera uncomfortable to think of this handsome youngster , with her alert , quick - smiling face and beautiful hair , at risk among the sharu . There was risk . A woman of the Shawden tent fell from her horse when her girth strap broke ; she was torn apart by sharu before she could be picked up . Another , her arrows spent , met a sharu 's charge with her lance . The sharu took the point in its breast and kept coming , impaling itself but ripping her knee with his teeth and claws as it died . Kindred 413 Alldera did not have to speak against Sorrel 's pleas . The women in the tent said firmly that Sorrel might help with weapons , childpack , horses , or with any work in the camp , and perhaps in emergencies she might run messages ; but that was all . '
173014	173018	173052	173052	Alldera	377	' Jesselee said . '
173025	173029	173030	173030	I	0	' Sorrel objected . '

173269	173371	173372	173372	Sorrel	387	' A big sharu jumped on her horse 's rump and raked her down the back . She had an arrow in her hand , and she jabbed the point right into the sharu 's eye and killed it . They say they found her bent down from her saddle , streaming blood , trying to work the arrow back out of the eye socket , but the barb had caught , and Tico says it was the coolest thing she ever saw , but Daya was weeping and screaming the whole time and kept throwing up all the way back . '
173407	173413	173414	173414	Alldera	377	' Thanks for the message , '
173417	173422	173414	173414	Alldera	377	' Now go back . '

I own my clothing , my saddle , a few ornaments , and the knife on my belt . Oh , and that gray horse the tent gave me to make up for butchering my dun .

She had put on muscle and weight since coming out , but she was no match for a crowd of her pack mates . The tent was quiet . Guests had come , a daughter of Barvaran 's traveling with a couple of cousins .

The newly arrived fems studied horses and the bow so hard with Alldera and Daya that women joked about how they must be meaning to make Riding Women of themselves . They had given up their ungainly wagons and now had their own fem tent pitched next to Holdfaster Tent . Even Sheel , unwilling as she was , had to admit to herself that the longer they lived here in the camp the more their slavish ways fell away from them . Everyone noticed that they all quarreled and intrigued far less among themselves than they had when they had been only a handful . With women , their manner was no longer brashly alien , but guarded and self - contained . Except for Alldera , they chose their lovers only among their own ranks now ; even Daya did . '

179092	179165	179071	179071	Sorrel	387	' Covertly Sheel studied Alldera 's face . No humor there ; hardness and hostility showed in the set of the wide mouth . No wonder ; Sorrel knew in her blood and bones from her earliest life so much that these clumsy , thick - headed outlanders were laboring to grasp . The youngster would make a better teacher than her bloodmother , if she were patient enough to command the fems '
179232	179244	179245	179245	Sorrel	387	' You tap the foot lightly all around with a stone , '

Everyone was stunned : who could have imagined Barvaran , red - faced and crude and good - hearted , caught up somehow in Nenisi 's quarrel with the Perikens and rushing into a duel on the dancing ground ? Returning from a ride to check the location of the next campsite , Alldera found the Holdfaster women assembled by Barvaran 's bedding . Barvaran lay gasping , her mouth frothing blood . There was a wound in her chest that opened with every breath she drew . The woman who had struck her had fled to seek refuge with relatives in another camp . Barvaran was dead by morning . They took her body , lashed limply over the back of a horse , to abandon it in the grass far from camp . They laid the body down , washed clean and clothed , and they left it for the sharu . That was all . Women did not speak over corpses . Their farewells had been taken during the night , while Barvaran 's spirit still lived and struggled . Shayeen said , '
180215	180287	180205	180213	which well - loved woman of the guilty line	5006	' Sorrel argued furiously with Jesselee all the way back to the camp and wept and insisted she was going to find the killer and cut her throat . She lashed her horse into erratic bursts of speed and blood ied its mouth with her wrenching on the reins until Sheel rode up , yanked her from the saddle , and set her on her feet on the ground . Epilogue 433 '
180295	180299	180205	180213	which well - loved woman of the guilty line	5006	' Sheel said . '
180314	180797	180798	180798	You	5010	' The youngster hugged her mare around the neck , remounted , and on a slack rein let herself be carried homeward , crying bitterly . Alldera trailed behind them , wondering what would be good to say to comfort Sorrel ; thinking that it was better the fems had stayed behind rather than coming along to criticize the women 's death customs ; thinking most of all of Barvaran 's red face looming above her in a gully in the desert years ago before Sorrel was born , the way Barvaran 's breast had yielded under her hand , that first touch of a Riding Woman , that first amazement . . . Who would have thought that Barvaran and I would live together as members of a family ? My family , the family of my child that I brought to them , gave to them . Shared , she thought suddenly ; I shared her with my sharemothers . One part of Sorrel is n't given and ca n't be — my share . I really did it . I was no mother , I did n't know how to become one — I was just a Holdfast dam . But I got her away from the men and I found her a whole family of mothers , and saw her into her free life as a young woman . Not that I set out to do it , and it 's not all I 've done on this side of the mountains , but it 's done . She looked at the dejected figure of Sorrel up ahead . Will she ever realize , and thank me for it ? Not that a family is forever , your mothers leave you — Barvaran , maybe Jesselee , myself , soon . Still , it 's something . What 's she going to be like , I wonder ? I 'll come back and find out , if I can . Nenisi rode up alongside Alldera . Strapped to the bridge of her nose she wore a wooden mask with a slit across the center , used for protecting the sight from flying stone slivers when chipping flint . Now it protected her swollen eyes from the sun and the wind . Along the hard ground flickers of light seemed to dance : leaves from a brush bank , curled and dry , were being driven in skipping circles by cool eddies of air . The sky was half skinned over with high white clouds , against which there floated smaller cloud puffs of exquisitely modulated grays and silvers . To the south the sky was clear , a blue of burning intensity in which these same subtly shaped and tinted clouds hung with a melting softness , sweet to Alldera 's eye . 434 Motherlines Nenisi said abruptly , '
180803	180804	180798	180798	You	5010	' '
180807	180813	180798	180798	You	5010	' That was a lie . '
180820	180834	180814	180814	I	0	' The truth . Nenisi went on as if Alldera had not spoken : '
180893	180964	180966	180966	me	0	' Now that relationship has changed . The free fems are kindred of the camps and free to go where they like — and I 'll say so , as a Conor , when the question arises whether we should let you all return across the borderlands . But women like Sheel may charge that I can no longer speak as a Conor in this matter because of my feelings . '
181001	181054	181055	181055	You	5018	' Alldera fixed her eyes on the steadying sight of her own hands clasped one over the other on the peak of her saddle , as she groped for a response . Nenisi turned toward her , her smooth black face masked , red lipped where the wind had bitten her mouth . '
181164	181197	181200	181200	Alldera	377	' Making love is much the same for all , but each person speaks only her own words . I have few of your words from days past to keep with me . '
181232	181260	181229	181229	She	0	' I thought you had so much trouble already - your eyes , and this cursed Periken feud — look , Nenisi , nothing is certain yet . '
181311	181315	181308	181308	She	0	' Nenisi , you 're
181332	181338	181316	181317	a Conor	9575	' Nenisi shook her head . '
181423	181507	181407	181408	Many women	4423	' And as you know , there are women of Stone Dancing Camp who would cheer to see you and your people leave our tents , no matter what the long - range risk . Women of my Motherline want you gone for my sake — they see that your otherness , your singleness , has captured me , and they worry that I have become a stranger to my own . It frightens them that we are so close for so long . '
181546	181574	181520	181520	She	387	' Everything that matters ! Alldera drew her headcloth closer around her shoulders , too dismal to speak . Nenisi glanced back the way they had come . '
181588	181592	181576	181576	we	5043	' she said . '
181690	181694	181713	181713	Alldera	377	're always right . '
