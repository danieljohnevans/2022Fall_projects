3195	3331	3175	3175	she	923	" IO Mary Doria Russell black - and - silver hair spilling forward over high Taino cheekbones as he admired the little animal Celestina dumped in his lap . It had taken four priests eight months of relentless pressure to get Emilio Sandoz to reveal what Celestina had learned in two minutes . Evi- . dently , the Father General observed wryly , the best man for the job can sometimes be a four - year - old girl . And he wished that Edward Behr had stayed to see this . BROTHER EDWARD WAS AT THAT MOMENT IN HIS ROOM IN THE JESUITS ' Neapolitan retreat house some four kilometers away , still astounded that the Father General had chosen a baptism as the occasion for Emilio Sandoz 's first venture out of seclusion . “
3336	3343	3332	3332	You	928	” Edward had cried that morning . “

3446	3447	3442	3442	you	280	” “
3461	3816	3459	3459	Edward	256	” the Father General said , smiling mildly . And that was that . Having dropped the two priests off at the church , Brother Edward spent the remainder of the day back at the Jesuit house , stewing . By three in the afternoon , he had convinced himself that he really ought to leave early to fetch them back from the party . It was only sensible to allow time for security checks , he told himself . Regardless of how well known the driver was , no vehicle got near Giuliani real estate or the retreat without being carefully and repeatedly considered by swarthy , suspicious men and large , thoughtful dogs trained to detect explosives and ill will . So Edward allowed forty - five minutes for a trip that might otherwise take ten , and was questioned and sniffed and inspected at every intersection of the road that paralleled the coast . It was n't entirely wasted time , he noted , as the car 's undercarriage was mirrored at the compound gate and his identification studied a fourth time . He had , for example , learned some remarkable things from several dogs about where weapons might theoretically be concealed on a tubby man 's body . However questionable the probity of the Father General 's Neapolitan . CHILDREN OF GOD II a relatives , it was a comfort to know that Emilio Sandoz benefited from their thoroughness , and Edward was eventually allowed to pull into the driveway of the largest of the several houses visible from the front gate , its loggia festive with flowers and balloons . Emilio was nowhere to be seen , but before long , the Father General separated from a little crowd with a young blond woman . Giuliani raised a hand in acknowledgment to Behr and then spoke to someone in the house . Emilio appeared moments later , looking stiff - backed and exhausted , a dark amalgam of Indian endurance and Spanish pride . There was a small girl in a very rumpled party dress at his side . “
3821	3826	3459	3459	Edward	256	” Edward muttered furiously . “
3832	3951	3459	3459	Edward	256	” With as fortifyingly deep a breath as an asthmatic could manage , Brother Edward heaved his portly self out of the car and trundled around it , opening doors for the Father General and for Sandoz , while Giuliani made their good - byes to the hostess and the other guests . The little girl said something , and Edward groaned when Emilio knelt to receive her embrace and return the hug as best he could . Despite — no , because of the tenderness of that farewell , Brother Edward was not a bit surprised by the quiet conversation that was going on between the two priests as they made their way alone to the car . "

4159	4222	4123	4123	You	933	” Edward , wincing at the language , glanced into the rearview mirror when Emilio 's voice broke . Cry , Edward thought . It 's better than the headaches . Go ahead and cry . But Sandoz fell silent and stared out the window at the passing countryside , dry - eyed and furious . 9 » I2 Mary Doria Russell > “

4391	4612	4613	4613	Emilio	261	" Brother Edward turned left onto the coast road , seeing through Emilio 's desperate bluff , marveling at the relationship between these two men . Born to wealth and unquestioned privilege , Vincenzo Giuliani was a historian and politician of international repute , still powerful in body and mind at the age of seventy - nine . Emilio Sandoz was the illegitimate child of a Puerto Rican woman who 'd had an affair while her husband was jailed for trafficking in the very substances that had enriched an earlier generation of La Famiglia Giuliani . The two men had met over sixty years ago while studying for the priesthood . And yet , Sandoz was now only forty - six years old , give or take a bit . One of the many bizarre aspects of Emilio 's situation was the fact that he 'd spent thirty - four years traveling at a substantial percentage of the speed of light , to and from the Alpha Centauri system . For Sandoz , only about six years had gone by since he 'd left Earth — difficult years , granted , but very few of them compared to those that had passed for Vince Giuliani , now decades Emilio 's senior and his superior by several levels of Jesuit organization .

6303	6476	6299	6299	he	829	“ for your kind inquiry regarding the health and status of Emilio Sandoz . During the year since returning to Earth from Rakhat in September 2059 , Father Sandoz has recovered from scurvy and anemia , but remains frail and emotionally volatile . As you know from media reports leaked last year by personnel at the Salvator Mundi Hospital in Rome , the muscles between the bones of his palms were stripped away on Rakhat , doubling the length of his fingers and rendering them useless . Sandoz himself does not fully understand why he was deliberately maimed ; it was not intended as torture , although that is certainly what it has amounted to . He believes that the procedure marked him as the dependent or , perhaps , the property of a man named Supaari VaGayjur , about whom more later . Father Sandoz has been fitted with external bioactive braces ; he has worked very hard to achieve limited dexterity , and can now manage most self - care . ”
6548	6557	6533	6533	He	829	" In the view of his mission superiors , ”
6561	6647	6533	6533	He	829	“ Emilio Sandoz was responsible for much of the early success of first contact . His extraordinary skill and stamina as an interpreter aided all the other members of the Stella Maris party in their research , and his personal charm won them many friends among the VaRakhati . Moreover , the evident beauty of his spiritual state during the early years of the mission restored the faith of at least one lay member of the crew , and enriched that of his brother priests . "
6808	6905	6775	6776	Supaari VaGayjur	286	“ Thus , of the eighteen people who traveled to Rakhat in two separate parties , only Emilio Sandoz has survived . Father Sandoz has cooperated with us to the best of his ability during months of intense questioning , often at the cost of great personal distress . I will provide Your Holiness with a complete set of the mission 's scientific papers and supporting documents , as well as verbatim transcripts of the hearings ; here , for your consideration , is a brief outline of salient points uncovered during the hearings just concluded . “
6919	6950	6951	6951	People	950	“ The Stella Maris party was initially welcomed as a ' foreign ' trade delegation by the village of Kashan . The villagers identified themselves as Runa , which simply means “
6993	7132	6986	6986	they	429	“ Their hands are double - thumbed and their craftsmanship is superb , but some members of the Jesuit party suspected that the Runa in general were somewhat limited intellectually . Their material culture seemed too simple to account for the powerful transmissions first detected on Earth by radio telescope in 2019 . Furthermore , the Runa were disturbed and frightened by music , which seemed anomalous , given that it was radio broadcasts of chorales that first alerted us to the existence of Rakhat . However , individual Runa seemed quite bright , and the tentative conclusion was that the village of Kashan was something of a backwater on the edge of a sophisticated civilization . Since there was so much to be learned in Kashan , the decision was made to remain there for a time . “
7251	7321	7203	7204	Supaari VaGayjur	286	“ The Jesuit party had every reason to believe Supaari was a man of goodwill . If anything , their relationship with the Runa villagers was improved by Supaari 's intervention and aid , and Sandoz attributes much of his own understanding of Rakhat 's civilization to Supaari 's patient explanations . Supaari 's gross betrayal of Sandoz 's trust remains one of the great puzzles of the mission . “
7333	7397	7203	7204	Supaari VaGayjur	286	“ The Runa are the hands of the Jana’ata : the skilled trades , the domestic staffs and laborers , even the civil service . But the differences in status between the Jana'ata and Runa are not merely those of class , as our people believed . The Runa are essentially domesticated animals — the Jana'ata breed them , as we breed dogs . “
7490	7619	7461	7462	the Jana’ata	291	“ The core values of Jana'ata society are stewardship and stability , and in keeping with this , the Jana'ata also limit their own reproduction , maintaining their numbers at approximately 4 percent of the overall Runa population . Strict lines of inheritance rule a largely ceremonial life , and only the first two children of any breeding Jana'ata couple may themselves marry and reproduce . If later - born adults decline to be neutered , they are permitted to have sex with Runa concubines , since cross - species sex carries no risk of unsanctioned reproduction . Jana’ata thirds are most commonly involved in commerce , scholarship and , evidently , prostitution . In this context , it should be noted that Supaari VaGayjur was a third . “
7656	7737	7653	7654	Your Holiness	5330	” It was there that Giuliani had stopped the night before , listening for a time to the sound of Sandoz 's footsteps above him . Five steps , pause ; five steps , pause . At least when Emilio was pacing , one could be certain that CHILDREN OF GOD 19 he had not yet added his own life to the toll taken by the mission to Rakhat . .. . Sighing , Giuliani now returned to his task . “
7750	7794	7795	7795	Your	1037	" When Runa adults have raised their own children to the age of reproduction , the parents voluntarily give themselves up to Jana'ata patrols , who periodically round up such older adults and any substandard infants , all of whom are then butchered . "
7954	7975	7999	8000	Emilio Sandoz	261	” The Father General sat back in his chair . And now , he thought , the worst of it . “
7982	7987	7999	8000	Emilio Sandoz	261	" Giuliani began again , “
8083	8209	8212	8214	the Father General	829	" When Supaari VaGayjur learned of their arrest , he tracked the two priests down and evidently bribed the patrol 's commander , thus obtaining custody of them . Once in Supaari 's compound , Sandoz was asked if he and Robichaux were willing to‘accept hasta'akala . ' Sandoz believed they were being offered hospitality and agreed . To his horror , his hands and those of Father Robichaux were promptly destroyed ; Robichaux bled to death as a result . Approximately eight months later , Supaari VaGayjur sold Sandoz to a Jana'ata aristocrat named Hlavin Kitheri . I hope that Your Holiness 20 Mary Doria Russell can not imagine the brutality of the treatment to which Sandoz was subject while in Kitheri 's possession . ”

8251	8261	8245	8245	Emilio	261	“ I am God 's whore , and ruined . ”
8317	8445	8306	8306	he	262	“ Months later , when the Magellan arrived in orbit around Rakhat , members of the Contact Consortium boarded the derelict Stella Maris and accessed records of the first two years of our mission . The entire Jesuit party was missing and presumed dead . The Magellan party made landfall near the village of Kashan , and were greeted with hostility and fear , in stark contrast to the welcome the Stella Maris party had received . A young Runa female named Askama told them in English that Emilio Sandoz was still alive and residing with Supaari VaGayjur in the city of Gayjur . Hoping for guidance from Sandoz , the Magellan party was taken to that city by Askama , who was clearly devoted to Sandoz . “
8538	8664	8527	8527	he	286	" Several weeks later , Askama had located Sandoz herself , and took the ranking members of the Magellan party to him . He was found in Hlavin Kitheri 's seraglio , naked except for a jeweled collar and perfumed ribbons , the bloody effects of sodomy visible . By his own admission , Sandoz had by that time reached a state of murderous desperation . Hoping to prove himself so dangerous that he would either be left alone or executed , he had that day made Jephthah 's vow : that he would kill the next person he He could not have anticipated that it would be Askama , a Runa child whom he had all but raised , and whom he loved deeply . "
8759	9267	8749	8751	the Magellan party	1012	" As was I , Vincenzo Giuliani thought , standing once more and walking away from his desk . It was absurd in hindsight — the very idea that a handful of humans might have been able to do everything right the first time . Even the closest of friends can misunderstand one another , he reminded himself . First contact — by definition — takes place in a state of radical ignorance , where nothing is known about the ecology , biology , languages , culture and economy of the Other . On Rakhat , that ignorance proved catastrophic . You could n't have known , Vincenzo Giuliani thought , hearing his own pacing , but remembering Emilio 's . It was n't your fault . Tell that to the dead , Emilio would have answered . 2 Trucha Sai , Rakhat 2042 , Earth - Relative a SOFIA MENDES HAD KNOWN FROM THE VERY START THAT THE MEMBERS of the Jesuit mission to Rakhat would be an endangered species on that planet . The Stella Maris had begun with a crew of eight . Alan Pace died within weeks of landfall , and then they were seven . D. W. Yarbrough , the Jesuit superior , became ill a few months later and never recovered , although he survived an additional eighteen months , in declining health . Understandably , having no research facilities and no colleagues , the physician Anne Edwards was never able to understand either illness , although her care undoubtedly prolonged D.W. 's life . Later , Anne herself was killed , along with D.W. , and their deaths were a staggering blow to the tiny band they left behind . In the face of misfortune , the Jesuit party had rallied repeatedly . When a simple miscalculation in the aftermath of a serious accident resulted in the crew being marooned on Rakhat , they had adapted , establishing a garden to supply themselves with food , becoming part of the local economy by providing exotic trade goods . They were accepted by the villagers of Kashan , even to the point of being called by kinship terms by many families . And there were times of great joy , most notably Sofia 's own wedding to Jimmy Quinn , and the announcement that they were awaiting a birth - just before it all went wrong . a CHILDREN OF GOD 23 Like so many Jewish children , Sofia Mendes had grown up with nightmare images of Egyptian slavemasters , of Babylonians and Assyrians and Romans , of Cossacks and inquisitors , and the SS coming to kill ; she had vanquished a child 's intense , impotent fear by imagining herself fighting back , repulsing would be conquerors . So when the Jana’ata patrol had arrived at Kashan and burned the foreign garden and demanded that the VaKashani Runa bring their babies forward and then , systematically , began to kill the children , Sofia Mendes had acted without hesitation . “
9276	9296	9297	9297	We	1063	” she called out to the VaKashani and lifted a Runa infant to breasts swollen with her own pregnancy . “
9299	9548	9297	9297	We	1063	” she said , and cast her fate with the Runa — with the untermenschen of Rakhat . Her gesture , briefly , turned the tide ; her own fall , under the bludgeoning sweep of a Jana'ata arm , stiffened the resistance . Then , believing that they could not win , Runa fathers fell over children to shield them with their bodies ; Runa mothers sacrificed themselves to Jana'ata fury , absorbing the violence to save the rest . When it was over , there were scores of carcasses , heaped and bloody , most of which were quickly butchered . When the patrol left , terror and the unprecedented exhilaration of momentary triumph made consensus impossible . The village of Kashan had fissioned , in violation of the most basic Runa strategies for survival : stay together ; circle to protect the greatest number ; act in concert . Close to panic , individuals searched for anyone who shared some identifiable emotion , forming small , less vulnerable clusters as quickly as possible . Those whose families had been killed added sinuous scented ribbons to their arms and necks , too stunned to react . Most did little more than hope life would return to normal , now that all the foreigners except Sofia were gone and most of the illegal babies dead . Their impulse was to hand Sofia over to the Jana'ata government as proof that Kashan was once again within the law . “
9555	9559	9297	9297	We	1063	” they cried . “
9572	9603	9567	9568	The djanada	1066	" a girl named Djalao countered . Barely grown , she had no authority , but in the confusion , there were those so hungry for direction that they listened . “
9619	9631	9632	9634	The djanada patrols	1069	” Djalao told the runners in the aftermath of the massacre . “
9654	10015	10016	10017	Trucha Sai	310	” Kanchay VaKashan was as confused as anyone , but it was his daughter Puska whom Sofia had saved , and he was grateful . So when a handful of 24 Mary Doria Russell men with surviving infants decided to wait until redlight and flee to the safety of the southern forest , he took Sofia as well . Of their journey to sanctuary , Sofia herself remembered only the occasional thin keening of Runa infants ; the swaying , fluid stride of Kanchay , who carried her on his back for days ; the sounds of savannah changing to forest . At first , her face hurt so much she could not open her mouth , so Kanchay reduced food to a paste for her and mixed it with rainwater , drizzling this gruel through her clenched teeth . She took as much nourishment as she could that way . The child , she thought . The child needs it . Bled white , stupid with pain , she concentrated on her own baby , who was not yet lost to her like all the other people she had dared to love . She focused her life 's blood on her center , where the child still lived , and felt each vague fetal movement as fear , each strong kick as hope . She slept heavily in the beginning and even later dozed a great deal , warmed by three suns ' light filtering through the forest canopy . When awake , she lay still , listening to the rhythmic , rasping slide of long , tough leaves the shape of samurai swords — bent and woven , bent and wovenas the Runa settled into a clearing made efficiently beautiful with sleeping platforms and windscreens . Nearby she heard the splash of creek water tumbling over smooth stones . Above , the booming groans of w'ralia trunks bending in the breeze . Everywhere , the soft , swooping vowels of Ruanja , the constant hum of Runa fathers loving babies who had not been meant to live . When she was stronger , she asked where she was . “
10019	10027	10016	10017	Trucha Sai	310	" she was told . Forget Us . “
10042	10054	10035	10036	the djanada	1066	” Kanchay explained , speaking simply as though to a child . “
10077	10096	10062	10062	We	1073	” It was more than an explanation , she understood . Kanchay had chosen his words with intent . “
10106	10121	10102	10104	first person plural	1076	” Emilio Sandoz had once told the other members of the Stella Maris party . “
10176	10295	10296	10296	Sipaj	311	” From all over the southern provinces of Inbrokar , Runa refugees joined the VaKashani in Trucha Sai . Each man carried a baby , each baby born to a Runa couple whose diets had been supplemented with plentiful food grown in gardens like that of the foreigners — couples who had come into CHILDREN OF GOD 25 season without Jana'ata supervision , who had mated without Jana'ata permission , who had circumvented Jana'ata stewardship with unthinking cheer , unintentional defiance . The Trucha Sai settlement slowly filled with men whose backs were raked with long , tripled , half - healed scars , gaily pink and waxy , that sliced through dense , buff - colored coats . “
10311	10330	10331	10331	Someone	1080	" Sofia had said one day , looking at those scars and remembering the journey to the forest . "
10342	10355	10335	10336	The Runao	312	“ Sipaj , Fia ! Someone 's child lives because of you . ”
10553	10563	10564	10565	her friend	1089	“ Rain falls on everyone ; lightning strikes some , ”
10569	10579	10580	10580	he	307	“ What can not be changed is best forgotten , "
10605	10618	10619	10619	Sofia	356	“ God made the world and He saw that it was good , ”
10637	10651	10619	10619	Sofia	356	“ Not fair . Not happy . Not perfect , Sofia . Good . ”
11141	11156	11137	11137	Kanchay	307	“ Sipaj , Fia , have you dreamt of the ones who are gone ? "
11546	11552	11553	11553	she	356	“ Someone 's head hurts , ”
11570	11574	11576	11576	Kanchay	307	“ Like Meelo , ”
11615	11624	11625	11625	he	307	“ Sipaj , Fia , come and sit , ”
11752	11759	11760	11760	Anne	301	“ Probably because we wear clothes , ”
11771	11782	11783	11783	Sofia	356	“ Sipaj , Kanchay , someone wonders about the ribbons , "
11843	11858	11859	11859	Kanchay	307	" We gave you this one for Dee , and this is for Ha'an , ”
11892	11908	11871	11871	his	307	“ These , for Djordj and for Djimi . These , for Meelo and Marc . ”
11956	11963	11964	11964	Sofia	356	“ Not for beauty , then , ”
11967	11977	11964	11964	Sofia	356	“ but to remember the ones who are gone ? "
11986	12031	12032	12032	he	307	" Not to remember ! To fool them ! If ghosts come back , they 'll follow the scent , back into the air where they belong . Sipaj , Fia , if you dream of those ones again , you should tell someone , ”
12048	12068	12045	12045	he	307	“ Sometimes ribbons are just pretty . The djanada think they 're only decoration . Sometimes that 's true . ”
12075	12087	12069	12069	He	307	“ The djanada are like ghosts . They can be fooled . ”
12246	12251	12252	12252	she	356	“ Why , Kanchay ? "
12262	12276	12252	12252	she	356	“ Why did the djanada patrol burn the gardens and kill the babies ? "
12277	12334	12353	12353	he	303	" Someone thinks the gardens were wrong . The people are meant to walk to their food . It was wrong to bring the food home . The djanada know when it 's the right time for us to have babies . Someone thinks the people were confused and had the babies at the wrong time . "
12372	12392	12398	12398	he	303	“ Sipaj , Kanchay — what gives the Jana'ata the right to say who can have babies and when ? ”
12393	12397	12398	12398	he	303	" The law , "
12423	12500	12419	12419	he	303	“ Sometimes the wrong baby can get into a woman . Sometimes the baby should have been a cranil , for example : In the old times , the people would take that kind of little one to the river and call out to the cranils , Here is one of your children born to us by mistake . We 'd hold the baby under the water , where the cranils live . It was hard . ”
12526	12581	12501	12501	He	303	“ Now when the wrong child comes to us by mistake , the djanada do the hard things . And when the djanada say , This is a good child , then we know all will be well with it . A mother can travel again . A father 's heart can be quiet . ”
12582	12605	12606	12606	His	303	“ Sipaj , Kanchay , what do you tell your children ? About giving themselves up to the Jana'ata to be eaten ? "
12634	12835	12613	12613	he	303	“ We tell them , In the old times , the people were alone in all the world . We traveled anywhere we liked without any danger , but we were lonely . When the djanada came , we were glad to see them and asked them , Have you eaten ? They said , We 're starving ! So , we offered them food — you must always feed travelers , you know . But the djanada could n't eat properly and they would n't take the food we offered . So the people talked and talked about what to do — it 's wicked to let guests go hungry . While we were talking , the djanada began to eat the children . Our elders said , They 're travelers , they 're guests — we have to feed them , but we 'll make rules . You must not eat just anyone , we told the djanada . You must eat only the old people who are no good anymore . That 's how we tamed the djanada . Now all the good children are safe and only old , tired , sick people are taken away . ”
12845	12871	12872	12872	He	1125	“ Someone thinks : this is a pretty story for children , so they will sleep well and not make fiernos when the cullers come . ”
12885	12928	12929	12929	she	356	" Sipaj , Kanchay , someone is small , but not a child who must be shielded from truth . The djanada kill the very old and the sick and the imperfect . Do they also kill the ones who make trouble ? "
12932	12949	12929	12929	she	356	“ Sipaj , Kanchay , why do you let them ? What gives them the right ? "
12961	12981	12955	12955	he	1125	“ If we refuse to go with the cullers when it 's time , others must take our places . ”
13003	13016	12987	12987	he	1125	“ Sipaj , Fia , surely this baby is ripe by now ! "
13023	13026	13027	13027	she	356	“ No , ”
13030	13039	13027	13027	she	356	“ not yet . Perhaps sixty nights more . "
13045	13059	13042	13044	Mary Doria Russell	264	“ So long ! Someone thinks you will pop like a datinsa pod . ”
13060	13065	13066	13066	she	356	“ Sipaj , Kanchay , ”
13074	13078	13066	13066	she	356	“ maybe so . "
13492	13495	13498	13500	the Father General	829	" Emilio ! "
13511	13525	13498	13500	the Father General	829	“ We have an unexpected visitor . Someone has come to meet you . ”
13526	13531	13532	13532	Sandoz	261	" Oh , Christ , ”
13546	13610	13498	13500	the Father General	829	" hands under his armpits . He went down the creaking stairs to the side door below and stopped to gather himself , pulling in a ragged breath and letting it out slowly . With a short , sharp movement of his elbow , he flipped the hook out of its eye on the door frame . Waited , doubled over and silent . “
13614	13619	13498	13500	the Father General	829	” he said finally . “
13624	13662	13498	13500	the Father General	829	” There was a tall priest standing in the driveway with Giuliani . East African , Sandoz thought , barely glancing at him , his flat - eyed stare resting instead on the Father General 's face . “
13672	13673	13670	13670	Vince	281	” “
13676	13681	13670	13670	Vince	281	” Giuliani said quietly , “
13685	13710	13711	13711	I	0	” Emilio was leaning against the wall , holding himself badly , but what could one do ? If Lopore had called ahead . ... “
13728	13729	13730	13730	You	261	" "
13734	13766	13730	13730	You	261	” Sandoz asked the visitor abruptly , in a Sudaneseaccented Arabic that came back to him out of nowhere . The question seemed to surprise the African , but he nodded . “
13770	13774	13730	13730	You	261	" Sandoz demanded . “
13779	13780	13730	13730	You	261	" "
13789	13794	13785	13787	A few others	1144	" the man said . "
13804	13810	13800	13800	He	261	" Sandoz said to Giuliani . “
13822	13828	13811	13811	You	261	” he told the African . “
13865	13879	13862	13862	you	261	” He glanced at Giuliani , who was clearly dismayed by the rudeness . “
13887	13901	13885	13885	Vince	281	” he muttered apologetically , as he started back up to his room . "
13913	13951	13908	13908	I	0	" And it 's your own damned fault for dropping in uninvited , he thought . But he was too close to tears to be defiant , and almost too tired to register what he heard next . “
13962	13973	13952	13952	I	0	” said Kalingemala Lopore in a voice full of wonder . “
13996	14131	13988	13988	I	0	" Sandoz stopped in his climb to the apartment and turned back . He remained hunched , arms crossed against his chest , but now looked closely at the priest standing next to the Father General . Sixtyish — maybe twenty years younger than Giuliani , and just as tall . Ebony and lean , with the strong bones and deep wide eyes that gave East African women beauty into old age and which made this man 's face arresting . Fifty years , he thought . This guy would have been what ? Ten , eleven ? Emilio glanced at Giuliani to see if he understood what was going on , but the Father General now seemed as much at a loss as Sandoz , and as startled by the visitor 's words . “
14137	14157	14133	14133	I	0	" Emilio asked . CHILDREN OF GOD 33 The African seemed lit from within , the extraordinary eyes glowing . “
14199	14278	14191	14191	Jeremiah	326	” And he held out both hands . Emilio hesitated before descending the stairs once more . In a gesture that felt , achingly , both familiar and alien , he placed his own fingers , scarred and impossibly long , into the pale , warm palms of the stranger . All these years , Lopore was thinking , his own shock so great that he forgot the artificiality of the plurals he had forced himself to master . “
14285	14297	14191	14191	Jeremiah	326	” he said , smiling , but then he looked down . “
14305	14371	14191	14191	Jeremiah	326	” he said sadly and , bringing the hands to his lips , kissed one and then the other unselfconsciously . It was , Sandoz thought later , an alteration in blood pressure perhaps , some quirk of neuromuscular interaction that ended the bout of hallucinatory neuralgia at last , but the African looked up at that moment , and met Emilio 's bewildered eyes . “
14382	14383	14384	14384	Sandoz	261	” "
14402	14405	14384	14384	Sandoz	261	“ Emilio , ”
14415	14427	14406	14407	Vincenzo Giuliani	262	“ perhaps you will invite the Holy Father to come upstairs ? "
14442	14445	14433	14433	Sandoz	261	“ Jesus ! ”
14458	14465	14448	14451	the Bishop of Rome	1148	“ No , only the Pope , "
14477	14492	14468	14470	the Father General	829	“ Father Sandoz has been a little out of touch the past few decades . ”
14763	14772	14773	14773	Sandoz	261	" I — I'm sorry about all this , ”
14784	14811	14777	14778	the Pontiff	1166	" One of the reasons We insisted on having Our own car was the desire to visit people without setting off an explosion of maniacal preparation , ”
14823	14837	14817	14817	he	329	“ We find We are thoroughly sick of fresh paint and new carpeting . ”
14854	14857	14858	14858	he	329	" Please , "
14866	14871	14858	14858	he	329	“ sit with me . ”
14907	14918	14919	14920	the Pope	996	“ My people are Dodoth . Herders , even now , ”
14942	15112	14919	14920	the Pope	996	" When the drought came , we went north to our cousins , the Toposa , in southern Sudan . It was a time of war and so , of famine . The Toposa drove us off — they had nothing . We asked , ' Where can we go ? ' A man on the road told us , ‘ There is a camp for Gikuyu east of here . They turn no one away . ' It was a long journey and , as we walked , my youngest sister died in my mother 's arms . You saw us coming . You walked out to my family . You took from my mother her daughter 's body , as gently as if the baby were your own . You carried that dead child and found us a place to rest . You brought us water , and then food . While we ate , you dug a grave for my sister . Do you recall now ? "
15114	15115	14919	14920	the Pope	996	" “
15128	15134	15135	15135	I	0	” Emilio looked up wearily . “
15146	15147	15135	15135	I	0	” “
15159	15191	15155	15155	you	0	” the Pope said , and Vincenzo Giuliani heard the voice of prophesy : ambiguous , elusive , sure . The moment passed and the Pontiff 's conversation became ordinary again . “
15248	15289	15290	15290	You	0	” He sat back in the chair , amazed that he should meet that unknown priest half a century later . He paused and then continued gently , a priest himself , whose office was to reconcile God and man . “
15303	15304	15305	15305	Hundreds	1177	” "
15319	15320	15309	15309	Thousands	334	” "
15357	15369	15370	15370	Askama	296	" He could , but only barely , almost without sound . “
15375	15522	15370	15370	Askama	296	" There was silence for a time and then Kalingemala Lopore reached across the small table , lifting Emilio 's bowed head with blunt , strong fingers , and smoothing away the tears . Vincenzo Giuliani had always thought of Emilio as dark , but with those powerful brown hands cupping his face , he looked ghostly , and then Giuliani realized that Sandoz had nearly fainted . Emilio hated being touched , loathed unexpected contact . Lopore could not have known this and Giuliani took a step forward , about to explain , when he realized that the Pope was speaking . Emilio listened , stone - faced , with the quick shallow movement of the chest that sometimes betrayed him . Giuliani could not hear their words , but he saw Sandoz freeze , and pull away , and stand and begin to pace . “
15557	15582	15587	15587	I	0	” Emilio said in the soft , musical Latin that a young Vince Giuliani had admired and envied when they were in formation together . “
15621	15628	15616	15616	God	264	" Sandoz turned away , trembling . “
15726	15789	15717	15717	God	264	" Giuliani , stunned , felt his eyes fill . Yes , he thought . Yes . But when Emilio turned again and faced Kalingemala Lopore , he was not weeping . He came back to the table and placed his ruined hands on a a » 36 • Mary Doria Russell » 9 its battered wood , face rigid with rage . “
15798	15802	15803	15804	The wives	1190	" he whispered . “
15842	15850	15839	15839	God	264	" The answer was immediate , certain . "

The turning point came several weeks after they arrived in Trucha Sai . “
18028	18041	18019	18019	Someone	1080	” Kanchay said , handing a computer tablet to her one morning . “
18049	18181	18043	18043	someone	1080	” Running her small hands over its smooth machined edges , feeling the well - known shape and heft , wiping off its photovoltaics , Sofia thanked Kanchay almost soundlessly and went off alone to sit against a downed w'ralia trunk , resting the tablet on her belly and drawn - up knees . After all the strangeness and fear , the confusion and sorrow , here was the ordinary , the familiar . Trembling , she called up the connect and gave a shouted gasp of relief when the Stella Maris library access appeared , patient and reliable as always . She lost herself in the system , downloading data as she went . Childbirth , related terms : Childbirth at Home , Childbirth in Middle Age . Natural Childbirth . "

18196	18354	18357	18363	an angel behind every blade of grass	1274	” she exclaimed aloud . Thoroughly mystified , she took a moment to pull the references up just to see what that could be about . Nonsense , she decided , and went on . Child Development — thousands of citations . She pulled out Infant Development - Normal , and , perhaps su- 42 Mary Doria Russell perstitiously , bypassed references on Autism , Developmental Disablement , and Failure to Thrive .

If this constitutes being watched over by God , I 'd be better off as a blade of grass . And yet . ... A daughter , please , she prayed swiftly . A little girl . A small healthy girl . But Sofia had never relied on God , who tended to be terse even when He was clearly on the job . Go to Pharaoh and free My people , He said , and left the logistics to Moses as a lesson in self - reliance . So she spent the next weeks reading and absorbing on - line books and articles , creating an AI obstetrician : synthesizing , laying out sequences , finding branch points , reducing as much as possible to “
18567	18805	18806	18806	Sipaj	311	” statements , wherever the action was feasible on Rakhat , among the Runa . She refined her explanations to simple sentences , graphic and plain ; entered them in Ruanja so that she might look up her own or her baby 's distress and , without thinking , give instructions that might save them both . And in doing all this , she lost some of her fear , if not any of her hope . THE CULLS WENT ON , ACROSS SOUTHERN INBROKAR — ANYWHERE THE gardens had been planted . Runa fathers in little groups of twos and threes continued to arrive with infants , bringing news as well . Once women from Kashan visited , led by the girl named Djalao , who was made much of by the men who 'd heeded her warning that the djanada patrols were coming . Aware now that Djalao VaKashan had saved her life and the lives of many others , Sofia took the girl aside to thank her during a brief lull in the murmur of Ruanja that filled the redlit evenings , when fathers gathered to talk children to sleep , arms over bellies , tails over legs , back against back . Ears high , Djalao accepted Sofia 's gratitude without embarrassment , and it CHILDREN OF GOD 43 was this as much as anything that prompted Sofia to take the conversation further . “

22484	22521	22523	22523	you	0	" Five ? Six ! Litters ? Supaari wondered then . How can they allow so many ? He felt sometimes that he understood only one thing in twelve of what he learned about the foreigners . “

22598	22618	22619	22619	You	0	" Supaari was shocked to learn this about the little foreigner , whom he had come to care for . “
22629	22630	22635	22636	this one	1436	" “
22645	22704	22705	22705	Sandoz	261	” But there are none of your kind to serve here , Supaari thought . Confounded , he fell back against the pile of dining cushions on which he had lingered as the leavings of his meal cooled , and thought wistfully of the days when his most perplexing problem was predicting next season 's demand for kirt . "
22707	22720	22705	22705	Sandoz	261	" he said , reaching out to grip some kind of certainty , “
22732	22733	22734	22734	Lord	5712	” “
22752	22753	22754	22754	Ha'an	318	” "
22759	22775	22754	22754	Ha'an	318	" Supaari cried , making sense at last of something Anne Edwards had once said . “
22790	22848	22779	22779	you	261	” He stared at Sandoz : not an interpreter bred to trade , but a second - born who chose to make no children , and a poet who serves many ! No wonder Sandoz had shown no interest in commerce ! That was when everything fell into place — it seemed brilliant , at the time . "
22866	22882	22885	22885	lord	5712	" For the first time in a full season , the foreigner seemed to brighten . “
22897	23168	23171	23172	the foreigner	1405	” So Supaari set out to make this possible . The negotiations were delicate , intricate , delicious . In the end , he achieved a subtle and beautifully balanced transaction : the crowning achievement of a remarkably successful mercantile career . The foreigner Sandoz would be provided with a life a of service to Hlavin Kitheri , the Reshtar of Galatna , whose diminishing a 52 Mary Doria Russell a poetic power might once more be lifted to greatness by inspiring encounters with the foreigner . The Reshtar 's younger sister , Jholaa , would be released from the enforced barrenness of her existence , as would Supaari himself , by their marriage and by the foundation of the new Darjan lineage with full breeding rights . Since Supaari VaGayjur 's own wealth would endow the Darjan , the Most Noble Patrimony of Inbrokar gained a third sept without any hint of unseemly inconstancy : an ideal multiplication of descent lines with no division of inheritance . Agreement reached , the transfer of custody took place . Sandoz appeared to settle into the Reshtar 's household reasonably well after his placement in Galatna Palace . Supaari himself had overseen the foreigner 's presentation to the Reshtar ; he was , in fact , a little unnerved by the pathetic , trembling eagerness with which Sandoz invited Kitheri 's attentions . But the merchant left Galatna Palace elated over his own good fortune , and believing that he had done right by Sandoz . It was n't long before Supaari realized that there might have been some kind of misunderstanding . "
23174	23191	23171	23172	the foreigner	1405	" he inquired some days after the transfer , hoping to hear that Sandoz was thriving . "
23195	23215	23171	23172	the foreigner	1405	" was the reply . Even after his initiation , the Reshtar 's secretary reported , Sandoz was extraordinary : “
23223	23852	23218	23219	a virgin	1447	” The Reshtar was pleased and had already produced a splendid song cycle . His best in years , everyone said . The puzzle , Supaari learned , was that the foreigner reacted to sex with violent sickness . This was disturbing but , Supaari thought , it was evidently normal for his kind . One of the other foreigners had been bred just before she was killed in the Kashan riot , and Sofia too had trouble with nausea . In any case , the deal was done ; there was no second - guessing it now . And the Reshtar 's poetry was lovely . So was Supaari 's new home , the city of Inbrokar ; so was his new wife , the lady Jholaa . But then the poetry took a very odd turn , and the Reshtar was silenced . . And Inbrokar was maddeningly boring compared to the bustle of Gayjur . Jholaa , Supaari noted wryly , was not boring but she was , quite likely , mad . And Sandoz was gone now , sent back to wherever he came from by the second party from H’earth , which had itself disappeared . Returned to H'earth as well , most likely . Who knew ? In view of how the mating had turned out , Supaari was inclined to wish he 'd never known any of them — Sandoz , the Reshtar , Jholaa . Fool : this is what comes of change , Supaari told himself . Move a pebble , risk a landslide . a CHILDREN OF GOD 53 It was then that Supaari realized with sickening certainty that if he was to sire another child to take this one 's place , his second encounter with Jholaa would be even uglier than the first . At this level of society , bloodlines were guarded like treasure , and it occurred to him that Jholaa had probably never even seen Runa bred , which was the way most commoners got their first instruction in sex . Supaari had initially approached the lady with a certain untraditional anticipation of the staggering erotic beauty defined and promised by the Reshtar 's poetry , but it had quickly become clear that Jholaa herself was unfamiliar with her famous brother 's more recent literary output . The child Supaari would kill in the morning had , on the occasion of her conception , nearly cost her sire an eye ; he 'd have funked the job entirely if pheromones and the irresistible scent of blood had n't taken over . When the union was concluded , Supaari had retreated from it with lief , badly disillusioned . And he understood at last why so many Jana'ata aristocrats preferred to be serviced by Runa concubines — bred for enjoyment and trained to delight — the moment their dynastic duty had been accomplished . reSLEEPING NOW AND EXHAUSTED FROM THE STRUGGLE TO EXPEL HER husband 's brat , the lady Jholaa Kitheri u Darjan had always been more of a dynastic idea than a person . Like most females of her caste , Jholaa Kitheri had been kept catastrophically ignorant , but she was not stupid . Allowed to see nothing of genuine importance , she was keenly observant of emotional minutiae — astute enough to wonder , even as a girl , if it was malice or simply thoughtless cruelty when , at her father 's whim , she was allowed beyond her chamber and permitted to recline silently on silken cushions in a dim corner of an awninged courtyard during some minor state gathering . But even on those rare occasions , no one came near or even glanced in her direction . “
23866	23880	23881	23881	Srokan	374	” Jholaa had cried out at this indifference when she was only ten . “
23893	23894	23888	23889	no one	5227	” “
23914	23926	23904	23904	she	1450	” her Runa nursemaid said , hoping to distract the child . “

23974	24160	23964	23964	I	0	” Jholaa declared that day , shaking off Srokan 's embrace , and gave herself the task of staying awake past second sundown , and then past the setting of Rakhat 's third and smallest sun , to see for herself these glorious moons . There was no one to deny her this , no bar to her ambition except the powerful drowsiness of childhood and of species . It was as frightening as anything a Jana'ata could do , but Srokan was there in the courtyard with her , telling stories and sharing gossip , her fine hands stroking Jholaa : calming the girl as she lost sight first of blues and next of yellows , contrast fading to a gray lightlessness and then to a dense darkness as confining as an aristocratic woman 's life . The only things that staved off blind panic were Srokan 's voice and the comforting familiar scents of nursery bedding and incense , and the aroma of roasted meat lingering in the air . Suddenly , Srokan gripped Jholaa 's arms and lifted her to her feet . “
24173	24219	23964	23964	I	0	" she whispered urgently , holding Jholaa 's head so that the girl would look in the right direction — so she could see , like small cold suns , the glowing disks : moons in inky blackness , beautiful and remote as mountain snow . “
24229	24234	24235	24238	Daughters of the moons	1455	" Srokan told her . “
24244	24306	24240	24242	Tiny sparkling babies	1456	” Jana’ata eyes were not made to see such things and Jholaa could only accept her nurse 's word that this was so , and not some silly Runa story . This was the only memorable event of her childhood . For a time , Jholaa shared isolation with the Kitheri Reshtar , her thirdborn brother , Hlavin . His title meant “
24309	24639	24240	24242	Tiny sparkling babies	1456	" and like Jholaa , Hlavin 's purpose was simply to exist , ready to transmit the patrimony should either of their elder brothers come to nothing . Hlavin was the only one aside from Srokan who noticed Jholaa , telling her stories and amusing her with secret songs , even though he was beaten for singing when his tutor caught him at it . Who but Hlavin could have made her laugh as the wives of Dherai and Bhansaar filled nurseries with children who displaced Hlavin and Jholaa in the Kitheri succession ? Who but Hlavin would have cried out for her , moved to keening by her story of the moons , and by her confession that as each new niece and nephew was born , Jholaa herself felt more and more like a moon child : invisible to her own people , sparkling , undreamt of , in the darkness . Then Dherai 's own Reshtar was born , and then Bhansaar 's ; the succession was deemed stable , and Hlavin was taken from her , exiled to the port of Gayjur to safeguard his nephews ' lives from a young uncle 's frustrated CHILDREN OF GOD 55 ambition . Even in exile , Hlavin found a way to sing to her , and sent Jholaa a radio receiver so that she could hear her own words about the moons ' daughters , riding on waves as invisible as stars , woven into a transcendent cantata sung during his first broadcast from Galatna Palace , which was allowed because he did not sing the traditional chants that belonged to those born first or second , but something new and wholly other . The concert left Jholaa angry , somehow , as if her words had been stolen from her , not given as a gift . When the music ended , she swept the radio from its pedestal , as though it were to blame . “
24644	24655	24240	24242	Tiny sparkling babies	1456	" she demanded as Srokan bent to gather the wreckage . “
24682	24696	24679	24680	my lady	1460	” Srokan told her . Srokan looked up , her blue eyes wide . “
24725	24726	24727	24727	You	1460	" "
24752	24772	24744	24744	You	1460	” Jholaa said with flat contempt , old enough , by then , to know a master 's fear . “
24778	24787	24775	24776	little one	1462	" Srokan cried with good - natured surprise . “
24849	25422	25423	25424	A virgin	1447	" Resentment was , by then , the only leavening that could lift Jholaa from the torpor that immobilized her for days at a time . She had come to hate the luckless Runa domestics who were her only companions , despising their ability to go into the world , the shameless sluts , unveiled and unguarded , to see oceans and breathe scents Jholaa would never know . Holding an elegant claw to Srokan 's ear , Jholaa began to peel it from the woman 's head , relenting only when the Runao admitted she had not seen or tasted this ocean herself and had only heard stories from the kitchen help , who came from the south . Hlavin would have told her the truth of the ocean , but he was lost to her , so Jholaa allowed her nursemaid 's shaking hands to stroke and soothe her , and breathed in the salt scent of blood , not ocean . Later that night , as Jholaa lay blind in the dark , useless light of Rakhat 's small , red sun , she decided to execute Srokan for thinking how she might murder Jana'ata in their sleep , and to have the woman 's children killed as well , to clear the line . Srokan was old anyway . Stew meat , Jholaa thought dismissively . 56 Mary Doria Russell Which was why there was no one to warn Jholaa or to prepare her for what would happen after her wedding : her domestics were frightened of her and none had the courage to explain why they were dressing her for a state ceremony . But Jholaa was used to being displayed on such occasions , and was not surprised to find herself taken to a stateroom filled with dazzlingly decorated officials and all her male relatives , who continued to chant , as though she were not there . She stood quietly through the endless ceremonial declamations ; these events tended to go on for days , and she had long since given up listening carefully . But when she heard her own name sung , she began to pay attention , and then she recognized the melody that sealed a marriage , and realized that she 'd just been legally bound to a man whose lineal name she 'd never heard before . Eyes wide behind her jewel - encrusted veil of gold mesh , she turned to ask someone — anyone — if she were being sent to another country , but before she could speak , her father and brothers surrounded her and moved Jholaa to the center of the room . Her Runa maids reappeared and , when they began to remove her robes , Jholaa spoke up , demanding to know what was happening , but the men only laughed . Furious now and frightened , she tried to cover herself , but then the man whose name she could not quite remember came so close she could smell him , and dropped his own robe off his shoulders and he—. He did not merely look at her , but moved behind her and gripped her ankles and She fought , but her screams and struggle were drowned by the wedding guests ' roars of amusement and approval . Afterward , she heard her father comment with chuckling pride to the others , “
25435	25443	25448	25449	a fighter	1471	" To which her eldest brother replied , “
25651	25656	25659	25659	she	369	" Kill it then , "

25739	25743	25731	25731	he	261	“ Go away ! ”
25744	25753	25774	25774	Sandoz	261	“ I hope you 're talking to God , ”
25759	25769	25774	25774	Sandoz	261	“ because I 'm not going back to Chicago . ”
25770	25773	25774	25774	Sandoz	261	“ John ? "
25790	25793	25794	25794	he	261	" Candotti ! ”
25806	25817	25794	25794	he	261	“ I thought they sent you home after the hearings ! "
25818	25829	25835	25836	John Candotti	378	“ They did . Now they 've sent me back . ”
25868	25884	25885	25885	Sandoz	261	“ What is this ? I got ta be the Pope to get invited in ? "
25908	25913	25914	25914	he	261	“ Come on up , ”
25920	25926	25914	25914	he	261	“ The door 's open . ”
25927	25946	25947	25947	John	378	“ So ! El Cahuna Grande tells me you just interviewed the Holy Father for a research assistantship , ”
25973	25982	25983	25987	a a CHILDREN OF GOD	1298	“ Nice play , Sandoz . Very slick . ”
25989	25999	26000	26000	Emilio	261	“ Thank you so much for pointing that out , ”
26026	26046	26013	26013	He	261	“ Now why do n't you give me a nice paper cut and pour some lemon juice in it ? "
26047	26054	26055	26055	John	378	" Billy Crystal . Princess Bride , ”
26067	26087	26055	26055	John	378	" You need some new material , man . Did you watch any of . those comedies I suggested ? "
26088	26125	26126	26126	he	261	“ Yeah . I liked that Dutch one , East of Edam , best . No Sign of Life was good , too . I do n't get the jokes in the newer stuff . Anyway , ”
26132	26153	26126	26126	he	261	“ how was I supposed to know who the Pope was ? Some old guy shows up at my doorstep — ”
26154	26162	26163	26163	John	378	“ If you 'd taken my advice , ”
26175	26198	26163	26163	John	378	“ you would have gotten the jokes . And you would have recognized the effing Pope when he came to meet you ! ”
26233	26274	26204	26204	he	261	“ Do you have any idea how important it was that Gelasius came to us ? I told you — it 's time for you to catch up on things ! But do you ever listen to me ? No ! "
26329	26379	26318	26318	Giuliani	309	” Sandoz was muttering as he pulled each hand into an open brace and then rocked the atrophied forearms outward to toggle the switches . There was a quiet whirring noise as the flat straps and electronic hardware closed over his fingers , wrists and forearms . He straightened . “
26396	26397	26387	26387	I	0	” “
26401	26405	26387	26387	I	0	” John said . “
26422	26533	26408	26408	I	0	" They sat at the table , Sandoz slouching into the chair nearest the kitchen and John taking the Pope 's seat opposite him . Glancing around the room as they traded lines from East of Edam and Back Streets and a couple of old Mimi Jensen flicks , John took in the bed , the socks on the floor , the dishes in the sink , and then stared suspiciously at Emilio , rumpled and unshaven . Sandoz was ordinarily meticulous , the black - and - silver hair brushed , the conquistador beard closely trimmed , his clothes spotless . John had expected the apartment to be immaculate . “
26544	26563	26564	26564	You	1495	” Candotti intoned , waving 60 Mary Doria Russell broadly at the mess . He frowned at Emilio . "
26579	26580	26564	26564	You	1495	" “
26610	26640	26604	26604	You	1495	" Emilio rose and went to the tiny kitchen , where he opened the cupboard and pulled out the beans , making himself busy with his back to Candotti . “
26659	26660	26700	26700	Giuliani	309	" “
26664	26686	26700	26700	Giuliani	309	” Sandoz put the coffee back , banging the cupboard door , and sank into the chair across the table again . “
26698	26699	26694	26694	I	0	" “
26709	26713	26700	26700	Giuliani	309	” John persisted . “
26724	26733	26720	26720	They	1497	” he cried , gesturing at them accusingly . “
26740	26741	26700	26700	Giuliani	309	" “
26756	26765	26766	26766	My	0	" Sandoz said with a sudden acid vivacity . “
26821	26853	26854	26854	I	0	" Sandoz stared out the window for a moment , getting a grip on himself , and then glanced at John , who sat impassively , a veteran of these outbursts . “
26875	26889	26895	26895	you	0	" John waited a moment , and then finished the sentence for him . “
26903	26917	26895	26895	you	0	” Emilio did n't agree , but he did n't deny it either . “
26934	26935	26895	26895	you	0	” “
26941	26964	26895	26895	you	0	” John agreed . Emilio laughed , and John knew if you could get Sandoz to laugh , you were halfway home . “
26970	26984	26895	26895	you	0	" he asked . Sandoz shrugged the question off , eyes sliding away . “
26999	27005	27006	27006	I	0	" He glanced at John . “
27011	27012	27006	27006	I	0	” “
27022	27026	27027	27027	I	0	” John said , “
27035	27078	27027	27027	I	0	” He slapped his hands on his thighs and stood , but rather than leave , he went to the sound - analysis gear along the gable wall opposite the stairway . Curious , he looked it over and then spoke casually . “
27101	27121	27123	27123	me	0	” Sandoz closed his eyes and twisted in the chair so he could stare over his shoulder at John . “
27125	27147	27123	27123	me	0	" CHILDREN OF GOD 61 a John turned , grinning , but his smile disappeared when he saw Emilio 's face . "
27170	27180	27164	27164	My	0	” John admitted , faltering under the chilly gaze . “
27201	27202	27197	27197	you	1500	” "
27207	27212	27203	27203	You	1500	” Emilio said flatly . “
27221	27222	27219	27219	John	378	” “
27256	27261	27262	27262	My	0	” John said defensively . “
27298	27319	27320	27320	John	378	” Sandoz , by this time , was shaking his head , not sure whether to laugh or to cry . “
27336	27405	27320	27320	John	378	” Only that he had missed Candotti . Only that he needed help but hated asking for it , needed colleagues but dreaded breaking in someone new . Father John Candotti , whose great gift as a priest was to forgive , had heard everything — and still , somehow , failed to despise or pity him . Emilio 's voice was mercifully steady when he found it . “
27431	27432	27320	27320	John	378	” “
27436	27466	27320	27320	John	378	” John declared confidently , for his life had not taught him to brace for the unexpected blow . He headed toward the stairway down to the garage level . “
27472	27473	27469	27469	I	0	" “
27498	27511	27492	27492	I	0	” Sandoz announced as firmly as he could around a huge yawn . “
27580	27607	27578	27578	John	378	” He put his left hand on the tabletop , rocking the arm outward to unhinge the braces , then froze , struck by a thought . “
27610	27614	27578	27578	John	378	” he said . “
27625	27632	27616	27616	Giuliani	309	” There was a long silence . “
27635	27639	27616	27616	Giuliani	309	” John said . “
27644	27645	27616	27616	Giuliani	309	” “
27653	27660	27647	27647	you	1507	" John nodded , eyes serious . “
27668	27688	27665	27665	I	0	" Breaking out of the paralysis , Emilio fell back against his chair and quoted Ignatius with brittle grandiosity . “
27703	27704	27665	27665	I	0	” “
27711	27716	27717	27717	I	0	” John said solemnly , “

27751	27767	27731	27731	I	0	” Emilio finished with him . He snorted a laugh , and shook his head . “

27855	27865	27848	27849	the Jebs	384	” John said , rejoining him at the table . “

27880	27884	27885	27885	Partly	387	" Sandoz asked . “

27952	27956	27960	27960	he	1511	” Emilio intoned . “
28000	28004	28005	28005	I	0	" John winced . “
28057	28064	28024	28024	He	1517	” Sandoz whistled , eyes wide . “

28160	28164	28157	28158	the others	1111	” Emilio asked . “
28218	28225	28215	28216	Sean Fein	390	" Sandoz looked at him blankly . “
28230	28234	28215	28216	Sean Fein	390	” John advised . “
28239	28246	28235	28235	You	0	” Sandoz said after a moment . “

28294	28299	28261	28261	Sandoz	261	” Emilio said sympathetically . “

28376	28377	28371	28371	he	390	" "
28384	28389	28392	28392	he	309	” Emilio commented dryly . “
28404	28405	28400	28402	the other guy	1532	” “
28423	28424	28459	28459	he	390	" “
28427	28432	28459	28459	he	390	” Sandoz corrected him . “

28452	28456	28459	28459	he	390	" John shrugged . “
28525	28537	28518	28518	he	390	" John dug a scrap of paper out of his pocket . “
28546	28569	28542	28542	you	0	" Emilio took the paper in his right hand , still braced , moving it back and forth at arm 's length . “
28584	28598	28599	28601	Joseba Gastainazatorre Urizarbarrena	395	” he noted ruefully , but then he got a bead on it . “
28603	28604	28599	28601	Joseba Gastainazatorre Urizarbarrena	395	" “
28609	28613	28599	28601	Joseba Gastainazatorre Urizarbarrena	395	” John muttered . "
28628	28633	28618	28618	himself	1536	” Sandoz remarked informatively . “

28672	28676	28667	28668	poor mortals	1538	” John asked . “
28680	28692	28667	28668	poor mortals	1538	” Emilio suggested , yawning as he unhinged the second brace . “
28711	28741	28699	28699	José	261	” John tried it a couple of times and seemed satisfied that he could manage , as long as nobody expected him to go past the first three syllables . “
28775	28791	28768	28768	I	0	” John said , as Emilio yawned for the third time in as many minutes . “
28802	28803	28804	28804	I	0	" “
28810	28819	28804	28804	I	0	” Emilio said , moving toward his bed . “
28830	28874	28822	28822	John	378	” Candotti nodded happily and stood to leave , but paused at the top of а a 64 Mary Doria Russell the stairs and looked back . Emilio , too whipped to undress , had already fallen onto his mattress in a heap . “
28877	28881	28884	28884	you	1541	” John said , “
28895	28902	28884	28884	you	1541	" Emilio kept his eyes closed . “
28913	28920	28905	28905	John	378	” he asked dutifully before muttering , “
28927	28928	28905	28905	John	378	” “
28948	28949	28942	28942	you	1541	" “
28957	28963	28942	28942	you	1541	” The eyes popped open . “
28973	28990	28942	28942	you	1541	" Sandoz asked the ceiling in rhetorical wonderment . There was a hoot of genuine amusement . “
29005	29043	28942	28942	you	1541	" Candotti snorted , startled by the idea , but Sandoz rose on his elbows , transfixed by the sheer delicious absurdity of it , his face vivid , all the tiredness draining away for a minute . “
29048	29108	28942	28942	you	1541	" he started and , falling back on the bed , he began to improvise , obscenely and hilariously fluent , on the broad literary theme of prison romance in terms that rendered John breathless . Finally , when Sandoz had exhausted himself and his topic and John had wiped his eyes and caught his breath , Candotti cried , “
29125	29126	29123	29123	Emilio	261	” “
29153	29209	29123	29123	Emilio	261	” Candotti laughed again and told Sandoz to say two rosaries for having spectacularly impure thoughts , and waved and started down the stairs . He was almost out the door when he heard Emilio call his name . Hand on the knob , still grinning , he looked back up toward Sandoz 's room . “
29212	29213	29214	29214	John	378	” “

29257	29282	29251	29251	I	0	” Sucker - punched , Candotti sagged against the doorjamb . A moment later , Sandoz 's voice went on , quiet and hesitant . "
29303	29327	29328	29328	Emilio	261	" John ascended the stairs partway and then halted , as unwilling as Sandoz to carry out this awful conversation face to face . "

29366	29373	29361	29361	I	0	" Candotti waited and then heard , “
29409	29428	29429	29429	I	0	” John sat heavily on a stair tread and rubbed his face with his hands as Emilio said , “
29471	29472	29460	29460	I	0	" “
29488	29535	29480	29480	I	0	" John stood and headed back down the stairs , feeling ten years older than he 'd been five minutes ago . As he shambled his loose - limbed way over to the main house , he heard Emilio 's call drift out the dormer window : “
29540	29558	29538	29538	John	378	” He waved a hand dispiritedly , without looking back , knowing Emilio could n't see him . "
29564	30081	29561	29561	You	0	” John whispered , and felt a nasty crawling sensation on his face as wind off the Bay of Naples dried the tears . 7 City of Inbrokar 2046 , Earth - Relative THE ERROR , IF THAT 'S WHAT IT WAS , LAY IN GOING TO SEE THE CHILD . Who knows what would have happened if Supaari VaGayjur had simply waited until the morning and , unsuspecting , freed his child 's spirit to find a better fate ? But the midwife came to him , sure that he would want to see the baby , and he was rarely able to resist the uncomplicated friendship the Runa always seemed to offer him . So Supaari strode toward the nursery importantly : heavy embroidered robe rustling as softly as his slippered footsteps , eyes focused on the middle distance , ignoring the Runa midwife 's chatter with his ears cocked forward , not deigning to reply to her pleasantriesall in conscious mimicry of an aristocratic Jana’ata crammed full of incorruptible civic virtue and monumental self - regard . Who am I to sneer ? Supaari asked himself . A jumped - up merchant prone to unfortunate commercial metaphors in conversation with his betters . A third - born son from a backwater town in the midlands who made a fortune brokering trade among the Runa . An outsider among outsiders , who 'd literally stumbled onto a pack of impossible foreigners from somewhere beyond Rakhat 's three suns , and parlayed that experience into this exacting facsimile of nobility that nobody but the Runa believed in . He 'd known from the moment the Reshtar agreed to his proposition that he would never be more than who he was . It did n't matter . Isolation a CHILDREN OF GOD 67 felt normal to him . Supaari 's life had always been an interstitial one , lived between the worlds of Runa and Jana'ata ; he enjoyed the perspective , preferred observation to participation . He 'd spent his first year among these exalted members of his own species studying the habits of the men around him as carefully as the hunter studies his prey . He came to savor the growing accuracy with which he predicted the snubs . He could anticipate who would refuse outright to attend a reception if he attended , and who would come for the sport of baiting him ; who would fail to greet him entirely , and who would do so but with a gesture more properly due a second . Firsts preferred direct insult ; seconds were more subtle . His eldest brother - in - law , Dherai , would push past Supaari through a door , but the second - born Bhansaar would merely stand as though Supaari were invisible and enter the room a moment later , as though it had just occurred to him to go inside . Inbrokar society , taking its cue from the Kitheri princelings , ignored Supaari or gazed at him contemptuously from corners . Sometimes the word “
30083	30163	30164	30164	She	1550	” would rise above the general conversation , sinking a moment later beneath gentle waves of well - bred amusement . Privately entertained , Supaari had borne all this with courteous detachment and genuine patience : for the sake of a son and a future . The nursery was far into the interior of the compound . He had no idea where Jholaa was . The Runa midwife Paquarin had assured him of his wife 's health but added , “
30181	30187	30164	30164	She	1550	” the Runao said thankfully . "
30223	30227	30164	30164	She	1550	" she complained . “
30237	30662	30164	30164	She	1550	” Paquarin admitted that Jholaa was upset by the birth , when Supaari asked . Naturally . Another reason for his wife to hate him : he 'd gotten a deformity on her . Busy with his thoughts , it was only when Supaari heard soft , huffing Runa laughter and cheerful , harmless Runa chatter drifting out of the kitchen with the smell of spices and frying vegetables that he realized Paquarin had led him through the nursery and past it . Passing through one last louvered door and entering a barren courtyard at the back of the compound , he noticed a small wooden box pushed into a corner of the yard . This was what he 'd been brought to see , and he stopped in midstride . No lavish embroidered nest net , no festive ribbons fluttering in the breeze to catch the child 's eye and train attention to movement . Just a rag from the kitchen draped over the crate to shade her , to hide her shame- 68 Mary Doria Russell a > a a a and his own — from sight . It was not a new box , Supaari noted . It was ordinarily used for Runa infants , he supposed . A cradle for a cook 's child . Another man might have blamed the midwife , but not Supaari VaGayjur . Ah , Bhansaar , he thought . A hit . May your children become scavengers . May you live to see them eat carrion . He had not expected this , not even after a year of affinal insult and effrontery . He accepted that his daughter was doomed . No one would marry a cripple . She was more hopeless than a third , first - born but fouled . Of all the things he had learned of the foreigners ' customs , the most incomprehensible , the most unethical was the notion that anyone could breed , even those known to carry traits that would damage their offspring . What kind of people would inflict known disease on their own grandchildren ? Well , not us ! he 'd thought . Not Jana'ata ! Even so , Dherai might have overridden Bhansaar 's pettiness and allowed the child a decent nest in the nursery for her single night of life . Daughters who serve travelers , Supaari thought savagely . Cowards for sons , Dherai . He strode to the cradle , snatching the cloth away with a hooked claw . “
30673	30687	30671	30671	lord	5712	” the midwife said hurriedly , frightened by the acrid smell of anger . "
30697	30868	30688	30688	She	923	" And who is to blame ? he meant to demand . Who put her in this detestable little—. Who brought her to this wretchedI did , he thought bleakly , gazing down . Bathed , fed and sleeping , his daughter had the fragrance of rain in the first moments of a storm . He was dizzy with it , actually swayed before kneeling . Studying her tiny perfect face , he raised his hands to his mouth and bit hard , six times , severing each long claw at the quick , bewitched by the need to hold her and to do so without harming her . Almost at the same moment , he realized that he 'd just committed a humiliating and irreversible gaffe . Clawless , he would have to let Ljaat - sa Kitheri carry out the father 's duty after all . But his mind was not clear , and he lifted his child from the box , bringing her awkwardly to his chest . “
30882	30898	30873	30873	She	1559	” the Runa midwife observed guilelessly , happy now that the Jana’ata had calmed himself . “
30907	31061	30900	30900	she	1559	” He laughed in spite of everything and , careless of his robes , shifted on the damp clay tiles that were still shining from the morning 's drizzle , so that he could rest the baby in his lap . Aching , he ran a hand along the velvety softness of her cheek , his stubby fingertips feeling strangely naked , a CHILDREN OF GOD 69 а a and as unprotected as his daughter 's throat . I was not meant to breed , he thought . Her twisted foot is a sign . I have done everything wrong . With all his considerable courage , his own throat tight , Supaari fumbled at the wrappings that concealed her , forcing himself to look at what had destined this child to die in infancy , taking all his hopes with her into darkness . What he saw pulled the breath from him . "
31064	31080	31081	31081	Paquarin	400	" he said very carefully , in a voice he hoped would not alarm her . “
31094	31095	31096	31098	The ranking uncles	1564	" “
31131	31175	31176	31177	The lady	5758	” Paquarin reported thoughtlessly . But hearing her own words , she realized she 'd done wrong . Jholaa wanted the baby dead even before its deformity was discovered . The Runao began to sway from side to side , but stopped suddenly . “
31191	31226	31176	31177	The lady	5758	” she told Supaari then , and truthfully , although Jholaa had said it some years ago . Pleased with her own cleverness in stitching this into the present , Paquarin rattled on righteously , “
31271	31305	31261	31263	This helpful one	1574	” Still stunned , only half - hearing Paquarin 's chatter , Supaari looked at the midwife for a long while . Finally , making his face kindly and reassuring , he asked , “
31327	31349	31350	31350	Someone	1080	” Embarrassed , she flattened her ears and she swayed again , more rapidly , and fell into her native Ruanja . "
31375	31376	31380	31380	Paquarin	400	” “
31392	31420	31382	31382	You	400	" He handed the infant to the midwife , each movement as controlled and careful as those he would have performed in the next morning 's ritual . “
31437	31455	31456	31456	Sipaj	311	” he told her . To be sure she understood , he said directly , in Ruanja , “
31465	31521	31460	31460	someone	1080	” Eyes closed , ears folded back in terror , Paquarin offered her throat , expecting he would kill her to obtain it , but he smiled and reached out to calm her with a hand on her head , as a Runa father might , and assured her once again that she was good . “
31531	31566	31569	31569	lord	5712	" he suggested . He did not offer money , knowing that natural affection would keep her in the courtyard : this woman 's line was bred to loyalty . . 70 Mary Doria Russell “
31595	31596	31587	31587	Someone	1080	” “
31603	31609	31601	31601	Paquarin	400	” he told her again . “
31630	31631	31634	31634	lord	5712	" "
31636	32646	31634	31634	lord	5712	" He left Paquarin in midcurtsy and moved without unseemly haste through the nursery . Heard the laughter and scuffling of Ljaat - sa Kitheri 's half - grown grandchildren , and decided that the boys ' noisy wrestling was the only sign of genuine life in this dead and stifling place , and wished them luck in killing their fathers early . Walked down narrow corridors , past empty staterooms , hearing muffled snatches of conversation behind closed and curtained doors . Strode past placid Runa porters standing vigil at each doorway , well suited to their job , too phlegmatic to notice boredom . Nodded to them as they opened the inner gates and the outer portcullis and saluted his passing . Escaped , at last , onto the quiet street . There was no sense of release , even beyond the compound . No feeling of being under the sky , inside the wind . Supaari glared up at the piercedwood balconies and the overhanging eaves , seemingly designed to prevent the rain from ever washing the streets clean . Why does no one sweep here ? he wondered irritably , ankle - deep in blown litter , outraged by the compacted , cluttered heaviness of the place . Inbrokar was chained and hobbled by every moment of its convoluted , incestuous history . Nothing is made here , he realized for the first time . It was a city of aristocrats and advisers , of agents and analysts , forever ranking and comparing , manuevering endlessly in feverish self - promotion and predatory competition . Madness , to believe he could ever have begun something here . Folly , to rage against this city 's perpetual self - imposed darkness , its fibrous , matted preoccupation with position and degree . Moving through a city he had once found beautiful , he was greeted here and there with counterfeit deference by various Kitheri friends , acquaintances , hangers - on . Their condolences came rather too soon , the child brought to light this very day and its birth unheralded , but they were as properly composed as their authors ' faces . How long has this been planned ? Supaari wondered . How many had been alerted to this delicious and elaborate joke , waiting out his wife 's pregnancy , as anxious as he had been for the appearance of an infant he was meant to kill ? It occurred to him then that the luxurious thoroughness of the plot stank of the Reshtar 's subtle sensibility . Who had spoken first of swapping Sandoz for Jholaa ? he wondered , stumbling a little at the thought . Had CHILDREN OF GOD 71 Hlavin Kitheri steered him toward the arrangement from the start ? Stag . gered , Supaari leaned against a wall and tried to reconstruct the negotiations , carried out in language as ornate as the Reshtar 's palace , in the company of poets and singers who shared Hlavin 's voluptuous exile and who had seemed as eager to see the merchant elevated as Supaari himself was to be ennobled . Who gained ? he asked himself , standing blindly in the street , oblivious to passersby . Who profited ? Hlavin . His brothers . Their friends . Hlavin must have known Jholaa was too old , must have suggested to Dherai and Bhansaar how amusing it would be if the Darjan lineage were extinguished in its infancy , by its own deluded founderLightheaded with humiliation , Supaari fought nausea and , dearly bought illusions gone , knew with a strange certainty that sickness was not normal for Sandoz 's kind . Courteous and desiring to please , Supaari knew that he himself had invited Hlavin Kitheri 's contempt as unknowingly as Sandoz had invited ... Who shall pay for this ? he thought . And , fury rising to fill the place of shame , he told himself with ugly irony that this was an unfortunate commercial phrasing Seething , he turned back toward the Kitheri lair , his mind black with thoughts of bloody revenge , of challenges and ha'aran duels . But there was no recourse . Wait until the morning and , before witnesses , expose Kitheri duplicity — and listen to the laughter as the plot became merely a joke , played out publicly . Save the child 's life now — and listen to the laughter again someday , when marriage contracts were made to be broken . Alive , beautiful and enchanting , the daughter would end as the mother had : a prop in an elaborate comedy , used to humiliate him for the amusement of the gentry . It 's not that personal , he thought , slowing down , in sight now of the Kitheri compound . It 's not about me . It 's simply my category that is to be kept in place . They need us where we are . Third - born merchants . The Runa . We feed and clothe and shelter them . We provide their needs and their wants and their whims and their desires . We are the foundation of their palace and they dare not let one stone shift , or the whole of it will fall around them . He leaned against a neighbor 's wall , staring at the palisaded enclosure of the family that had ruled Inbrokar for generations , and came finally to a cool familiar place in his heart , where decisions were made without anger or wishes . From long experience , he knew the Pon river barge schedule out of In- 72 Mary Doria Russell brokar 's docks . Supaari VaGayjur considered the bargain he had made and fell back on a merchant 's honor . He had kept his part of the agreement . He owed these people nothing . I will take what is mine , he thought , and go . "
32657	32720	32651	32651	I	0	” REMARKED IRA'IL VRO to the Reshtar of Galatna . Alerted by informants , they had watched Supaari return to the Kitheri compound , moving to a corner tower to observe as the merchant spoke to the midwife in the back courtyard and then left with her and the child . Ira'il faced Hlavin Kitheri , only to confront an unnerving stare . “
32727	33159	32721	32721	You	295	” Ira'il said , voice trailing off uncertainly . Confused , he inhaled guardedly to catch Kitheri 's scent . There was no whiff of anger , but Ira'il turned back to the tower window to cover his unease . He could , by shifting his eyes a bit , pick out the treasury and provincial revenue offices , the state archives and libraries , the arena located only steps from the High Court . The baths , the embassies ; the towering stone pillars , with their silvery cloisonné of radio transmission equipment , rising from the General Command . He knew all the landmarks now and admired the cityscape : a timeless celebration of stability and unchanging balanceBalance ! This was the very thing Ira'il lacked when dealing with the Kitheri Reshtar . Hlavin was third - born and Ira'il a first , but the Kitheri outranked every other family in the Principality of Inbrokar , so using the Reshtar 's name in direct address or deciding who held right to the personal pronoun was a complicated and dangerous task . Without a Runa protocol specialist to advise him , Ira'il felt constantly on the verge of toppling into some unforgivable error . To make matters worse , Ira'il had no idea why he 'd been chosen to accompany the Reshtar from Gayjur to Inbrokar when Hlavin 's exile was suspended for the birth of his sister 's child . Granted , Ira'il had so admired the Reshtar 's extraordinary poetry that he had defied his own family and renounced his right to transmit the Vro patrimony , in order to join the glittering society of Galatna Palace . But other men had done the same , and Ira'il himself was a poor singer who knew just enough about poetry to understand that his own verse would never rise above cliché . The only time he came to the Reshtar 's attention was when he uttered some regrettably obvious praise for another man 's lovely metaphor , or hit the wrong a a CHILDREN OF GOD 73 note in a chorus . So he had been content to sit at the edges of the Reshtar 's court , feeling honored simply to be in the company of such artists . Someone , after all , had to be the audience . Then , inexplicably , Hlavin Kitheri had reached out and pulled Ira'il Vro from obscurity , inviting him to attend the inauguration ceremonies of the extraordinary new Darjan lineage that the Reshtar had permitted to come into existence . "
33170	33182	33163	33163	you	1590	” the Reshtar had insisted when Ira'il had stammered a demurral , “
33212	33331	33332	33332	One	5376	" Ira'il could only presume that the Reshtar enjoyed his company — a startling notion , but irresistibly flattering . Everything about this excursion had been startling , really . Entering Inbrokar for the first time , Ira'il had been amazed by the Kitheri palace , here in the center of the capital . It was architecturally impressive but oddly quiet — very nearly empty , except for the family itself and its domestic staff . Ira'il had expected something more exciting , more alive at the very heart of his culture . ... He turned away from the city and looked down at the kitchen yard and the Runa gate through which the merchant had just left . “
33340	33359	33332	33332	One	5376	” he told the Reshtar then , hoping that Hlavin would forget the earlier use of dominant language . “
33375	33376	33379	33379	he	1592	” “
33382	33388	33379	33379	he	1592	” the Reshtar said serenely . “
33391	33401	33402	33402	I	0	” Ira'il Vro said , flustered into another gaffe . “
33415	33545	33546	33546	I	0	” Of course not , you dolt , Hlavin Kitheri thought , gazing at the other man with something approaching affection , for he did enjoy Vro 's company immensely - particularly the idiot 's clumsy slights and graceless attempts at recovery . There were wondrously comic elements to this entire drama , and it had been fascinating to set it in motion . Supaari means to leave the city , the Reshtar had realized as his ludicrous brother - in - law stole away with his prize like a skulking scavenger , and the radiance that filled Hlavin Kitheri 's soul rivaled those moments when the resolution of an improvised song came to him in midperformance . I could not have planned it more perfectly , he thought . “
33556	33573	33546	33546	I	0	” the Reshtar said then , voice musical and clear , his limpid lavender eyes celestial . “
33615	33630	33605	33605	he	1592	” Ira'il opened his mouth to protest : No , he 's just left . “
33638	33664	33631	33631	I	0	” the Reshtar said again , placing a brotherly arm across the other man 's shoulders and laying his tail cozily atop Vro 's own . “
33669	33698	33667	33667	you	1600	" 8 Inbrokar During the Reign of Ljaat - sa Kitheri a THERE WERE QUESTIONS THAT COULD NOT BE ASKED , AND THE MOST powerful of these was , "
33701	33702	33667	33667	you	1600	" “
33705	33707	33667	33667	you	1600	" and "
33710	33717	33667	33667	you	1600	" were necessary , of course . “
33720	33725	33667	33667	you	1600	" was usually safe . “
33728	33740	33667	33667	you	1600	" was permissible , although it often led to trouble . But “
33743	33822	33825	33826	a tailor	1601	" was so hazardous that Selikat beat him when he used the word . Even as a child , Hlavin had understood that this was her duty . She beat him for his own good : she feared for him , and did not want the best of her students to be made an example of . Better a tutor 's whip than the slow and public extraction of instructive consequences , should any younger brother breathe treason . “
33831	33846	33825	33826	a tailor	1601	" he had demanded at the age of twelve , still fearless and unsubtle . “
33876	34013	33874	33874	Selikat	404	" The tutor hesitated . It was a Reshtar 's fate to observe his elders ' ascendance , all the while knowing that if either proved out sterile or died before breeding , the extra son would step into the vacated position and be accorded the assumption of competence . Not tall but neat and agile , Hlavin was already physically as adept as Dherai , who was destined to be his nation 's champion , should any challenge to the Patrimony be made . And even Jholaa was brighter than Bhansaar , who could remember all that he was taught and apply it , but rarely drew an inference or came to a a 76 Mary Doria Russell conclusion on his own , and who would nevertheless preside one day over Inbrokar 's highest court . “
34022	34046	34047	34047	Ingwy	405	” the Runao told him , her eyes closing and her voice taking on the rhythm if not the melody of the chants . "
34137	34229	34125	34126	the men	5831	" We can not wall ourselves up , ' they said . So Ingwy commanded , ' Let those who are wise decide who among you is too fierce to live , and let those who are strong kill the fierce ones condemned by the wise . ' And because Ch'horil the Elder was strong and Srimat the Younger was wise , from that time on , the first - born males of each sept were charged with combat and ritual killing , the second - born with adjudication and decision . ”
34230	34237	34238	34238	Hlavin	295	“ And do you believe that ? "
34243	34248	34238	34238	Hlavin	295	" Her eyes opened . “
34259	34274	34238	34238	Hlavin	295	” Selikat replied , dropping her tail with a soft and possibly ironic thud . “
34293	34294	34295	34295	You	1615	" "
34314	34356	34311	34311	you	1615	” the child ordered , imperious even then , when it seemed that nothing more awaited him than an exile designed to distract him from futile resentment and dangerous questions . Selikat drew herself up , a person of some dignity . “
34370	34381	34311	34311	you	1615	” the Runao told her charge , calm eyes steady . “
34434	34435	34422	34423	All elements	1622	” “
34440	34458	34459	34460	the boy	1623	“ Ferocity controlled , like a woman in her chamber . ' Or a Reshtar in exile , ”
34479	34544	34463	34463	She	1624	“ Were things ever truly so neat , Selikat ? Even when men keep their place , the ground can split , swallowing towns . What of balance then ? Floods can drown half the population of a CHILDREN OF GOD 77 low - lying province . A city can lie under ash in less time than it takes to sleep off a meal ! "
34545	34546	34459	34460	the boy	1623	" True,"Selikat
34549	34601	34602	34603	The Runao	312	“ And worse : there are those who secretly nurture disputes , unleashing vendettas whenever circumstance favors them . Jealousy exists , and self - seeking ; competition for its own sake . And aggression and anger : the blind , deaf rage to settle something , once and for all . ”
34692	34700	34701	34701	she	404	" In opposition to all that ferocity , ”
34704	34756	34701	34701	she	404	“ there have been great jurists , resourceful diplomats , men whose voices can restore calm and bring others to their senses . You , my lord , are named for the greatest of these : Hlavin Mra , whose wisdom is enshrined in the fundamental law of Inbrokar , whose oratorio “
34762	34781	34701	34701	she	404	” is sung by every breeding male when he comes of age and takes his place in society . ”
34782	34793	34794	34795	his namesake	1629	“ And what if Hlavin Mra had been born third ? ”
34798	34803	34794	34795	his namesake	1629	“ Or even first ? "
34816	34820	34812	34812	she	404	" What if ? "
34825	34828	34812	34812	she	404	“ Why ? "
34991	35007	35008	35008	Hlavin	412	" At least when she screamed , I knew someone was paying attention to me ! "
35033	35056	35016	35016	Selikat	404	“ I am invisible ! I might as well be Jholaa ! Nothing is real here . Everything of importance is elsewhere . "
35376	35399	35362	35362	she	404	“ Do you recall , my lord , that once you asked : And what if Hlavin Mra had been born third ? ”
35409	35413	35406	35406	his	412	“ Even so , "
35420	35586	35406	35406	his	412	" he would have sung . Why did she do it ? he asked himself later . It was , of course , the Runa way to sacrifice themselves for their masters . And in any case , there was less than a season left to Selikat : she was nearly fifty , old even by the stana dards of court Runa . Perhaps she simply hated waste , and knew the end he 'd come to if he could not release what was in him . It was even possible that she wished him happiness , and knew that without music , there would CHILDREN OF GOD 79 be none in his life . . . . Whatever the reason , the Runao who had raised Hlavin Kitheri chose to give him one last gift . Startled by her words , they both fell silent . Listening carefully for the telltale sound of breath caught , they heard footsteps , both knowing the outcome . “
35595	35604	35587	35587	He	1655	” Selikat called as she was taken away , "
35614	36071	35414	35414	Selikat	404	" These were her last words to him , and Hlavin Kitheri did his best to honor them . own ALMOST FROM THE BEGINNING , HE PUT HIMSELF AT RISK . With the focused ferocity of his ancestors , Hlavin Kitheri dismissed the young fools his brothers had tried to stupefy him with , and called instead for physicists , mathematicians , musicians , bards , surrounding himself with anyone of any caste or age grade who could be induced to teach him . He devoured first the bones and meat of rhythm and harmony and imagery . Then , when the most desperate hunger was assuaged , he tasted the delicacies of solfège : pulse , meter , contour , ambitus ; pitch , scale , microtones ; vowel length and stress , the interplay of linguistic and musical structures . Pleased to find so apt a student , his teachers thought him one of their — a theoretician , who would expound on the traditional chants . Naturally , it was a shock when he sang aloud to check his understanding of a canto 's phrasing , and they reported this to the paramountcy , but privately , they accepted it . And , they noted , the Reshtar had a remarkable voice : supple , true , with extraordinary range . A pity really , that it could not be heard more widely ... Soon , however , he dismissed the academics as well and , when he was rid of them , began to produce songs classical in form but unprecedented in content , a poetry without narrative but with a lyricism so compelling and powerful that no one who heard his songs could ever again be ignorant of the hidden treasures and unseen beauties of their world . The VaGayjuri firsts and seconds gathered at his gate to hear him . He permitted this , knowing that they might carry his songs away with them to Piya’ar , to Agardi , to Kirabai and the Outer Islands , to Mo’arl and finally to the capital itself . He wanted to be heard , needed to reach beyond his walls , and did not end his concerts even when he was warned that Bhansaar Kitheri had been dispatched to investigate this innovation . When Bhansaar arrived , Hlavin welcomed him without fear , as though the visit were merely a courtesy call . Selikat had succeeded in beating obliquity into him and , choosing wisely from his seraglio , the Reshtar of 80 Mary Doria Russell Galatna introduced his brother to several remarkable customs and , afterward , feted him with liqueurs and savories that Bhansaar had never tasted the like of . “
36078	36156	35414	35414	Selikat	404	” Bhansaar decided . Somehow , in the midst of all the graceful , clever talk , with poetry that praised his own wisdom and discernment echoing in his mind as he fell asleep each night , it began to seem that there could be no legal reason to silence young Hlavin . Before he left Gayjur , Bhansaar even proposedmore or less on his own — that Hlavin 's concerts be broadcast , like state oratorios . “
36159	36167	35414	35414	Selikat	404	” Bhansaar ruled in his official finding , “
36195	36233	36234	36234	He	1657	” And surely that was a more subversive notion than merely allowing the Reshtar of Galatna to sing his own songs ! What more innocuous pursuit could a Reshtar indulge in than poetry , after all ? a "
36254	36276	36234	36234	He	1657	” Bhansaar reported to his father and brother when he returned to Inbrokar . When they were amused , he insisted , “
36290	37552	37719	37719	My	0	” Thus Hlavin Kitheri was permitted to sing , and in doing so he lured freedom to his prison . Hearing his concerts , staggered by his songs , even firsts and seconds were inspired to shake off the tyranny of genealogy and join him in sublime and scandalous exile , and Galatna Palace became the focus for the gathering of men who would never ordinarily have come together . With his poetry , the Reshtar of Galatna now redefined legal sterility as purity of mind ; cleansing his life of the tainted past and forbidden future , he made it enviable . Others learned to live as he did — on the cusp of experience , existing entirely within moment after ephemeral moment of rarefied sexual artistry , unmuddied by considerations of dynasty . And among them were men who did not simply appreciate Kitheri 's poetry but who were capable themselves of composing songs of startling beauty . These were the children of his soul . He meant no more than this : to be content , to live in the eternal present , triumphant over time : all elements in balance , all things stable , the chaos within him contained and controlled , like a woman in her chamber . And yet , when he had , at last , achieved that very desire , the music began to die in him . Why ? he asked , but there was no one to answer him . He tried at first to fill the void with objects . He had always prized rarity , singularity . Now he sought and collected the finest and oldest , commisCHILDREN OF GOD 81 a a sioned the most costly , the most highly decorated , the most complex . Each new treasure bought a holiday from hollowness , as he studied its intricacies and pored over its nuances , tried to find in it some quality that would summon the light , the flashing brilliance . ... But then he would put the thing aside , the savor gone , the scent dissipated , the silence unbroken . He passed the days pacing and waiting , but nothing would come — nothing ignited any spark of song . His life had begun to seem not a poem but an incoherent collection of words , as random as a Runa domestic 's brainless chatter . What he felt was beyond boredom . It was a dying of the soul . It was a conviction that there was nothing anywhere in his world that could cause him to breathe in a full measure of life again . Into this night , like the gilding of first dawn , came a crystal flask of striking simplicity , containing seven small , brown kernels of extraordinary scent : sweetly camphoric , sugary , spiced — aldehydes and esters and pyrazines released in a sudden jolt of fragrance that rocked him as a volcano 's eruption rocks the ground , which he breathed in , first gasping , then crying out like an infant newly born . With the fragrance filling his head and chest came the knowledge that the world held something new . Something wonderful . Something that drew him back toward life . There was more : syn’amon , the merchant Supaari VaGayjur called the next consignment . Klohv . Vanila . Yeest . Saydj . Ta'im . Koomen . Sohp . And with each astonishing delivery , a promise of the unimaginable : sweat , oil , infinitesimal fragments of skin . Not Jana’ata . Not Runa . Something else . Something other . Something that could not be purchased except in its own coin : life for life . Here then was the complex dance of unprecedented scent and sound and sensation , the superb moment of agonizing sexual tension , the astonishment of unparalleled release . All his life he had sought inspiration in the despised , the unnoticed , the unique , the fleeting ; all his life he 'd believed that each experience , each object , each poem could be selfsufficient , perfect and entire . And yet , eyes still closed in climax , finishing with the foreigner that first time , he realized , Comparison is the source of all significance . How could he have been deaf to this for so long ? Consider pleasure , he thought , as the foreigner was taken away . With a Runa concubine or a captive Jana'ata female , there was inequality of a sort , certainly a basis for comparison , but it was obscured by the element of duty done . Consider power ! To understand power , one had to observe powerlessness . Here , the foreigner was most instructive , even as the in- 82 Mary Doria Russell toxicating scent of fear and blood began to dissipate . No claws , no tail , a laughable dentition , small , imprisoned . Defenseless . The foreigner was the most contemptible of conquests ... ... the embodiment of Zero , the physical manifestation of the starting point of experience ... That night , Hlavin Kitheri lay still on his cushions , meditating on the absence of magnitude , on the cypher that separates positive from negative , on the nothing , on the No Thing . When such comparisons were made , orgasm became as inexhaustibly beautiful as mathematics , its gradations — its inequalities — sublimely arrayed for the highly trained aesthere to recognize and appreciate . Art can not exist without inequality , which is itself established by comparison , he realized . He called for the foreigner again at first light . It was different the second time , and the third . He called together the best of the poets — the most talented , the most perceptive — and , using the foreigner to teach what he had learned , found that the experience was different for each of them . Now he listened with new understanding , and he was entranced by the variety and splendor of their songs . He was wrong about the possibilpure experience — he knew that now ! The individual was a lens through which the past looked on the moment , and changed the future . Even the foreigner was marked , changed , by each episode in a way that Runa concubines , that Jana'ata captives never had been . In the heady days following that first encounter , Hlavin Kitheri produced a philosophy of beauty , a science of art and its creative sources , its forms and its effects . All life could be an epic poem , with each moment 's meaning thrown into relief by the slanting light of past and future , of dusk and dawn . There must be no isolation , no random experience or any singularity ! To raise life to Art , one must classify , compare , rank - appreciate the inequalities so that the superb , the ordinary and the inferior may be known by their contrast . After seasons of silence , the transcendent music of Hlavin Kitheri was heard again in an outpouring of artistic energy that washed over his society like a tidal wave . Even those who had ignored him previously , made uncomfortable by his outrageous interests and extraordinary notions , were now transfixed by the glory he seemed to shine upon unchanging verities . “
37556	37560	37719	37719	My	0	” men cried . “
37591	37686	37719	37719	My	0	” ity of CHILDREN OF GOD 83 In the midst of this ferment , more foreigners came to the gate of Galatna Palace , with a young Runa interpreter named Askama , who said these were members of the foreigner 's family who had come to take him home . Hlavin Kitheri had by that time nearly forgotten the small seed of this vast florescence , but when his secretary approached him , he thought , Let no one be mured up . Let no one be confined by another 's wish or need . “
37695	37718	37719	37720	My lord	1616	” the Reshtar sang out , laughing . Swaying slightly from side to side , afraid to misunderstand , the secretary asked , “
37728	37729	37723	37725	the foreigner Sandoz	1662	" “
37740	37744	37719	37720	My lord	1616	” Kitheri cried . “
37749	37828	37719	37720	My lord	1616	" This , then , was the foreigner 's last service . For Hlavin Kitheri had been born into a society that imprisoned the spirit of all its people , that perpetuated dullness and ineptitude and indolence among the rulers , that enforced passivity among the ruled . Hlavin understood now that the entire structure of Jana'ata society was based on rank , but this was an artificial inequality , propping up the worst and enervating the best . “
37831	37838	37719	37720	My lord	1616	” the Reshtar urged his followers , “
37862	37863	37864	37864	He	1662	" "
37872	38193	37864	37864	He	1662	" men began to say . Perhaps he was . Unblinded by convention , freed from all restraint , having no stake in what was , Hlavin Kitheri conceived of a world where nothing — not ancestry , not birth , not custom - nothing but ability , tested and proven , would determine a man 's place in life . And , briefly , he sang of this with a terrifying grandeur of imagination until his father and brothers realized what he was saying , and forbade the concerts . Who would not have been unbalanced ? To have dreamt of such liberty , to have imagined a world without walls — and then to be imprisoned again ... Hlavin Kitheri had true friends , genuine admirers among the poets , and , some of them stayed on with him in this new and more awful exile . Prudent men , they hoped that he might find a way to be content once more within the small , exquisite territory of Galatna Palace . But when he began to kill the members of his harem one by one , and sat to watch the bodies rot , day after day , the best of them left him , unwilling to witness his descent . Then , the flare of light in the darkness : news that Jholaa had been suc- 84 Mary Doria Russell a cessfully bred and was now carrying , news that the Reshtar of Galatna would be released from his exile and allowed back to Inbrokar City for a short time , to attend the ceremonies marking the inauguration of the Darjan lineage , the naming of his sister 's first child , and the ennobling of the Gayjur merchant who had brought him Sandoz . Hlavin Kitheri had measured and compared and judged the mettle of those who ruled and knew himself unmatched , unfathomed . “
38196	38205	37864	37864	He	1662	" had been answered . All that remained were “
38208	38210	37864	37864	He	1662	" and "
38213	38325	37864	37864	He	1662	" and , knowing this , the Reshtar of Galatna smiled in silent ambush , waiting for the moment to seize liberty . It came when his absurd brother - in - law Supaari VaGayjur left Inbrokar with a nameless infant . That afternoon — with the sudden , certain rapacity of a starved predator - Hlavin Kitheri brought down everyone who stood in his path to power . He spent his final days as Reshtar in a series of death ceremonies for his murdered father and brothers , for his slaughtered nephews and nieces , for his defenseless sister , and the gallant but terribly unfortunate houseguest Ira'il Vro — all “
38341	38762	38763	38764	Don Emilio	418	” Indeed , the entire domestic staff of the Kitheri compound was declared complicit and swiftly killed . Within hours , a writ of VaHaptaa status was laid on Hlavin Kitheri 's fleeing brother - in - law , authorizing summary execution of Supaari VaGayjur and his child , and anyone who aided their escape . . Having swept aside obstacles like so many scythed flowers , Hlavin Kitheri began the elaborate ritual of investiture as forty - eighth Paramount of the Patrimony of Inbrokar , and prepared to set his people free . 9 Naples October - November 2060 a a THE WEATHER THAT OCTOBER WAS DRY AND WARM , AND THIS ALONE was enough to make a difference to Emilio Sandoz . Even after a hard night , sunlight pouring through his windows was curative . Using his hands gingerly because it was impossible to predict what would trigger the pain , he spent the earliest hours of each day neatening the apartment , determined to do as much as he could without anyone else 's collaboration or permission . After such a long seige of invalidism , it was pure pleasure to make a bed and sweep a floor and put away clean dishes on his own . By nine o'clock , unless the dreams had been very bad , he was shaved , showered and dressed , and ready to move to the high , safe ground of solitary research . In his work , he was the technical beneficiary of the nearly extinct American baby boom generation , whose senescence had created a huge a market for equipment that aided the enfeebled and disabled . It took a week to train the system to recognize his speech patterns in the four languages he would use most often during this project , and then almost as long again to learn to subvocalize into the throat mike . Preferring the familiar , he also ordered a virtual keyboard and by the thirteenth of Octoa ber , he had begun to pick up speed using handsets that allowed him to type with barely perceptible movement of the fingers . Robolinguist , he thought that morning , settling in with headset , braces 86 Mary Doria Russell and keyboard gear . Absorbed by the search for hyponyms and collocations in data radioed back from Rakhat , he did n't notice the sound of knocking beyond the earphones , and so he was surprised by a woman 's voice calling , “
38766	38791	38763	38764	Don Emilio	418	” Pulling apparatus off his head and hands , he waited , not quite knowing what to do or say , until he heard , “
38813	38879	38880	38880	I	0	” Deal with it now or deal with it later , he thought . He reached the door just as the child 's piping voice rose in insistence , and opened it to a woman in her thirties who looked harassed and tired , but who had Celestina 's Renaissance angel looks : brown eyes in an ivory oval , wreathed by dark blond curls . “
38887	38905	38880	38880	I	0	” Celestina announced . Sandoz , unamused , looked at her mother and waited for an explanation . "
38926	38953	38914	38914	Celestina	420	” the woman apologized , gesturing impotence in the face a of a juvenile onslaught that he surmised had been going on since the christening party . “
38971	38972	38973	38973	I	0	" “
38983	39004	38980	38981	Signora Giuliani	419	” he said with wry courtesy , remembering Askama — for once with simple affection and no jolt of pain . "
39009	39024	39007	39007	Gina	275	" Celestina 's mother said , dry humor overcoming her discomfort with the situation . “
39054	39062	39051	39051	you	420	" The priest 's eyes widened gratifyingly . “
39068	39069	39051	39051	you	420	" “
39076	39120	39070	39070	Celestina	420	” Gina pulled a coiling strand of hair away from her mouth , blown there by the wind , and automatically did the same for Celestina , trying to make the squirming , resistant child look presentable . It was an uphill battle . “
39131	39132	39128	39129	Don Emilio	418	" “
39147	39152	39133	39133	I	0	” Celestina informed him . “
39168	39175	39164	39164	you	420	” she added as an afterthought . “
39178	39219	39220	39221	Donna Celestina	420	" The mother 's momentary distress registered , but Sandoz sat on the bottom step so he was eye to eye with Celestina , the curling halo around her face bright with the sunlight that fell just beyond his door . “
39244	39252	39240	39242	an elderly gentleman	1675	” he told her with ducal dignity . “
39270	39282	39253	39253	I	0	” CHILDREN OF GOD 87 The child stared at him suspiciously . “
39288	39289	39253	39253	I	0	" “
39302	39319	39320	39320	I	0	” said Gina wearily , having explained all this a hundred times , this morning alone . “
39329	39334	39320	39320	I	0	” Sandoz confirmed regretfully . “
39340	39341	39338	39338	you	420	" “
39348	39368	39338	39338	you	420	” he said . Gina laughed and he glanced up at her , his face grave , eyes alight . “
39375	39389	39390	39390	I	0	” Celestina asked . Holding up four of her own , she said , “
39395	39422	39390	39390	I	0	" , Sandoz held up both hands and slowly opened and closed them eight times , counting for the child in tens as the braces whirred . "
39430	39436	39390	39390	I	0	” said Celestina , impressed . "
39453	39479	39480	39480	You	0	" Celestina mulled this over , twisting a handful of hair around delicate fingers , small wrist braceleted with the last vestiges of baby fat . “
39488	39520	39480	39480	You	0	” she decided finally . He laughed with genuine warmth , but then looked up at Gina Giuliani , the reluctance plain on his face , and shook his head slightly . “
39536	39579	39533	39534	Don Emilio	418	" Gina pleaded , embarrassed but determined , for the Father General had encouraged Celestina 's notion of giving Sandoz a pig on the grounds that caring for the animal would provide a certain amount of physical and emotional therapy . Besides .... “
39625	39626	39614	39614	Carmella	267	" “
39642	39684	39685	39685	We	1680	" He stopped . A classic blunder ! he thought , remembering George Edwards 's advice to Jimmy Quinn at his wedding : Never give a woman reasons that can be argued with . Say no , or prepare for defeat . "
39690	39704	39685	39685	We	1680	” said Celestina , who , at four , already understood the principle . “
39713	39714	39685	39685	We	1680	” “
39721	39740	39685	39685	We	1680	” Gina Giuliani assured him earnestly , her hands on Celestina 's shoulders , holding the child near . “
39774	39789	39766	39766	she	1436	" Seeing Sandoz 's resolve weaken , she pressed her attack with merciless melodrama . "
39814	39833	39834	39834	You	1690	” 88 Mary Doria Russell | 1 1 There was a silence one was tempted to call pregnant . “
39841	39850	39834	39834	You	1690	" Sandoz said at last , eyes narrow . “
39866	39953	39857	39857	you	1690	” Laughing and victorious , Gina led Sandoz to her car , Celestina skipping beside them . Opening the back door , Gina reached in and passed the priest a bag of kibble , heedless of his hands , which she had decided to ignore . He juggled the bag ineptly for a moment , but managed to get a secure grip on it as Celestina chattered about how to hold and feed and water the animal , and told him that its mother was Cleopatra . "
39966	39992	39857	39857	you	1690	” Gina remarked very quietly , so Celestina would n't hear and demand an explanation . She lifted the cage out of the back seat . “
39995	40017	39857	39857	you	1690	” Sandoz said , equally quiet for the same reason , as they began the short walk back to his apartment . “
40041	40050	40024	40024	Elizabeth	348	” Gina laughed , but he warned her , “
40073	40129	40059	40059	I	0	" They went upstairs and settled Elizabeth into her new home . The pig enclosure was a simple affair of lath and chicken wire , made to fit around a plastic orange crate . There was an overturned vegetable bin for the little animal to hide in . The cage was open at the top . “
40136	40193	40059	40059	I	0	" Sandoz asked , sitting down and peering at the pig : an oblong lump of golden hair , with a white saddle and blaze , the size and approximate shape of a cobblestone . Its front end , he observed , distinguished from the back mainly by two wary eyes , bright as jet beads . "
40206	40253	40194	40194	You	1692	” Gina said as she knelt to attach a filled water bottle to the cage . She lifted the animal momentarily so he could inspect the absurd little legs that supported the pig 's solid bulk and then she went to his kitchen for a dishcloth . “
40269	40278	40279	40279	She	1436	” she said , handing him the cloth . "
40286	40299	40279	40279	She	1436	” Celestina told him as he accepted the animal from her mother . “
40303	40304	40301	40301	she	1436	” “
40320	40331	40310	40310	I	0	” Gina said smoothly , sitting in the other chair . "
40338	40345	40310	40310	I	0	" Celestina told him , relentless . “
40355	40359	40352	40353	my daughter	1670	” Gina said . “
40444	40492	40430	40430	she	348	” He looked down at the animal , which was instinctively trying to appear rocklike and decidedly inedible , in case an eagle flew overhead . There was a little V of black marking her forehead between silly folded - over ears the shape of scallop shells . “
40500	40553	40430	40430	she	348	" he said quietly . He retained feeling in the outer edges of his hands , where the nerves had not been severed , and now used an exposed section of his smallest finger to stroke the pig 's back from blunt head to tailless behind , a short but silken distance . “
40569	40579	40580	40580	I	0	” he said severely , looking at the mother . “
40592	40593	40588	40590	a purchasing agent	1706	” “
40597	40602	40588	40590	a purchasing agent	1706	” Gina said hurriedly . “

40679	40712	40713	40713	I	0	” He carefully lifted the pig from his lap and put her back into the enclosure on the floor . The animal shot under the vegetable bin and remained there , motionless . “
40725	40731	40723	40723	signora	1692	” he said , straightening . “
40738	40743	40723	40723	signora	1692	” She looked surprised . “
40754	40764	40749	40749	you	0	" she said , gesturing at the sound equipment . “

40830	40847	40769	40769	signora	1692	” Gina rolled her eyes , still amazed herself that the dispute had come to this . “
40895	40899	40954	40955	the bishops	1719	” Sandoz grimaced . “
40934	40935	40892	40892	my	0	” "
40944	40949	40892	40892	my	0	" Gina told him . "
41000	41008	41011	41012	John Candotti	378	" He shook his head and shrugged . “
41041	41049	41020	41020	He	378	” Gina smiled , her eyes amused . “

41111	41123	41066	41067	a Giuliani	275	” Emilio said , coming back to the more immediate problem , “
41175	41222	41226	41226	they	1726	” Johannes Voelker , the Father General 's private secretary , had brought this to everyone 's attention . The Father General was intensely annoyed by the reasoning but Voelker , a man of rigid principle , had insisted on Sandoz 's right to the income . “
41232	41233	41226	41226	they	1726	" “
41237	41259	41226	41226	they	1726	” she said , a little distracted as Celestina left the guinea - pig cage and moved off toward the photonics . “
41278	41279	41271	41271	You	418	" “
41300	41306	41307	41307	I	0	" He cleared his throat . “

41345	41390	41339	41339	I	0	” She was touched that he would ask her to do this for him , but kept her face businesslike , running her eyes over him with a tailorly efficiency , as though she did this kind of thing for priests all the time . “

41860	41941	41858	41858	signora	1692	” he assured her and , face unreadable , helped shepherd the child down the stairs and out the door . They walked down the driveway together , the adults ' silence decently covered by the little girl 's prattle , until they reached the car . There , ciaos and grazies were exchanged as he opened doors for the ladies with the deliberate and stately dexterity the braces permitted and enforced . As they drove away , he yelled , “
41953	41968	41838	41841	a woman of action	1741	” Gina laughed and waved an arm out the window , without looking back . “
41979	42061	41976	41977	a fool	1744	” he said softly , and turned toward the garage , where his work was waiting . HE SETTLED INTO A ROUTINE AS THE MILD NEAPOLITAN AUTUMN SET IN and the rains became more frequent . As promised , Elizabeth was an undemanding companion who quickly took on the size and proportions of a hairy brick and greeted his morning stirring with cheerful whistling . 92 Mary Doria Russell Never good company at dawn , he would call from his bed , “
42083	42716	42717	42717	Elizabeth	348	" But he took her out to eat a carrot on his lap while he drank his coffee and , after a while , hardly felt foolish at all when he talked to her . Guinea pigs were , he discovered , crepuscular : quiet at night and during the day , active at dawn and dusk . The pattern suited him . He often worked nonstop from eight until past five , unwilling to pause until the pig whistled quitting time as the light diminished . He was aware , always , that his progress could be interrupted by the debilities he 'd accumulated on Rakhat and in the months of malnutrition during the solitary voyage home . So he concentrated as long as he could and then made himself a supper of red beans and rice , which he ate with Elizabeth 's beady eyes on him . Afterward , he would take her out and sit with her , numbed fingertips idly stroking her back as the little animal nestled down and slept the brief , uneasy sleep of prey . And then he went back to work , often until past midnight , the overarching structure of K’San — the language of the Jana'ata — becoming plain to him now , and increasingly beautiful : no longer solely the instrument of terror and degradation . Hour after hour , the rhythm of search and comparison , the patient accretion of pattern pulled him along , its inherent fascination sufficient to defend against both memory and anticipation . In late October , John tactfully informed him of the impending arrival of the other priests who were to be trained for the second Jesuit mission to Rakhat . They had all read the first mission 's written reports and scientific papers , John said , and they 'd already worked through Sofia Mendes 's introductory Al language - instruction system and had begun studying Ruanja on their own . And each had been thoroughly briefed about Sandoz 's experiences by the Father General , and by John himself . John did n't say it in so many words , but Emilio understood that the new men had been warned : Do n't touch him , do n't mother him , do n't play therapist . Just follow his lead and get on with the work . Emilio made little effort to get to know the new men , preferring to confer in cyberspace , buffered by machinery , or in the library , which he could leave when he needed to . But he broke his self - imposed solitude with trips to the kitchen to collect vegetable parings from Brother Cosimo for Elizabeth . And Gina Giuliani stopped by on Fridays , always with Celestina , to drop off pig supplies and sometimes other small items he could bring himself to ask for . She and John Candotti had a knack for helping him without making him feel helpless , and for this he was grateful beyond CHILDREN OF GOD 93 words . Heads together over lunch one Friday afternoon , the three of them had analyzed the apartment and Emilio 's daily tasks . When Gina could n't find ready - made items that suited his disabilities , John would make them : counterweights for things he needed to lift , utensils with broad handles , plumbing and door hardware that was simpler to operate , clothing that was easier to manage . On November 5 , 2060 , which was — as far as he knew - more or less the , — occasion of his forty - seventh birthday , Emilio Sandoz poured himself a glass of Ronrico after his usual dinner of beans and rice . “
42719	42727	42717	42717	Elizabeth	348	” he announced , glass held high , “
42746	42984	42717	42717	Elizabeth	348	" He went back to work , his mind occupied with a K’San semantic field having to do with river systems that the Basque ecologist had suggested might be related to words used in reference to ranked political alliances . Like a series of tributaries ! Emilio thought , and felt once more the strangely visceral thrill of trying to disprove a hypothesis he suspected was robust . a 10 Pon River , Central Province , Inbrokar 2046 , Earth - Relative THE HEAT BROKE ON THE THIRD DAY SOUTH WITH A STORM THAT drenched the passengers on the river barge and sent sheetfloods a handsbreadth deep across the flats . Accustomed to the ways of the village Runa , Supaari VaGayjur stripped off his sodden city robes and , for the balance of the trip , went nearly as naked as his practical companions did . With his clothes , he stripped away the stink of Inbrokar , and felt real again . It 's over , Supaari thought , and there was no regret in him . He had been close enough to his life 's ambition to see what he was buying and to reckon the cost of living it out , snared in the twisted skein of aristocratic alliances , hatreds and resentments . With a merchant 's certainty , he cut his losses , slicing through the tangle with a single word : "
42987	43430	43431	43432	Such hunters	1750	” So Supaari VaGayjur had walked away from the Kitheri compound without bothering to tell anyone he was going . He took only what was of value to him and to no one else — the child , who was at that moment being dangled over the edge of the barge , piss flying into the wake . Paquarin had agreed to make the trip south with him as far as Kirabai , and she laughed now , swooping the baby through the water to clean her . She 'll sleep now , he thought , smiling as the look of outraged startlement on the howling infant 's face was replaced with drowsy contentment in Paquarin 's lap , the Runao 's fine hands stroking and soothing her . Leaning against a transport basket of sweetleaf , drowsy himself , he CHILDREN OF GOD 95 a a watched the riverbanks slide by and wondered idly why the Jana'ata insisted on clothing bodies protected by dense coats of hair . Anne Edwards had asked him that once and he had n't had a good answer for her , except to observe that the Jana'ata generally preferred elaborate to plain . Almost dozing as he dried in the breeze , it came to him that the purpose of clothing was neither protection nor decoration but distinction — to mark off military first from bureaucratic second and both of those from academic or commercial third , to keep everyone in his proper position so that greetings were correctly measured and deference appropriately apportioned . And to put distance between the rulers and the ruled , he realized , so that no Jana'ata would be mistaken for a Runa domestic ! Eyes closed , he smiled to himself , pleased to answer Ha'an at last . Until the extraordinarily polymorphic foreigners pointed it out to him , Supaari himself had never wondered about the uncanny similarity between Jana'ata and Runa . Had n't even noticed it , really — one might as well ask why rain is the same color as water — but it intrigued the foreigners . Once , while in residence with Supaari in Gayjur , Sandoz had suggested that in ancient times , the resemblance between the two species had been less , but the Runa had somehow caused the Jana'ata to become more like themselves . Predator mimicry , Sandoz called it . Supaari had been greatly offended by the notion that the most successful Jana'ata hunters preying on Runa herds might have been those who looked and smelled most like Runa — who could approach the herds without alarming them . "
43444	43448	43449	43449	Their	1750	" Sandoz said . “
43477	43478	43479	43479	Sandoz	261	" "
43485	43491	43479	43479	Sandoz	261	" Supaari had told him . “
43523	43541	43542	43542	We	1754	” Now Supaari admitted to himself that there might be some truth in what Sandoz had suggested . “
43547	43742	43743	43744	the child	923	” his Runa secretary Awijan had told him once . At the time , Supaari had dismissed the remark as irony , but Jana'ata babies were raised by Runa nurses , and it was a sort of taming ... He slept then and , in his dream , stood at the entrance to a cave . In the way of dreams , he knew somehow that the passage before him led to caverns . He took a single step forward but lost his way immediately , and became more and more lost — and woke to the nuptial bellows of o6 Mary Doria Russell white - necked cranil lumbering in the shallows . Disturbed and anxious , he scrambled to his feet , and tried to shake off the unease by walking around the pilothouse to watch the animals roll together in titanic earnest , and to wish them good fortune , whatever that might be for cranil . When he looked back toward his daughter , sleeping curled next to Paquarin , he thought , I have taken a step into the cave , and I am carrying the child with me . Not “
43746	44183	43743	43744	the child	923	” My child . My daughter , he thought . There was no one to discuss her naming with . By custom , a first daughter would take an unused name from among the dead of the dam 's lineage . Supaari had no wish to commemorate anyone from Jholaa 's family , so he tried to remember names of his own mother 's ancestors , and realized with dismay that he did n't know any . A third who , it was presumed , would never breed , Supaari had not been told the names of the old ones ; or , if he had been told , he did not remember any . Having no fixed notion of what he would do next , beyond leaving Inbrokar with his child alive and intact , Supaari had decided to go home to Kirabai . He would ask his mother to choose a name , and hoped that his request would please her . Filling his lungs with air that carried nothing of cities , he thought , Everything is different now . And yet , the scents of home were the same . The horizon was blurred with redbush pollen , visible in the slanting light of second sundown — a haze of fragrance rising off the ground . Where the riverland flattened , and the water widened and slowed , lazy winds brought the familiar medicinal vapor of grass digested : the strangely clean smell of piyanot dung . And there was the peppery tang of green melfruit a few days before ripening , and the pungent smokiness of datinsa past its peak . All that welcomed him and his daughter , and he slept on deck that night , dreamless and content . He roused on the fourth day south to a stirring among the passengers as the barge approached the Kirabai bridge ; many would stop here overnight to trade . Supaari stood and told Paquarin to gather up their baggage and get ready to disembark , and began to brush himself down clumsily . Without his asking , a Runa trader stepped forward to join Paquarin in unpacking Supaari 's best clothes and , chatting , helped with his laces and the overrobe buckles . Glad to be done with the forced hauteur of Inbrokar , Supaari thanked them both . A small , strong excitement rose in him - optimism , pent - up energy , a gladness to be home . He turned to Paquarin and held out his own arms for the baby , careless of his finery . “
44188	44205	44186	44186	child	1094	” he said , as the barge passed CHILDREN OF GOD 97 under graceless limestone arches . “
44239	44276	44277	44277	I	0	” Her eyes widened , but only because the barge had moved from sunlight to the shadow beneath the bridge . Supaari lifted her to a shoulder and breathed in the musty infant sweetness of her . “
44300	44305	44277	44277	I	0	” he whispered wryly . “
44364	44384	44351	44354	Your father 's family	1769	” But we do n't murder children with deceit , he thought as the barge reemerged into the light . "
44398	44410	44396	44396	lord	5712	” the Runa barge owner called to him from the pilothouse . “
44418	44419	44412	44412	you	5712	” "
44422	44437	44412	44412	you	5712	" Supaari said , elated by the sight and smell and sound of Kirabai . "
44442	44969	44438	44438	We	1761	" Outwardly serene , he handed the baby back to Paquarin as the barge was poled to a halt , watching as huge braided tie lines were thrown over the pilings . He searched faces and tasted windborne scents among the carriers on the dock but found no kin to people he 'd known as a boy , so he pressed past the Runa crowd declaring cargo and paying dock fees , and hired a Runao at random for the baggage , even though there was not much baggage and he did not have a great deal to spend on pride . He had been driven from Kirabai with almost nothing , but he 'd built a trading company that generated money as the plains breed grass ; he had known wealth and had thought sometimes , in the dark hours when sleep would not come , of returning home in luxury and triumph . Instead , he had surrendered all his assets to the state treasury when he took his place as Founder . Now he was arriving on a freight barge no better than the one he 'd left on , with nothing to show for his striving but a nameless baby and six hundred bahli — all he had after selling his jewelry at the Inbrokar dock to hire Paquarin and buy her passage on the barge . So he had dressed in his best and hired a bearer , hoping to make a good first impression , and wished his claws were longer . The child is worth the price , he thought , mercantile and unashamed . I can make money again . The hostelry was visible from the docks , squatting astride an elongated a 98 Mary Doria Russell a hill that rose above the high - water mark of the river . Yesterday 's storm had been stronger here than upriver and , as Supaari led his little entourage through the main gate and beyond the central plaza , up a mesh of narrow walkways lined by the limestone houses of the VaKirabai Runa , they had to step over roof tiles and broken hlari branches . The radio tower had blown over and , in the grove near the bridge , several big marhlar had tumbled into the river , their roots pulled loose from the banks . But storm damage aside , the town of Kirabai itself seemed almost untouched by the years of his absence ... Of course , he was used to the rushing energy of Gayjur and the cramped intrigue of Inbrokar — it was natural that Kirabai seemed lethargic to him . Still , this was a bridgehead for the eastern rakar fields , a reasonably important trading center for inland harvesters . And there were the Runa weaving cooperatives , and the khaliat factories . There is a lot I can do here , Supaari thought , refusing to be discouraged . The doorkeeper at the hostelry compound was new , but the gate itself was not , and Supaari noted with some dismay that it still needed the upper hinge repaired . "
44974	44991	44438	44438	We	1761	" he cried to the Runa porter , smiling in anticipation of his parents ' surprise . "
45000	45108	44996	44996	visitors	1775	" Without a word , the Runao left them standing in the courtyard . A long silence ensued and when Paquarin looked at him inquiringly , Supaari dropped his tail in a gesture of ignorance . After a time , he called out a greeting and listened for voices , hoping to hear someone familiar . No one answered . Puzzled , Supaari began to look around . There was plenty of room for travelers ' equipage in the courtyard , but evidently no one was in residence . Normal for the season , of course . Most Jana'ata traveled in early Fra’an before the heat set in- “
45132	45150	45151	45151	People	950	” He whirled , too startled by his mother 's voice to be wounded by her words . “
45166	45193	45194	45194	I	0	” the old woman snarled , glaring at the baby , who was awake now and making small sounds as she rooted near Paquarin 's neck . “
45304	45317	45318	45319	The Prefect	1782	” she snapped at Paquarin , as the baby began to keen . “
45383	45540	45541	45541	Nobody	5860	" Speechless , Supaari followed his mother into the shade of the gallery along the riverward wall of the house , where the breeze was best . He asked her to sit , but she ignored him , sweeping from one end of the arcade to the other , veil askew , skirts gathering a cargo of dust and leaves and fallen hlari blossoms . Paquarin settled into a corner with the baby and got out the last of the pureed meat , methodically dipping a delicate finger into the paste and holding it to the child 's lips . Supaari took a place on the cushions near the cool stone of the wall and watched his mother , grayed and shrunken , as she paced and ranted . At last , his father appeared , coming around the back of the pumphouse with a Runa do - all , whom he dismissed with a grunt . “
45561	45575	45550	45551	the Prefect	1782	” Enrai sighed , hardly glancing at Supaari and ignoring the baby entirely . “
45605	45650	45601	45601	I	0	” He collapsed onto a cushion at some distance from Supaari and stared out at the river , gleaming like gold foil in the brazen light of three suns . It was quiet , now that the old woman had gone into the house . "
45657	45664	45651	45652	Your brothers	1808	” Enrai said after a time . “
45714	45730	45731	45731	She	1146	" He half - turned toward the kitchen and shouted again for meat before muttering , “
45743	45896	45738	45739	You brats	1814	” Waiting to be fed , the hosteler passed the time as his wife had , with a flow of democratic rancor that took in the living and the dead , the near and the distant , the known and the unknown alike . When Supaari 's elder brothers appeared , they joined in with a complicated tale of feuds and rivalries , as intense as they were petty . In the midst of it all , an adolescent Runao appeared with a platter of meat , holding it at arm 's length , moving sideways so it remained downwind . Only Supaari looked at her . A VaKashani villager , he realized , but I OO Mary Doria Russell a could n't quite recall her family . He rose and took the platter from the girl , murmuring a greeting in Ruanja . She was about to speak when Enrai sneered , “
45925	45996	45917	45917	We	1817	” So she sank in an awkward curtsy , the movement still new to her , and hurried back into the kitchen . Rigid , Supaari stood silently for a moment , then placed the platter on the low table as his brothers laughed . He returned to his place on the cushions , and it was a long while before his eldest brother noticed that Supaari had not eaten . “
46005	46023	45997	45997	You	1815	" Laalraj said , waving the back of his hand toward the meal . But he added , “
46034	46035	45917	45917	We	1817	” "
46042	46050	45917	45917	We	1817	” his brother Vijar asked , chewing . "
46051	46057	46058	46058	Supaari	286	“ Tomorrow at second dawn , ”
46198	46210	46211	46212	a neighbor	5999	“ The Triple Alliance has been a mistake from the start , "
46221	46245	46211	46212	a neighbor	5999	" We need combat like Runa need good fodder . We 've all degenerated , waiting out these years . Idleness and decay ... "
46368	46640	46641	46642	This one	1436	" . CHILDREN OF GOD IOI The chants began as the light of second sundown burned away , voices raised in ancient harmonies as the neighbors left for home and his brothers prepared to sleep . Supaari 's earliest memories were of hearing these songs at sunset , chest tight , his throat gripped by silence . The truest beauty he had known as the founder of a new lineage was joining the Inbrokar choirs at sunset ; it was a joy surpassing even the announcement of Jholaa 's pregnancy . He now held legal right to take the part of Eldest , but on this evening , Supaari was as silent as the Runa domestics cowering in the kitchen . I will sing again , he promised himself . Not here , not among these benighted , spiteful fools . But somewhere , I will sing again . HE BOARDED THE BARGE THE NEXT MORNING LIKE A MAN SNEAKING OUT of a city on the rumor of plague : fortunate to escape , but full of contemptuous pity for those left behind . Paquarin , distressed by the hostility around her , had begged him not to make her go further , so he 'd endorsed her travel permit and left her with enough money to stay in Kirabai until the next northbound barge went by . With his last three hundred bahli , he bought the VaKashani Runao 's labor from Enrai , promising the girl that he 'd return her to Kashan if she 'd take care of the baby for him until he found a permanent nursemaid . “
46649	46669	46647	46647	lord	5712	” she reminded Supaari after a few quiet hours on the barge , touching both hands to her forehead . “
46689	46741	46742	46742	Kinsa	438	" Why am I so different ? he had been thinking , blunted hands resting on the rail as he watched the river . All the world thinks one way and I think another . Who am I to judge it wrong ? At the girl 's words , he turned . "
46751	46763	46764	46764	Sipaj	311	” Her scent had changed since he 'd met her last . "
46768	46772	46766	46766	Kinsa	438	” he said , "
46777	46839	46840	46840	Sipaj	311	” She brightened at the sound of her own language , and her natural cheerfulness reasserted itself . After all , Supaari VaGayjur was known to her from birth , had traded with her village for years ; she trusted him . Lucky child , he thought for one wistful moment . Your people will be happy to touch you again . “
46852	47105	46846	46846	we	1839	" Kinsa pressed . Not knowing what to answer , he held out his arms and , unslinging the baby from her back , Kinsa handed the child to him . He smiled . Kinsa had 102 Mary Doria Russell been among the Jana'ata for so short a time , it still seemed normal for a father to carry his own infant . Holding the baby to his chest as shamelessly as a male Runao , Supaari began to walk the perimeter of the barge . I do n't know what I 'm doing anymore , he told his daughter with his heart . I do n't know what life I 'm making for us . I do n't know where we will live or whom you can marry . I do n't even know what to call you . Leaning back against a railing , he settled the child into the crook of his arm . For a time , his eyes left his daughter 's face and came to rest on the far south , where river mist met rain , where there was no certain difference between sky and water , and felt again the dream 's sensation of wandering . I am a foreigner in my own country , he thought , and so is my daughter . Like Ha’an ! he thought then , for of all the foreigners , Anne Edwards was most vivid to him . In K’San , the sound was good : Haʼanala . "
47112	47284	47106	47106	Her	1841	” he said aloud . And he blessed his child : May you be like Ha'an , who was a foreigner here but who had no fear . He was pleased with the name , happy to have the matter settled . The world seemed full of possibilities as he watched the riverbanks move past . He had contacts , knowledge . I wo n't sell to the Reshtar again , he thought , wanting nothing more to do with Hlavin Kitheri — no matter how well he paid . He remembered that he 'd once considered opening a new office in Agardi . Yes , he thought . I 'll try Agardi next . There are different cities . There can be new names . And later on , quietly , so as not to alarm Kinsa or the others , he did what no Jana'ata father had ever done before : he sang the evening chant to his : daughter . To Haʼanala . 11 Naples October - December 2060 "
47292	47298	47289	47290	FATHER GENERAL	5329	” DANIEL IRON HORSE ARGUED . “
47333	47334	47335	47335	Sandoz	261	” “
47340	47354	47355	47355	You	1844	” Vincenzo Giuliani told the father superior of the second mission to Rakhat . “
47365	47701	47355	47355	You	1844	” The rest of the problems or the rest of the crew ? Danny wondered as he left Giuliani 's office that afternoon . Walking down the echoing stone hallway toward the library , he snorted : same thing . Laying aside the question of Sandoz 's participation for the time being , Danny was less than confident about any of the men he 'd be risking his life with . They were all bright , and they were all big ; that much was clear . For the past year , Daniel Beauvais Iron Horse , Sean Fein and Joseba Urizarbarrena had worked to develop proficiencies that might prove critical on Rakhat : communications procedures , first aid , survival skills , dead reckoning , even VR flight training so that any of them could , in an emergency , pilot the mission lander . Each of them was thoroughly familiar with the first mission 's daily reports and scientific papers . Having worked through Sofia Mendes 's introductory Al language - instruction system , they had all studied Ruanja on their own , and had now converged on Naples to work directly with Sandoz on advanced Ruanja and basic K’San . Joseba was solid , and Danny understood why an ecologist had been assigned to the 104 Mary Doria Russell a team , but no matter how much money the Company might be able to make by bringing back Rakhati nanotechnology , Sean Fein was a chronic pain in the ass , and Danny could think of a hundred other men who 'd be better suited for the mission . John Candotti , by contrast , was a hell of a nice guy and very good with his hands , but he had no scientific expertise at all , and he was months behind the others in training . The Father General , no doubt , had his reasons — usually at least three for every move he made , Danny had observed . “
47719	47868	47713	47715	an old man	1848	” Danny would recite dutifully whenever he found himself thoroughly mystified , but he kept his eyes open , watching for clues as he and the others settled into an efficient working routine . Mornings were devoted to language training , but afternoons and evenings were given over to further study of the first mission 's records under Sandoz 's direction , and it was during these sessions that Danny began to see why Giuliani remained adamant that Sandoz would be an asset . Danny himself had all but memorized the first mission 's reports , but he was constantly startled by his own misinterpretations of events , and found Sandoz 's memories and knowledge invaluable . Nevertheless , there were days at a time when the man was incapacitated for one reason or another , and Danny 's own questions about the Jana'ata triggered the strongest reactions . "
47882	47889	47894	47894	Father	378	” Danny reported in late November . “
47921	47922	47923	47923	He	261	” "
47928	47933	47923	47923	He	261	” Giuliani said carefully . "
47997	47998	47999	48002	The people he knew	1851	" “
48033	48034	48035	48035	He	261	” "
48042	48046	48040	48040	Danny	385	” Giuliani insisted . “
48063	48067	48054	48054	him	261	” he added . “
48080	48087	48054	48054	him	261	” CHILDREN OF GOD 105 a a "
48100	48110	48090	48090	YOU	1854	” EMILIO SANdoz repeated each time he was asked . “
48138	48186	48132	48132	I	0	” Nor had Sandoz reconsidered his decision to leave the Society of Jesus , although this was not being made easy for him . His resignation was a private matter of conscience and should have been a straightforward administrative procedure , but when he signed the necessary papers “
48190	48378	48379	48379	My	0	” and sent them to the Father General 's Rome office in late September , they were returned - weeks later — with a memo telling him that his full signature was required . Once more , he took up the pen that Gina had brought , him one Friday , its grip designed for stroke victims whose dexterity was as impaired as his own , and spent his evenings in painful practice . Not surprisingly , another month passed without the new paperwork being forwarded from Rome for signing . He found Giuliani 's delaying tactics first tiresome and then infuriating , and ended them by sending a message to Johannes Voelker asking him to inform the Father General that Dr. Sandoz planned to be too sick to work until the papers arrived . The documents were hand - delivered the next morning by Vincenzo Giuliani himself . The meeting in the Father General 's Naples office was brief and intense . Afterward , Sandoz strode to the library , stood still until he had the attention of all four of his colleagues , and snapped , “
48385	48386	48387	48388	SOMEONE ELSE	1857	" "
48395	48441	48387	48388	SOMEONE ELSE	1857	” SANDOZ TOLD CANDOTTI tightly , tossing a small stack of papers down onto the wooden table where John sat with Danny Iron Horse . At the bottom of each sheet , in unhandy cursive , was a reasonably legible signature : Emilio José Sandoz . "
48466	48541	48454	48454	you	1858	” Sean Fein had been examining Sandoz 's personal photonics rig , but now he studied Candotti , as did Joseba Urizarbarrena , leaning against a half wall that separated the apartment from the stairway to the garage . Danny Iron Horse also glanced at John but said nothing , watching Sandoz move from place to place in the bare room , angry and keyed up . John 's eyes dropped under the scrutiny . “
48547	48548	48542	48542	I	0	" “
48552	48556	48542	48542	I	0	” Sandoz snapped . “
48636	48646	48630	48630	I	0	” he said , eyes sweeping over them all . “
48661	48662	48649	48649	I	0	” “
48694	48700	48684	48684	we	1867	” Danny pointed out amiably . “
48708	48744	48705	48705	your	0	” The guinea pig , aroused by Emilio 's pacing , began to whistle shrilly . He went to the kitchen and got a piece of carrot , hardly aware of what he was doing . “
48755	48771	48705	48705	your	0	” he said , dropping the carrot into the cage . Iron Horse smiled humorlessly . “
48802	48803	48804	48804	He	1869	" “
48816	48827	48804	48804	He	1869	” Sean added , around a thin - lipped smile . “
48843	48858	48860	48860	you	1871	” Sandoz stood still and looked at Danny and then Sean for a moment . “
48870	48890	48862	48863	Johannes Voelker	422	" John Candotti sat up straighter , hearing that , but before he could say anything , Sandoz continued . “
48948	48949	49014	49014	ace	1870	” “
48962	48995	48910	48910	them	1872	” Joseba remarked , satisfied . But he made no move to leave . Danny Iron Horse , too , settled in , making himself comfortable somehow in the little wooden chair . “
49003	49008	48910	48910	them	1872	” he asked Sandoz . "
49016	49017	49014	49014	ace	1870	" “
49024	49030	49020	49020	I	0	” There was a silence . “
49049	49056	49038	49038	I	0	” Sandoz continued with airy bravado . “
49077	49078	49079	49079	Emilio	261	" "
49083	49101	49102	49102	Gentlemen	5225	” John started , but Sandoz ignored him , pulling himself erect , the Spaniard in ascendance . “
49104	49115	49102	49102	Gentlemen	5225	” he said , returning to the issue at hand , “
49143	49151	49130	49130	you	5225	" Danny Iron Horse shrugged , unconcerned . “
49173	49231	49165	49165	I	0	” He glanced , brows up , at the others , who nodded their agreement , then returned his gaze to Sandoz . There was a single uneven breath , a slight diminution of the rigidity . Sandoz stood still for another few moments and then sat on the edge of his bed , silent and staring . “
49235	49271	49165	49165	I	0	” Danny observed after a time . Taken by surprise , Sandoz gave a sort of gasping laugh and looked down : blue jeans , a white shirt with narrow blue stripes . Nothing black . “
49277	49285	49272	49273	Signora Giuliani	419	" he told them self - consciously . “
49300	49311	49293	49293	she	1879	” Glad of the change in subject , John said , “
49322	49382	49314	49314	they	1880	” Of course , almost anything would have looked big on Sandoz 's fleshless frame , John realized with a start . Emilio had always been small , but now he looked wasted again — almost as bad as when he first got out of the hospital . Apparently following the same line of thought , Iron Horse remarked , “
49395	49396	49393	49393	ace	1870	” “
49401	49408	49393	49393	ace	1870	” Emilio said irritably , standing . “
49422	49469	49470	49470	I	0	” He went to the wall of sound - analysis equipment , evidently dismissing them . Joseba stood and Sean moved toward the stairs . John rose as well , but Danny Iron Horse sat there like a pile of rocks , hands behind his head . “
49481	49499	49500	49500	You	1881	” he said , looking Emilio over with canny black eyes , small in the pitted face . “
49503	49530	49500	49500	You	1881	" John tried to wave Danny away from an injudicious display of solicitude , but Sandoz pivoted on a heel , and said with brittle clarity , “
49559	49560	49549	49549	I	0	” "
49574	49579	49566	49566	I	0	” Danny said agreeably . “
49630	49631	49612	49613	Anne Edwards	301	” “
49636	49648	49634	49634	Danny	385	” Sean burst out , as Joseba stared and John cried , “
49665	49666	49660	49660	you	385	" “
49680	49681	49675	49675	I	0	" “
49690	49698	49682	49682	They	1885	” Sandoz said , his color vanishing . “
49714	49715	49712	49712	they	1885	" “
49720	49731	49732	49732	You	385	” John said , shooting a murderous glare at Danny . “
49767	49784	49747	49747	They	1885	" Danny shrugged , getting to his feet , and waved the idea off as well . “
49798	49802	49838	49839	My God	1886	” he said . “
49808	49829	49804	49804	I	0	" But it was too late . There was a thin gasp as the full weight of it hit Sandoz . "
49854	49855	49850	49850	she	420	” “
49860	49867	49868	49868	Emilio	261	” John moaned , and pleaded , “
49883	49927	49928	49928	I	0	" But by the time he got across the room , Sandoz had already fallen apart and there was nothing anyone could do but wait it out : Joseba and Sean acutely uncomfortable , Iron Horse sitting hugely in the little wooden chair . "
49944	49949	49950	49950	John	378	" Sandoz was sobbing . “
49955	49956	49950	49950	John	378	” “
49963	49978	49950	49950	John	378	” John snapped , kneeling next to him , unfriendly eyes on Iron Horse . “
50059	50075	50053	50053	Emilio	261	” Sandoz held his breath , tried to slow himself down , tried to think . "
50116	50117	50100	50100	He	1895	” "
50125	50129	50100	50100	He	1895	" John insisted . “
50142	50326	50137	50137	You	261	" Joseba and Sean looked at each other , eyes wide , and then let out breath that had been trapped in their lungs for what felt like hours . Released from embarrassed immobility , Joseba found a glass and brought some water ; Sean looked around for tissues and settled for handing Sandoz some toilet paper . With John still at his side , Emilio blew his nose awkwardly and sucked in a deep breath , getting shakily to his feet . Wrung out , he went to the table , sat abruptly in the chair opposite Danny and put his head down . For a while , the room was quiet , and John Candotti , for one , spent the time mentally composing a venomous letter of admonition to the Father General regarding his brother in Christ , Daniel Iron Horse , who seemed neither surprised nor notably remorseful about what he 'd triggered , and CHILDREN OF GOD 109 9 who had observed Sandoz 's collapse with the bland analytical interest of a civil engineer watching a bridge fail . “
50341	50347	50137	50137	You	261	” Danny said to Sandoz . “
50358	50378	50137	50137	You	261	” John was appalled but , to his astonishment , Emilio laughed and sat up , shaking his head . “
50389	50444	50445	50445	You	261	” Danny said quietly . It even sounded sincere , John noted . But Emilio nodded , apparently accepting the apology . Relieved that the whole awful business seemed to be resolving itself and determined to pull some good out of it , John went to the kitchen cupboards and threw open the doors . “
50457	50462	50454	50454	your	261	” John told him . “
50479	50496	50497	50497	I	0	” Sandoz pulled himself straight , drawing tattered dignity around his shoulders like an ermine cloak . "
50503	50504	50497	50497	I	0	" “
50508	50512	50526	50526	you	261	" Sean remarked , “
50528	50529	50526	50526	you	261	" "
50532	50536	50526	50526	you	261	” Danny said , “
50558	50559	50556	50556	ace	1870	” “
50569	50578	50556	50556	ace	1870	” Joseba said , arms over his chest . “
50597	50598	50599	50599	They	1903	” “
50608	50621	50622	50622	They	1903	" Sandoz said , as much to himself as to the others . “
50626	50632	50622	50622	They	1903	” Iron Horse confirmed softly . "
50643	50655	50637	50637	You	261	" Joseba took the glass from him and refilled it silently . “
50664	50678	50679	50679	Jesus	259	” Emilio wiped his face on his sleeves , still shaken but better . “
50686	50699	50700	50700	Sean	390	“ It 's only that y'had yersalf all nerved up about resigning , ”
50714	50738	50700	50700	Sean	390	“ And Danny Boy comes up with this crap about being sick . Y'got scared for the little girl , that 's all . ”
50751	50758	50759	50759	John	378	“ Big Chief Shit for Brains . ”
50786	50793	50794	50795	Iron Horse	385	" Candotti , you cook Italian ? ”
50811	50818	50803	50803	John	378	“ Yeah , I can cook . ”
50824	50878	50879	50879	Emilio	261	" Well , then ! Sandoz , if you can cook beans and rice , you can make spaghetti . You like macaroni and cheese ? That 'll put some weight on you . Macaroni and cheese was invented here in Naples . Pizza , too , eh ? Did you know that ? ”
50895	50948	50959	50959	he	385	" You have never eaten until you 've had real Neapolitan macaroni and cheese , right , Candotti ? Tell you what . You guys start the water boiling and I 'll go get some groceries from the refectory and we 'll teach Sandoz here how to cook himself some decent food . "
50973	50989	50959	50959	he	385	" SHATTERED LIKE A WHISKEY BOTTLE HITTING MAIN STREET IN FRONT of the Hotel Bell , ”
50997	51042	50990	50992	Daniel Iron Horse	385	“ I 'm telling you : he 'll be a liability out there . He will fall apart at the wrong time and somebody'll get killed ! Let 's just use him as a resource and then put the poor bastard out to pasture . "
51043	51092	51160	51160	he	262	" Danny , we 've been over this . We ca n't afford to waste him . What he knows cost us billions and three priests and four good laypeople , not to mention all the damage that was done to the Society because of the bad publicity . ”
51093	51117	51160	51160	he	262	“ Hell , we were already in deep shit when that hit the fan . Point is , what 'd it cost Sandoz ? "
51118	51121	51130	51130	he	262	“ Everything , ”
51163	51179	51160	51160	he	262	“ I do n't need you to remind me of that , Father Iron Horse . "
51197	51217	51218	51218	Giuliani	262	“ For what it 's worth , the Holy Father insists that Sandoz is meant to return to Rakhat , ”
51237	51275	51218	51218	Giuliani	262	“ His Holiness points out that six ships have attempted to reach Rakhat in the past forty years , and only the two directly concerned with Sandoz have made it . Gelasius III sees Providence in this . ”
51314	51322	51323	51323	Danny	385	“ So what does His Holiness propose ? "
51328	51380	51323	51323	Danny	385	“ We up on the dashboard of our spaceship like a plastic Jesus and use him to prop Sandoz CHILDREN OF GOD III ward off collisions with interstellar debris ? Bundle up his little bones with some bird feathers in a medicine pouch and hope the hull does n't crack apart ? "
51381	51386	51387	51387	Giuliani	262	“ Are you finished ! "
51404	51434	51435	51435	Danny	385	“ The Pope believes Sandoz must return to Rakhat to learn why he was sent there in the first place . He believes Emilio Sandoz is beloved of God . "
51441	51468	51435	51435	Danny	385	“ Like Saint Teresa said : If that 's how God treats His friends , it 's no wonder He 's got so few of them . ”
51515	51526	51527	51527	he	257	“ This is prime liquor . I admire your taste , ”
51537	51564	51527	51527	he	257	“ Sandoz is medically fragile , emotionally unstable and mentally unreliable . The mission does n't require him and I do n't want him on it . "
51565	51603	51604	51604	He	257	“ He is the toughest man I 've ever known , Danny . If you had seen what he was like a year ago , even a few months ago . If you knew what he 's — "
51613	51633	51604	51604	He	257	“ He will be on that ship , Father Iron Horse . Causa finita . The matter is closed . ”
51653	51661	51662	51662	Danny	385	“ Do you hate him that much ? ”
51673	51695	51666	51666	Giuliani	262	“ Or does he just scare you so bad , you do n't even want to share a planet with him ? "
51711	51719	51720	51721	Iron Horse	257	“ No . That 's not it . ”
51736	51814	51720	51721	Iron Horse	257	“ Taking Sandoz back to Rakhat is the price of getting the Suppression lifted , is n't it . All we have to do is humor the Pope ! Put one poor , old , broken - down ex - Jeb on the next ship out , and win , lose or draw — the prodigals shall be welcomed back to the bosom of Peter , with Vatican bells ringing and a glory of angels shouting hosannah . "
51822	51838	51839	51841	Danny Iron Horse	385	“ The Dominicans will be furious . It 's a beautiful deal , Father General , ”
51864	51878	51839	51841	Danny Iron Horse	385	“ Why , this time , you 'll be the one making history . ”
51927	51938	51888	51888	Giuliani	262	“ You are a first - class sonofabitch , Danny , ”
51957	51964	51951	51951	he	385	“ I 'm counting on that . ”
52026	52033	52034	52034	KINSA	438	" SUPAARI HAS BROUGHT SOMEONE HOME ! "
52144	52155	52156	52156	he	286	“ Sipaj , Kinsa : they were worried about you , "
52202	52207	52226	52226	he	286	“ Sipaj , Supaari , ”
52214	52221	52226	52226	he	286	“ you are not safe here . ”
52265	52270	52271	52271	he	286	“ Sipaj , people , ”
52275	52291	52271	52271	he	286	“ everything will be peaceful . There is nothing worth making such a fierno about . ”
52386	52391	52392	52395	one of the elders	1938	“ Sipaj , Supaari , ”
52399	52416	52392	52395	one of the elders	1938	“ the midwife Paquarin sent us word . She used your money to send a runner . ”
52417	52426	52427	52428	another woman	1940	“ So we knew why the hunter came , "
52443	52454	52427	52428	another woman	1940	“ Sipaj , Supaari . Paquarin is gone now too . "
52484	52490	52491	52491	someone	1080	" A hunter took her , ”
52494	52505	52491	52491	someone	1080	“ But her runner saw , and came to us . "
52513	52520	52491	52491	someone	1080	“ You are not safe here ! "
52521	52530	52531	52531	Supaari	286	“ Sipaj , people ! Someone must think ! ”
52559	52562	52563	52563	he	286	“ Kinsa , ”
52574	52592	52563	52563	he	286	“ take the baby outside and feed her , child . There 're provisions in the luggage . ”
52602	52614	52599	52599	he	286	" The hunter who came here — where is he now ? "
52627	52632	52634	52635	Djalao VaKashan	306	“ Someone killed him , "
52677	52686	52688	52688	Djalao	306	“ The djanada say there must be balance , ”
52715	52720	52721	52721	Djalao	306	“ Birth by birth , ”
52725	52741	52721	52721	Djalao	306	“ Life by life . Death by death . Someone made a balance for Paquarin . ”
52873	52878	52881	52881	someone	1080	“ Sipaj , Supaari , "
52914	52921	52881	52881	someone	1080	“ Can you not become hasta'akala ? "
52922	52927	52928	52928	Supaari	286	“ Sipaj , Manuzhai , ”
52932	52940	52928	52928	Supaari	286	“ Someone is sorry for your loss . "
52941	52969	52970	52971	No one	5227	” The VaKashani 's ears dropped listlessly . Supaari turned back to the others , as the impossible idea of making him hasta'akala rippled through the crowd . "
52979	52984	52970	52971	No one	5227	" he told them . "
53012	53013	52977	52977	hasta'akala	454	” “
53020	53114	53115	53115	Someone	1080	" somebody cried , and this idea was taken up with enthusiasm . They meant well . A man in trouble could barter his property and titles for immunity to prosecution if he could find someone to take him on as a dependent and keep him off the public stipend rolls . In return for lodging and provision , the hasta'akala yielded everything he possessed to the sponsor and had his hands clipped — a lifelong guarantee against his becoming a VaHaptaa poacher . Supaari stood so they could all see him clearly . “
53141	53201	53202	53202	Sipaj	311	” he said as gently as he could . They understood then . Runa had no access to state meat allowances , and obviously no right to hunt . There was a soft thudding of tails , raised and dropped to the ground in gestures of dismay and pity , as the talk fell off to an unhappy silence . “
53206	53211	53202	53202	Sipaj	311	” Manuzhai said then , "
53240	53247	53248	53248	Sipaj	311	” Other voices joined Manuzhai 's : “
53258	53259	53252	53252	we	1969	” “
53266	53267	53260	53261	The VaKashani	312	” “
53278	53279	53268	53269	This one	1436	" "
53285	53657	53658	53658	Sipaj	311	" To the end of his days , Supaari would remember the sensation of the ground moving under his feet , as though there had been a minor earthquake . For an instant , it felt so real that he looked around at the Runa in astonishment , and wondered why they did not flee to open ground , to escape the rockfall sure to follow . Why not ? he thought then . Runa had been bred since beyond remembering to serve Jana'ata in life and to sustain them in death . Manuzhai was clearly pining away from loneliness ; if the Runao did n't want to liveAgain , Supaari felt the sensation of movement . Even now , he would have 9 9 116 Mary Doria Russell eaten the supply of food he 'd brought with him from Kirabai without a thought ! But that was n't ... people like these . He had never taken meat from his own villages or household compound . Indeed , he had never killed his own prey . He was a city man ! He collected his meat already butchered , never thinking—. There was nothing wrong with it ; it was perfectly natural . Everything dies . It would be a waste if ... a People like these . Walking out to the edge of the meeting hall 's terrace , where the rockface dropped away steeply to the river below , Supaari stared into the distance and would have keened like a child if he had been alone . No , he thought , looking back at the VaKashani , seeing them all with new eyes . Better to starve . Thinking this , he realized at long last why Sandoz , whom Supaari knew to be carnivorous , had obstinately insisted on eating like a Runao while in Gayjur . Well , I can not eat like a Runao , he thought angrily . And I will not scavenge ! Which left one honorable course open to him and his child . The dream cave , he thought , and saw himself , lost , with his daughter in his arms . When he spoke , it was firmly . “
53671	53672	53771	53771	Supaari	286	" “
53676	53727	53771	53771	Supaari	286	” the cry went up . He shrugged : a movement of the shoulders that he had learned from Sandoz , a foreigner trapped in a situation he could not escape and hardly understood . The Runa were a practical folk , and so Supaari fell back upon plain facts . “
53761	53768	53769	53769	Sipaj	311	” It was Manuzhai who said , “
53798	53867	53787	53787	She	1436	” Again there was a burst of cheerful agreement , the VaKashani pressing forward to pat his back , pledging him their support , delighted by their solution to his troubles , happy to help this Jana'ata merchant who 'd always been kind and decent . It was nearly impossible to resist them , but then he met the eyes of Djalao , standing apart from the others . “
53876	53924	53787	53787	She	1436	” said Djalao , holding his gaze like a hunter , but it seemed that she was offering death to Supaari himself , not to Manuzhai . The others took up the notion happily ; no VaRakhati - neither Runa nor Jana'ata — had ever yet said , “
53929	54418	54419	54419	Sipaj	311	” a CHILDREN OF GOD 117 Supaari turned his head away , unable to bear Djalao 's stare . He agreed to consider their offer , and promised a decision in the morning . a RUNA BLADES WERE OF VOLCANIC GLASS , SHARPER THAN ANY STEEL , with a knapped edge so fine that Supaari would hardly feel its work . There would be a few quick , neat strokes through the fleshless webbing between his fingers , and the short , thick - muscled digits would fall free almost bloodlessly . In some ways , he had already adapted to the reduction in function , having severed his own claws days before . He expected that his hands would be clumsier than ever , but he had always had Runa to take care of his clothes , to write for him and open doors and groom his coat and prepare his food . To be his food . Physically , the hasta'akala was a trivial procedure , but the permanance of it ! The irrevocable change in status ! Always before , Supaari had met adversity with the conviction that he could turn it to advantage somehow , but if he accepted the hasta'akala , he conceded guilt . He was marked forever as a dependent -- of Runa ! And though he now admitted to himself that he had always been dependent on Runa — even so , it was bitter . Apart from Sandoz , Supaari had never known a hasta'akala . Once accepted by a sponsor , such men were of no further interest to the government and there was nothing to prevent them from traveling abroad except shame . Now Supaari understood why Jana'ata who submitted to the procedure most often withdrew from society , sequestering themselves like women , loath to be seen . He himself could hardly stand to be with the elated Runa villagers who continued to talk blithely through the evening of their plans to care for him , discussing the order in which Djalao could slaughter the elders ... Sometime that night , during the endless blind misery that sleep did not curtail , he realized that their scheme was well meant , but it could n't work . If the village corporation fed Supaari and Haʼanala , it would n't make its quota to the state . It was unprecedented , that a Runa corporation would take on the sponsorship of a hasta'akala . A Runao culling another Runao — it might be illegal . There was no telling what a court would make of it . The arrangement probably would n't hold up under legal scrutiny and , even if it did , Hlavin Kitheri could annul the hasta'akala contract by decree . By first sunrise , he had resolved to walk into the wilderness and die a 118 Mary Doria Russell there with his child . “
54423	54437	54421	54421	people	950	” he called out , when the Runa roused and his vision sharpened . “
54475	54538	54462	54462	Someone	1080	” They would not simply let him go ; they were Runa , and nothing could be done without consensus . The discussion seemed to him interminable and he was frantic to leave , truly frightened now by what could happen if he were discovered here . In the end , it was Djalao who dropped a tail and said without emotion , "

54573	54635	54563	54563	he	1436	” Gina Giuliani said very clearly , beginning to lose patience on the fourth time through this particular line of interrogation . It was hard enough to manage her own disappointment without dealing with Celestina 's over and over . The story of my life these days , Gina thought , and tried not to sigh as she drained the pasta .

Even when they were CHILDREN OF GOD 123 first married , Domenico was screwing around so much , he could n't imagine that his own wife was n't . Never believed Carlo was his . Poisoned everything .

56909	57147	56844	56844	her	275	" Nor were any likely to be offered , she realized as the weeks became months . Every Friday , she left guinea - pig chow and a bag of fresh litter at the refectory with Cosimo . After the first two visits , she made a point of doing this while Celestina was at kindergarten . It was bad enough trying to explain Carlo 's absences and inconsistencies to the child without attempting to explain Emilio Sandoz as well . Once , in early spring , she worked herself into a rage and considered banging on Sandoz 's door to tell him he could ignore her but not Celestina , but she identified this almost a 124 Mary Doria Russell a a immediately as displaced emotion , more properly aimed at Carlo Giuliani than at an ex - priest she barely knew . She understood that a good portion of what she felt and thought about Emilio Sandoz was concocted of equal parts romantic idiocy , hurt pride and sexual fantasy . Gina , she would tell herself , Carlo is a prick but you are a fool . On the other hand , she thought prosaically , fantasies about a dark , brooding man with a tragic past are more interesting than blubbering over getting dumped by a jerk for a teenaged boy . And Emilio had sent her flowers . Flowers and four words : "
57153	57260	57261	57261	SIGNORA	419	” That implied something , did n't it ? It was n't all in her head . She had the note . She might have wished for some golden mean between Carlo 's endlessly inventive eloquence and the strict , unexpansive silence of Emilio Sandoz . But in the end , she decided to play by Emilio 's rules , even if she did n't know quite what they were . There did n't seem to be any other choice , apart from forgetting him altogether . And that , Gina found , was evidently not an option . a а WHAT COULD HE HAVE SAID ? “
57291	57990	57991	57991	You	2034	” There was no point in scaring her — he was frightened enough for both of them . So Emilio Sandoz took himself hostage until he could prove to his own satisfaction that he was not a danger to others . It was an act of will , and it required of him a complete strategic reversal in his war with the past . Living alone had allowed him to withdraw with honor from the battlefield his body represented . Once a source of satisfaction , it had become an unwanted burden , to be punished for its frailties and vulnerability with indifference and contempt . He fueled it when hunger interfered with his work , rested it when he was tired enough to sleep through nightmares , despised it when it failed him : when the headaches almost blinded him , when his hands hurt so much that he sat laughing in the dark , the pain comic in its intensity . He had never before felt so entirely disconnected from himself . He was not a virgin . Neither was he an ascetic ; while studying for the priesthood , he had come to the conclusion that he would not be able to live as a celibate by denying or ignoring his physical needs . This is my body , he told his silent God , this is what I am . He provided himself with CHILDREN OF GOD 125 sexual release and knew this was as necessary to him as food and rest , as lacking in sin as the desire to run , to field a baseball , to dance . And yet , he was aware that he had taken inordinate pride in his ability to govern himself and that this , in part , accounted for his reaction to the rapes . When he began to understand that resistance made it worse for him and more gratifying for those who used him , he tried to submit passively , to deny them as much as he could . It was beyond him : intolerable , impossible . And when he could not endure being used again , when he decided to kill or die rather than submit once more , it had cost Askama 's life . Was rape his punishment for pride ? An ugly lesson in humility , but one he might have been able to learn , had Askama not died for his sins . None of it made sense . Why had God not left him in Puerto Rico ? He had never sought or expected spiritual grandeur . For years he was , without complaint , solo cum Solus - alone with the Alone , hearing nothing of God , feeling nothing of God , expecting nothing of God . He lived in the world without being part of it , lived in the unfathomable without being part of it . He was grateful to be what he had become : an ex - academic , a parish priest working in the slum of his childhood . But then , on Rakhat , when Emilio Sandoz had made a place in his soul large enough and open enough , he had , against all expectation , been filled with God - not filled but inundated ! He felt himself flooded , drowned in light , deafened by the power of it . He had not sought this ! He had never taken pride in it , never understood it as recompense for what he had offered God . What filled him was incommensurate , measureless , unearned , unimagined . It was God 's grace , freely given . Or so he 'd thought . Was it arrogance and not faith , to have believed that the mission to Rakhat was part of some plan ? Until the very moment that the Jana'ata patrol began to slaughter children , there was no warning , no hint that they were making a fatal mistake . Why had God abandoned them all , human and Runa alike ? Why this silent , brutal indifference after so much apparent intervention ? "
58002	58015	57998	57998	I	0	” he read in Jeremiah , weeping , when Kalingemala Lopore left . “
58029	58391	58021	58021	I	0	" Outraged that anyone 's faith should be tested as his had been , and profoundly ashamed that he had failed that test , Emilio Sandoz knew only that he could not accept the unacceptable and thank God for it . So he had abandoned his body , abandoned his soul — surrendered them uncondi- 2 126 Mary Doria Russell a tionally to whatever force had beaten him , tried to live only in a mind over which he retained sovereignty . And for a time , he found not peace but at least a kind of uneasy ceasefire . Daniel Iron Horse put an end to that ; whatever had happened on Rakhat , whoever was to blame , Emilio Sandoz was alive and his life touched other lives . So , he told himself , face it . He ate decent meals three times a day , as though the food were medicine . He began again to run , circling the dormant retreat house gardens , working up to four eight - minute miles every morning , rain or shine . Twice a day , he forced himself to break off work and carefully picked up a set of handweights , methodically exercising arm muscles that now did double duty , indirectly controlling his fingers through the brace mechanisms . By April , he was approaching welterweight , and the shirts he wore no longer looked as though they were still on hangers . The headaches persisted . The nightmares continued . But he won back lost ground with infantry doggedness and , this time , he was determined to hold it . IT WAS AN UNUSUALLY CHILLY MORNING IN EARLY MAY AND CELESTINA was at kindergarten when Gina Giuliani glanced out the kitchen window and noticed a man on foot talking to the guard at the end of the drive . She recognized the gray suede jacket she 'd bought for him before she recog . nized Sandoz himself and briefly considered doing something about her hair , but changed her mind . Pulling on a cardigan , she walked out the back door to meet him . “

The body , the mind , the soul — these are all one thing to me . ”
59289	59322	59323	59323	He	2048	“ I now believe that I chose celibacy as a path to God because it was a discipline in which the body and the mind and the soul were all one thing . "
59333	59349	59323	59323	He	2048	“ When—. You must understand that there was not one rape but many , yes ? "
59360	59446	59350	59350	He	2048	“ There were seventeen men , and the assaults went on for months . During that time , and afterward , I tried to separate what happened to me physically from what it ... did to me . I tried to believe , It is only my body . This can not touch what I am . It was ... not possible for me to think in this way . Forgive me , signora . I have no right to ask you to hear this . "
59454	59459	59460	59460	she	2049	“ I 'm listening , ”
59475	59535	59463	59463	Coward	471	“ Signora , I wish there to be no misunderstanding between us . Whatever the legalities , I am not a priest . My vows are a nullity . If we had met at another time , I would wish for us perhaps more than friendship . But what I once gave to God freely is now enforced by — ”
59561	59565	59566	59566	he	2048	“ By aversion , ”
59570	59596	59566	59566	he	2048	“ I am not whole . Can it be acceptable to you that what I offer in return for your friendship will be something less ? "
59664	59673	59674	59674	she	2049	“ Don Emilio , you offer me honesty , ”
59681	59693	59674	59674	she	2049	“ This , I think , is not less than friendship . ”
59749	59752	59753	59753	she	2049	“ Well , ”
59764	59772	59753	59753	she	2049	“ you can still have the coffee . ”
59820	59830	59831	59831	he	2048	“ I think I 'd rather have a beer , ”
59837	59845	59831	59831	he	2048	“ but it 's only ten o'clock . ”
59846	59852	59853	59853	she	2049	“ Travel is so broadening , ”
59857	59866	59867	59867	He	2048	“ Have you ever had a Croatian breakfast ? "
59872	59879	59880	59880	she	2049	“ A shot of plum brandy , ”
59883	59888	59880	59880	she	2049	“ followed by espresso . ”
59889	59892	59893	59893	he	2048	“ That , ”
59900	59905	59893	59893	he	2048	“ would do nicely . ”
60061	60066	60067	60067	he	2048	" I missed you , ”
60079	60082	60083	60083	she	2049	“ Good , ”
60105	60110	60111	60111	she	2049	“ How 's Elizabeth ? "
60117	60133	60134	60134	Emilio	418	“ Fine ! She 's a good pet . I really enjoy having her around , ”
60147	60169	60170	60170	He	2048	“ John Candotti made her an amazing cage -- three compartments and a tunnel . Pig Land , we call it . ”
60193	60212	60213	60213	he	2048	“ Would you and Celestina like to come for lunch some time ? I have learned to cook , ”
60224	60233	60234	60234	She	275	“ Real food . Not just packaged stuff . ”
60240	60260	60234	60234	She	275	“ We 'd love to , but I 'm afraid Celestina eats very little aside from macaroni and cheese . ”
60261	60264	60265	60265	he	2048	" Kismet ! ”
60278	60291	60265	60265	he	2048	" Macaroni and cheese , signora , happens to be my speciality . ”
60804	60810	60811	60811	Emilio	418	" We can do it , "
60814	60865	60811	60811	Emilio	418	“ This time for sure ! Even if it takes us all day , it 's okay because this is the longest day of the All morning , they commiserated over how easy this was for other ple , but conquered frustration together , and ultimately shared a radiant year . ”
61474	61485	61486	61486	She	275	“ I do n't think I did that quite right . ”
61498	61503	61486	61486	She	275	“ It takes practice . ”
61537	61551	61552	61552	She	275	“ Practice ! You mean we get to do that more than once ? "
61561	61566	61567	61567	she	275	“ Get off me , ”
61583	61590	61567	61567	she	275	" I do n't think so . "
61591	61601	61602	61602	she	275	“ Get off me ! You weigh a ton , ”
61612	61619	61602	61602	she	275	“ All that macaroni and cheese ! "
61620	61628	61629	61629	he	418	“ No . I like it here , ”
61659	61662	61651	61651	she	275	“ Celestina ! ”
61663	61667	61668	61668	he	418	“ Soy cosquilloso ! ”
61673	61699	61668	61668	he	418	“ I do n't know what that is in Italian . What do you call it when there 's a reaction to touch like that ? "
61700	61703	61704	61704	she	275	“ Ticklish , ”
61723	61728	61729	61729	He	418	“ You sound surprised . ”
61739	61758	61729	61729	He	418	“ I did n't know . How would I find that out ? People do n't tickle Jesuits ! ”
61770	61779	61780	61780	he	418	“ Well , some people tickle some Jesuits , ”
61784	61798	61780	61780	he	418	“ but I assure you , madam , that no one tickled me . ”
61799	61812	61838	61838	he	418	“ Not even your parents ? You were n't always a priest . ”
61813	61816	61817	61817	he	418	" No , "
61852	61859	61860	61860	he	418	“ I hate macaroni and cheese , ”
61863	61887	61860	61860	he	418	“ There were no dragons to slay for my beloved , but I ate macaroni and cheese for you . I want credit . ”
61897	61900	61901	61901	she	275	“ Wait , ”
61910	61919	61901	61901	she	275	“ Go back to that part about beloved . "
61920	62139	61904	61904	he	418	” But his lips dropped once more onto her mouth , and this time he did better . They were discreet , for Celestina 's sake , and he was gone before dawn . It was as difficult as anything he 'd ever done , to say good - bye to her and leave . But there were other days at the beach that wore Celestina out early , and other nights that wore them both out late , and as that summer passed , she made him whole again . There was no memory of bestiality that CHILDREN OF GOD 133 she did not efface with beauty and gentleness , no humiliation that was not eclipsed by her warmth . And sometimes , when the dreams came , she was with him : salvation in the night . Before the summer was over , while the days were still far too long and the nights all too short , when the fragrance of lemon trees and oranges had deepened and drifted each night through her bedroom window to scent the sheets and her hair , he began to give back to her some of what she had given him . He had a sense , sometimes , of flawless peace . The words of Donne seemed perfect : “
62154	63041	63042	63042	Sipaj	311	” Attacked by hope , he could no longer resist belief in the goodness of having a future , and felt the past 's grip loosen . It 's over , he would think now and then . It 's finally over . 14 Trucha Sai 2042 - 2046 , Earth - Relative - SOFIA MENDES DID NOT LACK COMPANIONSHIP IN TRUCHA SAI . THE VILa lage population stabilized at about 350 , and there were other settlements nearby ; visits were common and festive . She shared chores and meals with many people , and soon it felt natural to pass the time weaving the swordlike leaves of diuso trees into mats , windbreaks , umbrellas , cooking packets for steaming roots , baskets for collecting fruit . She participated in the seasonal round of ripening , and learned the location and identification of useful plants , the ways to avoid dangers , and how to find one 's way in what had first appeared impenetrable jungle . She was becoming a competent Runa adult - a knowledgeable field botanist , a useful member of the community — and found a certain satisfaction in that . But during the early months of her exile , the orbiting Stella Maris library system was the nearest thing she had to an intellectual companion . She could not reach the ship physically , but she spent much of her day in radio contact with the library . After she had polished and edited them , she poured her observations of Runa life and her private thoughts into its memory , rather than leave them logged only on her own computer tablet . This habit made her feel less isolated , as though she were sending messages , not making entries in a diary . Someday her words would reach Earth , and she could believe herself a solitary scientist , contributing to her own society with her research . Still human . Still sane . CHILDREN OF GOD 135 a Then , when Isaac was only fifteen months old , the morning came when she called up the access routines and was greeted by an unyielding silence . Staring at the laconic error message on her screen , she felt the physical jolt of a ship whose mooring rope has suddenly given way . Had the onboard systems become corrupted somehow ? Perhaps the ship 's orbit had degraded and the Stella Maris itself had burned up in the atmosphere or fallen into the Rakhati sea . There were endless possibilities . The only thing she did not consider was what had actually occurred : a second party from Earth , traveling under the auspices of the United Nations , had in fact arrived on Rakhat . Some twelve weeks after landfall , the Contact Consortium had located Emilio Sandoz . Believing him the sole survivor of the Jesuit mission , they had sent the Stella Maris on its automated way back to Earth , navigated by Sofia 's own artificial - intelligence programs , carrying Emilio Sandoz home alone to infamy . There were many kinds of loneliness , she discovered . There was the loneliness that came from understanding but not being understood . There was the loneliness of having no one to banter or argue with , no one to be challenged by . Loneliness at night was different from the daylight loneliness that sometimes overwhelmed her in the midst of a crowd . She became a connoisseur of loneliness , and the worst kind of all , she discovered , came after a night when she dreamed of Isaac laughing . A tiny infant , long and fatless , he had slept away his early weeks with a heavy unresponsiveness that frightened her . She recognized that sleep was his way of concentrating his meager resources on survival , so she fought the desire to rouse him , knowing it to be a sign of her own need for reassurance . But even when he was awake , he could not meet her eye for than a moment or two without going gray under his papery skin , and though he suckled more strongly as the weeks passed , he often vomited her milk . No matter what she told herself about a preemie 's undeveloped digestive system , it was difficult not to feel this as a heartbreaking rejection . At six months , Isaac remained birdlike and remote , always looking into the distance , intent on some far - off mystery of leaves and light and shadow . By his first birthday , he had an otherworldly dignity , a tiny quiet unsmiling boy with deep - set elvish eyes , who spent a great deal of his time examining the kaleidoscope of his own fingers , entranced by the patterns they made . She began to hope that his silence had its roots in deafness , for he did not babble , did not turn toward her when she called his name , seemed not to hear the Runa children around him as they squabbled and a a more a a 136 Mary Doria Russell played and teased and huffed in breathy laughter . But one day , he said , “
63044	63053	63042	63042	Sipaj	311	" and repeated it endlessly until the word for “
63057	63742	63055	63055	me	0	" became as meaningless as a mantra for all who listened . Then the silence closed in again . As his second birthday approached , he seemed to have achieved a state of unassailable self - containment : a precocious Zen master without needs , a without desires . He would nurse when Sofia placed her nipple in his mouth ; later , he would eat when food was placed on his tongue , drink if water were brought to his lips . He would allow himself to be picked up and held , but he never raised his arms to anyone . Carried about by his Runa playmates as though he were a doll , he would wait unmoving and unmoved for the interruption of his reverie to cease ; put down , he would return to his meditation as though the incident had not occurred . Inside his invisible citadel , it seemed , there was a perfection from which the outside world could not distract or tempt him . He sat for hours , still and well balanced as a Yogi , his face sometimes transformed by a smile of shattering beauty , as though privately pleased by some secret , sacred thought . Sofia did not have to ask what would have been done with a Runa baby so abnormal . Like a Spartan exposing his deformed infant on a wolfprowled hillside , a Runa father would have given a defective child up to the djanada — veal for Jana'ata aristocrats . Perhaps the Runa did not realize there was anything wrong with Isaac , or perhaps they did n't care ; Isaac was not Runa and so the rules for him were different . As far as Sofia could tell , they simply accepted Isaac 's solitary silence as they accepted his lack of tail and his hairless body , as they accepted nearly everything in their world : with placid good humor and unruffled calm . So Sofia , too , tried to accept her son as he was , but it was not easy to watch her child stare for hours at his hands or sit patting the ground with a quiet unchanging tattoo as he listened to some inner melody . As beautiful and inhuman as an angel , Isaac would have been difficult for any mother to love , and Sofia Mendes 's life had provided little opportunity to practice loving In the most hidden region of her soul , she felt an unspeakable relief that her son desired so little of her . For years , the only measure she had of how deeply she felt the loss of her parents was the unreasoning terror that swept through her at the mere thought of dying young and orphaning a child of her own . There were some compensations for Isaac 's condition , she told herself . If she died , he 'd hardly notice . CHILDREN OF GOD 137 She would realize later how close she 'd come to madness . She 'd looked over the edge of it , dizzy and careless at the brink , by the time Isaac was four years old . It was then that Supaari and his infant daughter arrived in Trucha Sai , brought there by Djalao and several other VaKashani women . The forest Runa showed no amazement at his unexpected appearance in a haven they had always kept a secret from their Jana'ata masters ; it was their nature to accept things without much questioning , and Supaari VaGayjur had always been different from other djanada . But if the Runa were as calm as ever , Sofia Mendes was rocked by the strength of her emotions . Supaari was Jana'ata and yet , when she first saw him , she did not think of riot or death , of oppression or exploitation or cruelty , but only of friendship and an end to loneliness . It was the first time since Isaac 's birth that she had found something to thank God for . "
63750	63815	63743	63743	THEY	2090	” SUPAARI SAID IN H'INGLISH , STARING at the tiny foreigner . Horrified , he spun away and walked a few paces and then returned to her , like a scavenger returning to a carcass . He reached down toward Sofia 's face , disfigured by the tripled scar , and felt even more ashamed when she seemed to flinch away from his touch . “
63823	63831	63816	63816	I	0	” he said , pleading for understanding . “
63840	63958	63959	63959	Sipaj	311	” Because he expected it , he saw hatred and blame in her face . Exhausted from his journey and all that had gone before it , staggered by the sheer majestic variety of ways he had managed to be wrong about things , the Jana'ata sank by degrees , weight shifting from feet to tail to knees to haunches until at last he slumped on the ground , head down between hands sunken into the forest humus . Her wordless reproach — her very existence — seemed to him a killing blow and he was fervently wishing for some quick death when he felt her small hands on each side of his head , lifting it . “
63963	63977	63959	63959	Sipaj	311	” she said , kneeling so that she could look into his eyes , “
63989	64007	63978	63978	someone	1080	" Bleakly he thought , She did n't understand me . She has forgotten her own language . “
64014	64018	64008	64008	Someone	1080	” he whispered . “
64027	64109	64110	64110	Sipaj	311	" He rolled heavily into a sitting position , knees akimbo , and looked around : sleeping shelters , with their graceful sloping thatched roofs , creaking and flexing in the breeze ; woven windbreaks decorated with flow- 138 Mary Doria Russell a ers and ribbons ; raised sitting platforms paved with beautifully made cushions . Runa , going about their lives , untouched by Jana'ata law or custom . Apart from the awful disfigurement , the little foreigner appeared well . “
64114	64119	64110	64110	Sipaj	311	” he said finally , “
64141	64205	64206	64206	I	0	” She said nothing and he tried to read the expression on her face , to make sense of her scent , her posture . It was unnerving , this inability to be sure of what anything meant , knowing now how little he had understood Sandoz , wondering if he had even been wrong to believe that Ha’an had cared for him . “
64209	64232	64206	64206	I	0	” he said slowly in K’San , for Ruanja did not have what he needed and he believed Sofia had forgotten H'inglish , “
64258	64259	64249	64249	you	2095	” “
64262	64284	64285	64285	Someone	1080	” She joined him on the ground , sitting cross - legged on the low grassy herbage that covered the clearing . “
64297	64325	64291	64291	Someone	1080	” She could see how tired he was and the long , handsome face seemed thin to her , its elegant bones more prominent than she remembered . “
64338	64361	64371	64371	He	0	” she began , the Ruanja formula as natural to her now as if she had lived with it all her life . “
64385	64388	64389	64389	he	0	“ Please , ”
64402	64403	64389	64389	he	0	" “
64410	64421	64389	64389	he	0	” He threw his head up and away from her . “
64427	64435	64389	64389	he	0	” he asked the sky in K'San . “
64441	64486	64489	64489	you	0	" From out of the crowd surrounding Supaari 's VaKashani escort , Djalao came forward , having heard his cry . She was carrying the sturdy basket she had packed with provisions for him and his child and dumped it abruptly on the ground . “
64493	64731	64734	64734	Fia	305	” she said quietly , but with a hardness that Sofia had never before heard in a Runao 's voice . Some kind of unspoken understanding passed between Djalao and Supaari then , but it was beyond Sofia 's ability to read from their body language . The children — scampering and chasing one another , excited by the visitors and the break in routine — became louder and more unruly by the minute , and before Sofia could call out a warning , Kanchay 's daughter Puska took advantage of her father 's absorption in adult talk to leap onto his back , instantly pushing off it with an arching joy - jump that tipped Supaari 's basket over . Unruffled , Kanchay separated himself from the adults ' conversation , repacking the basket 's contents quickly before the children CHILDREN OF GOD 139 could catch the scent , and then tore off , bent over and arms flung wide , gently barreling into the little mob of youngsters , sweeping them into a delighted , squirming heap . Smiling , Sofia looked around for Isaac , concerned that he had wandered off while everyone was preoccupied . But there he was : lying on his back , watching winged seeds spiral down toward his face from the w'ralia above him . Sofia sighed and returned her gaze to Supaari , sitting dazed on the ground . “
64740	64756	64757	64757	Someone	1080	” he said . He glanced up at Djalao VaKashan , and his ears flattened . “
64762	64766	64767	64767	Someone	1080	" he cried . "
64778	64779	64780	64780	Sipaj	311	” “
64784	64792	64782	64782	Supaari	286	” Djalao said , standing above him . “
64801	64860	64861	64861	Sipaj	311	” Not what — who is in the basket ? Sofia thought , realizing now that Kanchay had repacked it quickly to protect the children from an early understanding . Chilled , staring at Supaari , she thought , He eats Runa . He is djanada . It was a long time before any of them could speak . “
64871	64921	64863	64863	Supaari	286	" Sofia said at last with the simple Runa logic that was , for the time being , all she could muster . Standing , she grasped the Jana'ata 's arm in a token effort to lift him to his feet . He looked up at her , distracted . “
64930	64941	64942	64942	Weand	2100	” she said , tugging on his arm a little . “
64953	65116	64944	64944	you	286	” SUPAARI GOT UP AND TRIED TO CARRY THE BASKET AWAY FROM THE clearing so he could eat downwind and beyond the lines of Runa sight . He must always have known what he was doing at some level ; even before , it had seemed unconscionable to eat meat in the presence of Runa . Snarling softly , he struggled with the basket — the handles of which were , after all , suitable only for a Runao to carry — and felt even worse when Kanchay climbed out of the tangle of children to help him . The girl Kinsa , neither adult nor child herself , had sat murmuring to Ha'anala all this time , not quite sure where she belonged . Seeing Supaari move off , she decided to follow along , carrying the baby on her back . Sofia , walking beside her , reached out and put a finger under the infant 's tiny curved claws . “
65119	65123	65124	65124	Yours	286	" she cried . “
65132	65137	65129	65129	Someone	1080	" 140 Mary Doria Russell "
65144	65164	65166	65166	someone	1080	" he said , as Sofia took Ha'anala in her arms and Kanchay calmly unpacked a portion of meat . “
65174	65186	65166	65166	someone	1080	" He paused , looking again at her terrible scarred face . "
65196	65218	65166	65166	someone	1080	" Sofia looked up from the baby cradled in her lap and lifted her chin in affirmation . He went on , “
65287	65361	65284	65284	they	312	” She had been thinking what a joy it was to have an infant meet her eye , but hearing this . ... Of course , she thought . Meat is meat . But even after what happened to Anne and D.W. , it had never occurred to her that the others had been—. Oh , Jimmy ! she thought , throat closing spasmodically . Mouth dry , Supaari put his meal aside . “
65412	65444	65404	65404	She	2109	” He stopped when Sofia changed color abruptly . He could see the pulse racing at her throat , understood now the full tragedy of what he had to tell her . “
65450	65451	65445	65445	You	2111	" "
65457	65461	65462	65463	My God	1886	" she asked . “
65476	65477	65478	65478	He	2113	" “
65482	65486	65478	65478	He	2113	" Supaari cried . “
65547	65548	65549	65549	Marc	294	" "
65551	65555	65549	65549	Marc	294	" Sofia cried . "
65562	65563	65556	65556	Marc	294	" "
65570	65577	65566	65566	He	294	" Supaari doubled over in frustration . "
65588	65604	65578	65578	Sandoz	261	” Tired as he was , he got to his feet and began to pace . “
65617	65628	65612	65612	you	2111	” he demanded , swinging around to look at her . “
65631	65685	65612	65612	you	2111	” she said . Supaari 's baby began to keen . Kinsa , too , was becoming upset by the intensity of the emotion and seemed about to cry herself . Handing the infant to Kanchay , Sofia stood as well and stopped Supaari 's agitated prowling with a hand on his arm . “
65692	65702	65688	65688	I	0	” she a CHILDREN OF GOD 141 said again . “
65726	65727	65728	65728	Marc	294	” “
65742	65764	65765	65766	The hasta'akala	454	” Inexplicably , he held up his hands , but she was too distracted to see any point in the gesture . “
65773	65774	65765	65766	The hasta'akala	454	” "
65786	65787	65788	65789	The others	1111	" "

65799	65806	65797	65797	others	833	" she cried , frantic now . “

65861	65880	65881	65881	I	0	" She was swaying and he caught her before she fell , pressing his hands against her shoulders . “
65886	65974	65881	65881	I	0	” she told him , but he could see that she was n't . She sat on the ground and put her head in her hands . Kanchay gave the wailing baby to Kinsa and told the girl to go back to the clearing and stay with the others . He came and sat behind Sofia , arms around her shoulders protectively , and she leaned back to let him know she appreciated his gesture , but spoke again to Supaari , as calmly as she could . “
65978	65982	65881	65881	I	0	” she said . “
65987	66052	65881	65881	I	0	” > IT TOOK A LONG TIME , AND THREE LANGUAGES . HE TOLD HER HOW HE had tracked down Sandoz and found that Marc was alive as well but only just ; told about bribing the patrol commander , and about the hasta'akala and how he 'd meant only to protect Marc and Sandoz from being tried for inciting the Runa to riot . “
66056	66076	66053	66053	You	0	” he asked her , showing his hands again to display the thin , tough webbing between his fingers . “
66108	66142	66105	66105	Marc	294	” And then there was the season in Gayjur with Sandoz , and Supaari 's own fear that Emilio would perish of loneliness . That much , God help her , Sofia understood . “
66147	66152	66144	66144	others	833	” she reminded Supaari . “
66160	66178	66179	66179	Supaari	286	" When he did n't answer , she leaned forward to clutch at his arm and cried , “

66219	66227	66214	66214	I	0	” He turned away , ears down . "
66243	66249	66234	66235	The others	1111	” He stopped speaking abruptly . “
66258	66263	66256	66256	they	5747	” she said dully . “
66276	66277	66278	66278	I	0	" “
66283	66306	66307	66307	I	0	” he insisted , but she could sense that he was concealing something . Finally , he spoke again , very quietly . “
66324	66331	66332	66332	Sofia	356	" There was a long silence . “
66343	66371	66332	66332	Sofia	356	" She looked up , amazed that he should ask this now . But it was n't like him to evade . ... How could she explain ? “
66378	66394	66332	66332	Sofia	356	” Supaari looked blank ; English was no good . She tried again in Ruanja . “
66405	66411	66471	66471	you	356	” He lifted his chin . “
66430	66450	66424	66424	you	356	” Again , the chin went up but slower this time , and he was staring at her intently . “
66474	66475	66471	66471	you	356	" "
66476	66487	66471	66471	you	356	“ Even if they are first- or second - born ? ”
66488	66497	66471	66471	you	356	" Birth rank makes no difference among us — ”
66498	66511	66471	66471	you	356	“ A celibate is VaHaptaa , then . A criminal without rights ? "
66512	66515	66516	66516	she	356	“ No ! ”
66521	66535	66516	66516	she	356	“ Sipaj , Supaari , even this one finds celibacy hard to understand . ”
66556	66594	66536	66536	She	356	“ Men such as Sandoz and Marc and Dee set themselves apart . They choose not to behave this action for children or for pleasure . They are celibates so that they may serve God more completely . ”
66595	66602	66603	66603	She	356	" Who are ' god ' ? "
66609	66623	66624	66624	She	356	" Who is , not who are . There is only one God . ”
66645	66665	66640	66640	Supaari	286	" Sandoz said he was celibate — he said he took no wife so that he could serve many ! "
66693	66723	66680	66680	He	2144	“ He said he was celibate . Celibates serve god . God must be Q.E.D. , she thought , sighing . Where were the Jesuits when you needed them ? “
66747	66760	66761	66761	Sipaj	311	” Supaari sat down abruptly and rubbed the sides of his head . "
66765	66772	66773	66773	CHILDREN	1029	” she said sympathetically , many . "
66789	66797	66773	66775	CHILDREN OF GOD	813	“ Does your head hurt , too ? "
66798	66806	66807	66807	He	286	“ Yes . You make no sense ! ”
66825	66838	66807	66807	He	286	“ Maybe you make sense to you . I do n't understand . ”
66843	66853	66839	66839	Sofia	356	“ Anne said that 's the beginning of wisdom . "
66862	66868	66869	66869	she	356	" Wisdom : true knowing , ”
66872	66898	66869	66869	she	356	“ Anne said wisdom begins when you discover the difference between ' That does n't make sense ' and ' I do n't understand . ' ”
66899	66913	66914	66914	His	286	“ Then I must be very wisdom . I do n't understand anything . "
66948	66971	66923	66923	he	286	“ Sipaj , Fia . What means in H'inglish ‘ serve ? Can service mean the behavior for — for having pleasure ? "
66972	66976	66977	66977	she	356	“ It can , ”
66983	67041	66977	66977	she	356	“ But not for Marc and Dee and Meelo . For them , to serve meant to give help freely to others . To give food to the hungry , to make lodgings for .... Wait - serves many ? Oh , my God . . You created a market ? Supaari , what happened to Emilio ! "
67090	67128	67129	67129	he	286	“ I was proud of my cleverness ! I made myself stupid with my wish for children , but I thought , This Supaari , he is a fine , clever man . I should have understood ! ”
67136	67173	67129	67129	he	286	“ These were Jana'ata . My own people . I made great harm to Sandoz . Perhaps now the other foreigners also have been harmed the same way . And now , you shall hate me . ”

67619	67667	67668	67668	D.W.	302	“ Most people , now , they do n't like to go straight to the top , not really . They need to sidle up to a proposition , come at the thing a little off - center . They feel better with a chain of command , ”
67696	67757	67758	67758	He	302	“ Got a problem , you ask the sergeant . Sergeant might go to a captain he knows . Most folks would have a hell of a time getting up the nerve to bang on the general 's office door , even if he was the nicest fella in the world . Catholicism makes allowances for that in human beings . "
67779	67815	67758	67758	He	302	“ But the children of Abraham ? They look God straight in the face . Praise . Argue ! Dicker , complain . Takes a lot of guts to deal with the Almighty like that . ”
67878	67884	67885	67885	D.W.	302	“ Now why is that ? "
67959	67969	67970	67970	Yarbrough	300	“ Talk is cheap . We believe in action , ”
67973	68003	67970	67970	Yarbrough	300	“ Fight for justice . Feed the hungry . Take the beach . We none of us sit around hopin ' for some big damn miracle to fix things . ”
68052	68061	68062	68062	he	302	“ We do n't preach . We listen , ”
68065	68098	68062	68062	he	302	“ These 're God 's children , too , and this time we 're gon na learn what they got to teach us ' fore we go around returnin ' the favor . ”
68157	68164	68165	68165	Supaari	286	" Who are ‘ god ’ ? ”
68205	68222	68223	68223	he	302	“ Maybe God is only the most powerful poetic idea we humans're capable of thinkin ' , ”
68233	68258	68259	68259	he	302	“ Maybe God has no reality outside our minds and exists only in the paradox of Perfect Compassion and Perfect Justice . Or maybe , ”
68277	68328	68259	68259	he	302	“ maybe God is exactly as advertised in the Torah . Maybe , along with all its other truths and beauties , Judaism preserves for each generation of us the reality of the God of Abraham , of Isaac , of Jacob , of Moses — the God of Jesus . ”
68339	68370	68374	68374	his	302	“ A God with quirky , unfathomable rules , a God who gets fed up with us and pissed off ! But quick to forgive , Sofia , and generous , ”
68383	68428	68374	68374	his	302	“ always , always in love with humanity . Always there , waiting for us - generation after generation to return His passion . Ah , Sofia , darlin ' ! On my best days , I believe in Him with all my heart . ”
68429	68436	68437	68437	she	2203	“ And on your worst days ? "
68449	68471	68472	68472	he	302	“ Even if it 's only poetry , it 's poetry to live by , Sofia - poetry to die for , "
68490	68523	68524	68524	he	302	“ Maybe poetry is the only way we can get near the truth of God . ... And when the metaphors fail , we think it 's God who 's failed us ! ”
68530	68544	68524	68524	he	302	“ Now there 's an idea that buys some useful theological wiggle room ! ”
68611	68625	68602	68602	Hillel	487	“ That which is hateful to you , do not do unto others . ”
68763	68775	68776	68777	Marc Robichaux	294	“ God who has begun this will bring it to perfection , ”
68787	68802	68781	68782	Emilio Sandoz	261	“ We are here because God has brought us here , step by step . ”
68965	68969	68957	68957	Supaari	286	“ The others — ”
68990	69000	69001	69001	Kanchay	307	“ Sipaj , Fia ! What are you doing ? ”
69025	69031	69009	69009	she	2203	" What do you seek ? "

69065	69073	69079	69079	she	2203	“ Agh , Fia ! Stop that ! ”
69140	69150	69151	69151	she	2203	“ Emilio was sent home on the Stella Maris , ”
69154	69166	69151	69151	she	2203	“ That 's why the signal went dead three years ago . "
69268	69275	69276	69276	she	2203	“ If they have n't left ... ”
69280	69289	69276	69276	she	2203	“ Oh , God , oh , please ... "
69349	69352	69353	69353	she	2203	“ Yes ! "
69735	69744	69727	69727	he	261	“ Would you object to a civil ceremony ? ”
69745	69758	69759	69759	Gina	275	“ That would certainly be nicer than shouting abuse at one another , ”
69785	69788	69759	69759	Gina	275	“ When ? "
69789	69816	69817	69817	Gina	275	“ You and Celestina are going to the mountains with your parents at the end of August , yes ? So : first weekend in September . ”
69821	69828	69829	69829	she	275	“ Maybe late in the afternoon ? "
69841	69863	69829	69829	she	275	" That way , if the marriage a does n't work out , we wo n't have wasted the whole day . ”
69864	69868	69869	69869	Emilio	261	“ Ten o'clock , ”
69872	69888	69869	69869	Emilio	261	“ Ten in the morning . September third , the Saturday after you get home . ”

70208	70210	70197	70197	she	275	“ Funny ”
70285	70431	70432	70432	Caro	488	" Interesting . ' Most of these , she believed , would be rejected out of hand : requests for interviews , book contracts , and so on . There was , however , a letter from a legal firm in Cleveland , Ohio , written in English , and this envelope included a copy of a handwritten note dated July 19 , 2021 , signed with a name Gina recognized : Anne Edwards , the physician who had gone , along with her husband , the engineer George Edwards , to Rakhat as part of the first Jesuit mission . Emilio had spoken of Anne , briefly and with difficulty , so Gina hesitated before reopening this wound . But concerned that this was a matter of legal importance , she brought the letter to Emilio and saw his color vanish as he read . "
70443	70444	70445	70445	I	0	" “
70455	70480	70445	70445	I	0	" he said , shaking his head , throwing the papers down on his desk . He stood and walked away , clearly upset . "
70489	70494	70483	70483	I	0	" CHILDREN OF GOD 151 "
70501	70531	70483	70483	I	0	" Celestina asked , sitting on the floor . Alarmed , she looked from one grown - up 's face to the other 's , and dissolved into tears . "
70540	70541	70538	70538	Mamma	266	" “
70547	70563	70538	70538	Mamma	266	” Emilio said and went to the child , kneeling to offer her his arms . "
70582	70598	70577	70577	Celestina	420	” He looked up at Gina , who shrugged unhappily : what can we do ? "
70606	70613	70617	70617	cara	5228	” Emilio told the child then . “
70653	70687	70696	70696	It	2280	” The note from Anne was short , written on a sunlit day during the excitement of the preparations for the first mission to Rakhat , with mortality only a vague theoretical notion . “
70711	71503	70696	70696	It	2280	” She and George had set up trust funds for each member of the Jesuit party and , with over forty years to accumulate , the law firm informed him , the individual portfolios had done handsomely . In addition , Emilio Sandoz had been named a beneficiary of the Edwardses ' personal estate , along with Sofia Mendes and James Quinn . In the judgment of the law firm , Sandoz was also legally due one - third of that estate . The terms of the will stipulated that while Sandoz remained a member of the Society of Jesus , he would be invited to serve on the board of trustees to help oversee distribution of the funds to charities benefiting education and medicine . However , if he decided for any reason to leave the active priesthood , the money was his to use as he a saw fit . Frightened by the bequest , ignorant of its management , he lost sleep over it that first night . But in the morning , he contacted Brother Edward Behr , who 'd been a stockbroker before joining the Society , and mulled Ed 's advice over , gradually getting used to the fact that he was now a remarkably wealthy man . The decision came a week or so after first reading Anne 's note . Getting out of bed , he accessed listings for antique furniture dealers in the Rome and Naples region , eventually logging a request for estimates on availability and price for one item . That done , he went back to bed . He fell asleep the moment his head touched the pillow , and took that for a good omen . Entering his Neapolitan office during one of his periodic visits several days later , Vincenzo Giuliani was startled to find in it a superb seventeenth - century table , its highly polished and intricately inlaid surface gleaming in the sunlight that poured through tall , mullioned windows . The table was not , the Father General noted , an exact match for the 152 Mary Doria Russell one Emilio Sandoz had wrecked eleven months earlier , but it was close enough . On it was an envelope containing a paper confirmation of the transfer to the Society of Jesus of a breathtaking sum of money , drawn on the private account of E. J. Sandoz . All of which elicited from the Father General a lengthy and meditative curse . Debts paid , in possession of more than sufficient funds to shelter himself and to hire his own bodyguards and support a family , Emilio Sandoz was at forty - seven an independent man , ghosts laid to rest , guilt fading , God renounced . It 's not too late to live , he thought . So it was decided : a civil ceremony , on the morning of September 3 , with a few friends in attendance . a THAT SUMMER , DETAILED REPORTS OF WHAT GINA GIULIANI AND Emilio Sandoz had every right to believe was a purely private matter rose along the lines of hierarchy in three ancient organizations , reaching at various velocities the Father General of the Society of Jesus , the Supreme Pontiff of the Roman Catholic Church and the Neapolitan Capo di Tutti Capi , each of whom was interested for different but dovetailing reasons . In the face of this unfortunate new circumstance , their collective decision was to accelerate preparations for the latest attempt to reach Rakhat . The ship chosen for this voyage was now fully configured for interstellar travel . Carlo Giuliani had christened it the Giordano Bruno , after a Florentine priest burned at the stake in 1600 for suggesting that the stars were like Sol , and might be orbited by other planets where life could exist . The Bruno was highly automated ; her crew was small but competent and experienced . Her Jesuit passengers ' training was nearing completion . Food , trade goods , medical supplies and communications and survival gear were already being ferried to the Bruno , now in low Earth orbit . Navigation programs were locked in for launch in mid - September of 2061 . There was no need to convey any urgency to Sandoz . Indeed , the Jesuits assigned to the mission were very nearly exhausted by the pace he set , for he meant to finish the K’San analysis by August 31 if it killed them all , and threw himself into the project with astonishing energy . Bedridden less than two years earlier , the linguist 's first word to John Candotti had been a bewildered question : “
71506	71680	71681	71681	Christ	259	" Now Emilio was in nearly constant motion , pacing the length of the library , explaining , reasoning , arguing , gesturing , shifting with lightning suddenness from K’San CHILDREN OF GOD 153 to Latin to Ruanja to English ; then , he was suddenly still , thinking , dark hair falling over his eyes and tossed back with a jerk of the head as the answer to some puzzle came to him , and the pacing began again . Gina , fuel for this engine , came each evening at eight to pry him out of the library , and in some ways the other men welcomed her arrival as much as Emilio did . Without her intervention , Sandoz would have gone on hours more , and the bigger men were usually famished by the day 's end and looked forward , in spite of themselves , to hearing Celestina 's piping voice call to Don Emilio and her small footsteps clattering down the long hallway from the front door . "
71698	71745	71692	71694	a wee cherub	2282	” Sean Fein muttered one night , watching the three of them leave . He turned from the window , face sour , his features a collection of short horizontal lines : a small , lipless mouth , deep - set eyes , a snub nose . "
71748	71753	71692	71694	a wee cherub	2282	” he quoted lugubriously , “
71762	71763	71764	71766	St. Thomas More	494	” “
71777	71789	71764	71766	St. Thomas More	494	” Vincenzo Giuliani commented dryly , walking into the library unexpectedly . “
71795	71807	71808	71810	The old orders	2284	” he said , when the others got to their feet . “
71825	71833	71835	71835	you	2287	” he pointed out reasonably to Sean . “
71845	71846	71835	71835	you	2287	" “
71866	71873	71835	71835	you	2287	” said Sean with luxurious cynicism . “
71888	71940	71835	71835	you	2287	" Giuliani bought himself time by strolling through the library , lifting reports from desks , smiling a greeting to John Candotti , nodding to Daniel Iron Horse and Joseba Urizarbarrena . As troubled by the situation as he was personally , Giuliani decided it was time to address the issue . “
71955	71988	71835	71835	you	2287	” he told the others lightly , sitting with a window at his back so that he could see their faces clearly in the waning light , while his own was obscured . “
72071	72093	72108	72108	I	0	" He paused , and looked around as the younger men shifted uncomforta 154 Mary Doria Russell ably in their chairs . “
72111	72155	72108	72108	I	0	" the Father General asked , brows up with mild curiosity . The Father General was looking at Daniel Iron Horse as he said this , but it was Sean Fein who threw his head back and closed his eyes with schoolboy earnestness . “
72179	72187	72103	72103	Emilio	418	” he recited in a loud monotone , “
72237	72252	72103	72103	Emilio	418	” Having delivered himself of this statement , Sean looked around with theatrical melancholy . “
72271	72276	72103	72103	Emilio	418	” he reminded them , “
72287	72303	72278	72278	I	0	” Giuliani sighed . It was time , he decided , to unmask the chemist . “
72378	72409	72410	72410	You	2299	” Noting with aesthetic pleasure the way Sean 's pink flush was set off by his blue eyes , Giuliani returned to the task at hand without missing a beat . “
72470	72484	72464	72464	I	0	" It was Joseba Urizarbarrena who put the problem in its starkest terms . “
72487	72493	72464	72464	I	0	" the ecologist asked quietly , “
72509	72537	72464	72464	I	0	" John Candotti 's eyes dropped , and Sean snorted , looking away , but the Father General 's gaze remained on the mission 's father superior . “
72549	72560	72464	72464	I	0	” Giuliani said , looking directly at Daniel Iron Horse . “
72572	72634	72635	72635	I	0	” For a long time , the quiet was unbroken by any sound elsewhere in the house . Then the silence was ripped by the the abrasive squeal of wooden chair legs grating against the stone floor . Danny stood looking at Vincenzo Giuliani for a few moments , his small , black eyes hard in the broad , pitted face . “
72640	72657	72635	72635	I	0	” he said , throwing down a stylus , and left . a CHILDREN OF GOD 155 “
72666	72700	72659	72659	you	0	" Giuliani said mildly , and followed Iron Horse out of the room . DANNY WAS WAITING FOR HIM IN THE GARDEN : CONSCIENCE INCARNATE , a massive presence in the deepening darkness . “

72743	72766	72767	72767	Ignatius	341	" Giuliani sat on one of the garden benches and gazed upward , picking out the few bright constellations visible at twilight . “

72843	72849	72850	72850	You	0	” He looked at Danny . “

72950	73014	72947	72947	My	0	” the Father General said , almost smiling . The evening seemed oddly still . In his childhood , Vince Giuliani had loved the sound of swamp peepers , trilling in every low spot , filling the summer dusk with wordless song . Here in Italy , he heard only the treble rasp of crickets , and the night seemed poorer for it . “
73040	73053	72947	72947	My	0	" He leaned back , hands clasped and untrembling in his lap . “

73289	73297	73286	73286	I	0	” He stood and began to pace . “
73399	73418	73421	73421	him	261	” He stopped , coming to rest in front of the younger man , and spoke very softly . “
73464	73474	73475	73475	Danny	385	” He looked away into the darkness and said , “
73502	73533	73538	73538	my	0	” And then he was moving again , the pacing an outward sign of the inward argument that had drowned out prayer and faith and peace for nearly a year . “
73586	73602	73603	73603	Danny	385	” he said , his voice betraying the tears that glistened now in the moonlight . “
73673	73709	73722	73725	Self - serving horseshit	2319	” Giuliani stopped and , in the shadowed , shifting night , he searched the other man 's face for understanding , and knew that he had been heard , that his words had registered . "
73714	73721	73722	73725	Self - serving horseshit	2319	" Danny said , backing away . "

73933	73937	73880	73880	he	996	” Danny cried . “

He hesitated , half - turned , and then went back to the garage door and knocked . There were light , quick footsteps on the stairway and he heard the metallic snick of the hook being flicked out of its eye . Sandoz appeared and the two men stood silently for a time , adjusting their reactions , each having thought Gina might be on the other side of the door . “
74117	74123	74113	74115	Father Iron Horse	257	” Emilio said at last , “
74134	74140	74113	74115	Father Iron Horse	257	” Danny blinked , startled . “
74160	74223	74224	74224	I	0	” Sandoz had been halfway to bed , but he put the braces back on and went to his cupboard for two glasses and a bottle of Ronrico , carefully pouring out a measure for each of them , his bioengineered dexterity now strangely graceful . He sat across the table from Iron Horse and inclined his head , willing to listen . “
74229	74234	74224	74224	I	0	” Danny told him . “

74338	74347	74311	74311	your	2333	” he observed , pouring himself another shot . “
74375	74376	74372	74372	you	2333	” "
74382	74390	74378	74378	you	2333	" Danny asked with an odd intentness . “

74418	74441	74442	74442	Sandoz	261	" Iron Horse sat hunched over his untouched drink , his elbows almost reaching both corners of his side of the table . “
74444	74452	74442	74442	Sandoz	261	” he asked after a little while , “
74468	74482	74483	74483	I	0	" Emilio snorted , and picked up his glass , taking a sip . “
74502	74506	74488	74488	I	0	” he murmured , “

74566	74575	74553	74553	Nietzsche	499	” Emilio said crisply , cutting him off . “

74593	74598	74591	74591	Sandoz	261	” Danny said carefully , “
74608	74632	74600	74600	Jesus	259	" Emilio leaned back in his chair and stared now with the stony contempt of a boxer about to level an inadequate opponent . “
74643	74664	74633	74633	You	261	” he advised , but Iron Horse would not drop his gaze . Sandoz shrugged : I gave fair warning : “
74675	74684	74685	74685	I	0	" he said softly , and Danny blinked . “
74717	74718	74719	74719	My	0	” “
74726	74744	74719	74720	My brother	1794	” Danny said , reaching for the glass of rum and putting it at arm 's length . “

74885	74892	74873	74873	Danny	385	" He glanced at a clock . "
74908	74936	74873	74873	Danny	385	" His smile faded as he looked at Iron Horse ; it was strangely affecting to see that big and unemotional man on the verge of tears . “
74945	74949	74873	74873	Danny	385	” Emilio asked . "
74991	75001	75002	75002	Danny	385	” Iron Horse looked away , his eyes glittering . “
75004	75008	75002	75002	Danny	385	” Emilio ventured , “

75025	75030	75031	75031	I	0	” Danny said finally . “
75054	75101	75052	75052	Sandoz	261	” Confused , Emilio frowned . Danny seemed to think he was revealing some great secret , but everybody knew that the Father General 's family was Camorra . At a loss , and looking for a way out , Emilio could only change the subject . “
75173	75188	75141	75141	Giuliani	262	” Danny seemed distracted , but dragged himself back to what Sandoz was saying . "
75198	75199	75141	75141	Giuliani	262	" “
75211	75215	75205	75205	I	0	” Danny shrugged . “

75428	75441	75420	75421	Mary Doria	264	” The more he thought about it , the likelier it seemed . “

75538	75544	75545	75545	he	385	“ Sure enough , ace , ”
75550	75560	75561	75561	He	385	“ Look . It 's still coded and compressed . "
75573	75583	75584	75584	Sandoz	261	" Wow . There 's a lot of it , "
75591	75618	75619	75619	He	261	" Some more stuff by Marc . Joseba will be pleased . Yes ! There 's mine . I knew I 'd done that work already . ”
75632	75639	75640	75640	Sandoz	261	“ There 's something for you , ”
75649	75657	75640	75640	Sandoz	261	“ Sofia was working on trade networks ... "
75663	75680	75658	75658	His	261	“ Wait . Wait , wait , wait . Go back ! Can you stop it ? "

75701	75714	75658	75658	His	261	” Iron Horse said . Sandoz had spun away , breathing hard . “
75725	75729	75658	75658	His	261	” he whispered . "
75741	75748	75736	75736	I	0	” Danny twisted in his chair . “
75757	75758	75751	75751	you	0	" “
75765	75844	75845	75845	Sandoz	261	" Sandoz said abruptly . Danny vacated the desk chair and Sandoz sat down in front of the display . He seemed to settle himself , as though to take a blow , and then carefully spoke the ID and date stamp again , bringing up the last set of files held in the queue , which were logged , impossibly , months after his own final transmission , now some eighteen years in the past on Rakhat . "
75859	75883	75854	75854	I	0	” Frightened by the other man 's pallor , Danny leaned over Sandoz 's shoulder and looked at the file on the display . “
75889	76086	75886	75886	my	0	” he said blankly . During the past months , as he had studied the mission reports and the scientific papers sent back by the Stella Maris party , Daniel Iron Horse had sometimes , with a strange feeling of unfocused guilt , called up images of the artificial - intelligence analyst Sofia Mendes : digitized and radiotransmitted watercolors painted by Father Marc Robichaux , the naturalist on the first mission . The earliest of these was done on Rakhat , during Sofia 's wedding to the astronomer Jimmy Quinn ; others were painted later , as pregnancy softened the classical lines of her face . When Danny CHILDREN OF GOD 161 had first seen these portraits , he thought that Robichaux must have idealized her , for Sofia Mendes was as beautiful as a Byzantine Annunciation in the last painting , done only days before her death in the Kashan massacre . But when , for comparison , Danny had pulled up one of the few archived photos of Sofia , he could only acknowledge the scientific accuracy of Robichaux 's draftsmanship . Brains and beauty and guts , everyone agreed . An extraordinary woman ... "
76092	76103	76089	76090	my God	1886	” Daniel Iron Horse repeated , staring at the screen . “
76109	76115	76116	76116	I	0	” Sandoz whispered , trembling . “

76165	76169	76162	76162	You	2360	” said Isaac . “

76202	76206	76191	76191	I	0	" said Isaac . “
76212	76240	76191	76191	I	0	" Sofia urged , the child in question then only a season old and asleep in her arms , a curled ball of fur and latent energy . “
76252	76253	76246	76246	she	441	" “
76258	76312	76246	76246	she	441	" said Isaac . Sofia glanced down , the rare error in pronunciation catching her attention . There had been a time when the sound of Isaac 's voice had flooded her with joy and relief ; now she knew this was merely echolaliacompulsive , toneless parroting — meaningless , and intensely irritating . “
76319	76323	76313	76313	I	0	” Supaari cried . “
76331	76332	76327	76327	I	0	" “
76336	76408	76327	76327	I	0	” Supaari rose abruptly from their leafy asylum and walked away , only to face Sofia again , his heavy tail sweeping a circular swath in the ground litter . He seemed completely unaware of the gesture , but Sofia had seen it often enough in the past few months to know that it was a mime of staking out territory . He meant to hold his ground in this argument . “
76471	76475	76477	76477	Isaac	363	" Our own , ”
76703	76714	76715	76715	Supaari	286	“ Sandoz told me you have stupid meat on Earth , ”
76723	76730	76715	76715	Supaari	286	“ Meat of not - people — ”
76732	76737	76715	76715	Supaari	286	“ Not - people . "
76739	76756	76715	76715	Supaari	286	" Supaari , this place is rich with meat ! You could eat piyanot . Or cranil ”
76758	76761	76715	76715	Supaari	286	“ Cranil . "
76763	76771	76772	76772	Supaari	286	“ And how shall I catch them ? ”
76776	76811	76812	76812	He	286	“ Piyanot are too fast and cranil too big — they'd roll and crush a hunter who tried to a take them ! We have always only eaten Runa , who can be caught — "
76824	76830	76831	76831	Supaari	286	“ Do you see this ? "
76840	76888	76831	76831	Supaari	286	" We are made only for prey so slow as this child ! If the Runa did not come to us to be killed , the cities would starve in less than a season . This is why we have to breed them . We need them — "
76889	76958	76831	76831	Supaari	286	“ Supaari , let Isaac go . The child 's habitual stillness had become utter immobility , but he did not cry out or weep in fear . Supaari released the boy instantly , his ears drop- 164 Mary Doria Russell ping in apology . There was no visible response from Isaac , but Sofia let out a breath and looked up at the Jana'ata looming over her . “
76966	76980	76831	76831	Supaari	286	” she said evenly , and when Supaari did , she told him , “
76999	77000	76988	76989	The Runa	429	” "
77003	77012	76988	76989	The Runa	429	” said Isaac , as tonelessly as before . “
77030	77052	77053	77053	Sofia	356	” Supaari insisted . Kneeling , he stared at the baby lying in her arms , but then lifted his eyes . “
77086	77093	77083	77084	the Runa	429	” he said with soft desperation . “
77105	77106	77098	77098	They	429	" “
77109	77147	77098	77098	They	429	” They both noticed Isaac 's word this time , and it hung in the air with everything it implied left unsaid . She reached out to run the back of her hand along a lupine cheek . “
77156	77158	77153	77153	I	0	” ( “
77161	77163	77164	77164	I	0	” ) “
77193	77216	77217	77217	I	0	” He stopped again , gathering courage , throwing his head back to look at her from the distance of his pride . “
77230	77250	77217	77217	I	0	” She tried to say something , but he went on resolutely , before Isaac could mimic his words . “
77271	77272	77274	77274	your	286	” “
77277	77301	77274	77274	your	286	” said Isaac . He glanced at the adults then : a momentary flicker of direct attention so fleeting that neither noticed it . "
77318	77496	77315	77315	my	0	” Sofia was murmuring in rueful Hebrew . Mama , she thought , I know he has a tail , but I think he wants to convert . How could she say no ? She had waited out these six endless , fruitless months on the bare chance that her radio beacon might bring a response from unknown humans . Right here , so close she could feel the heat from his body , was a man she knew and cared for , and was beginning to understand . Less alien to her than her own son , more like her than she could have imagined a few years earlier , just as ashamed to discover that his gratitude to the Runa was insufficient to overcome a gnawing need to think a single thought uninterrupted by endless talk , to make a single gesture disregarded and uncommented on , to be able to take a walk without incurring the gentle , insistent Runa dismay that followed any temporary escape from the group . CHILDREN OF GOD 165 a “

77545	77558	77559	77559	We	2392	" ) They sat a while longer , each sunk in thought . "
77567	77574	77559	77559	We	2392	” Sofia said after a time . “
77581	77583	77559	77559	We	2392	” ( “
77590	77692	77587	77587	Supaari	286	" ) She almost missed it , so nearly immune was she to her son 's toneless voice . Supaari sings . She had to replay the sound in her head to be certain . My God , she thought . Isaac said , Supaari sings . She did not engulf her son in an embrace or scream or weep or even move , but only glanced at Supaari , as surprised as she and as immobile . She had seen too often the way Isaac drained himself away — became Not There in some mysterious fashion when he was touched . “
77697	77724	77725	77725	Supaari	286	” Sofia said in an ordinary voice , as though this was a normal child who had simply made a comment for his mother to confirm . “
77734	77735	77736	77736	Supaari	286	" “
77742	77751	77736	77736	Supaari	286	" They waited , breathless in the heat . “
77755	78002	77736	77736	Supaari	286	” Supaari blinked , mouth open , so human in his reaction Sofia nearly laughed . His daughter in her arms , Sofia lifted her chin : For Isaac , Supaari . He stood then and went nearer to Isaac , alert to the smooth , small muscles , to the barely perceptible quiver that would precede flight . By some instinct never before exercised in such a manner , he knew that he should not face the boy , so Supaari knelt at Isaac 's side and sang to the child , softly and unseen . Sofia held her breath as the first notes of the evening chant floated out to join the forest choir of cries and hoots , of buzzing rasps and fluting whistles . Listened as Supaari 's bass — melodic and fluid — was joined by a child 's soprano , unerringly on pitch , word - perfect , but in miraculous harmony . Gazed with her one myopic , tear - blurred eye at her son 's face , incandescent in the roseate light : transfigured , alive — truly alive for the first time . And blessed the God of her ancestors , for granting them life , for sustaining them , for allowing them to reach this new season . When the chant drew to a close , she filled her lungs with air that seemed perfumed with music . Voice steady , face wet on one side , "

78370	78471	78472	78472	She	356	“ This is Sofia Mendes , of the Stella Maris party . Today is March 5 , 2047 , Earth - relative . I have waited 165 days local time for a response to my call from any human on Rakhat . This message serves notice that I am planning to leave this planet in fifteen days Rakhatrelative , using the Magellan 's lander to get to the mother ship . If you ca n't get to the lander by that time , you will be marooned here . I regret this , but I can not wait any longer . ”
78504	78514	78515	78515	Kanchay	307	" Someone was wondering when you would go home , ”
78518	78540	78515	78515	Kanchay	307	“ You 'll need to bring goods back to your people , or they 'll think your journey was a failure . ”

79214	79217	79218	79218	she	275	" Nothing , ”
79226	79241	79242	79242	Emilio	261	" Which means that something is . Even an ex - priest knows that ! ”
79367	79375	79376	79376	Gina	275	“ Baseball uniforms are ugly , too , ”
79590	79593	79594	79594	he	261	“ Celestina , ”
79598	79606	79594	79594	he	261	“ it 's time for I Bambini . ”
79628	79635	79636	79636	he	261	“ Let 's try this again , ”
79646	79651	79636	79636	he	261	“ What 's wrong ? ”
79675	79684	79670	79670	her	275	“ You should go back to find Sofia ! "
79738	79743	79744	79744	he	261	“ Who told you ? ”
79749	79758	79759	79759	she	275	“ Do n't look at me like that , ”
79762	79767	79768	79768	he	261	" Who told you ? "
79778	79801	79802	79802	Gina	275	" What difference does it make who told me ? She 's alive . That poor woman — she 's all alone ! "
79827	79844	79845	79845	He	261	“ You should go back to rescue her . She needs you . You loved her . ”
79852	79855	79856	79856	he	261	" One , "
79861	79929	79856	79856	he	261	" It makes a difference because I intend to kill whoever told you . Two . All we know for certain is that she was alive in 2047 . Three . The Giordano Bruno wo n't reach Rakhat for another seventeen years . The probability of finding her alive , having survived alone on Rakhat to the age of seventy - one , approaches zero . Four — ”
79930	79940	79951	79951	his	261	“ I hate it when you 're like this ! ”
79941	79944	79945	79945	he	261	" Four ! ”
79955	80024	80025	80025	he	261	" Sofia Mendes was the single most competent person I have ever met . I assure you that she would find laughable the concept of needing me , of all people , to rescue her ! Five . Yes . I loved her ! I also loved Anne , and D.W. , and Askama . I did n't marry any of them . Gina , look at me ! "
80051	80086	80087	80087	Gina	275	" If Sofia Mendes miraculously walked in that door at this moment , alive , well and in the bloom of her youth , it would change nothing between you and me . Nothing ! ”

80142	80194	80130	80130	she	2436	“ The magistrate . I want him here . Now . We are getting married this afternoon . Then I am going to call the tailor and cancel the order for that damned suit . And then I am going to murder Vincenzo Giuliani and probably Daniel Iron Horse as well — ”
80195	80201	80202	80202	Celestina	420	“ Why is Mamma crying ? "
80225	80232	80219	80219	Gina	275	“ It 's nothing , cara — "
80233	80248	80249	80249	Emilio	261	“ It 's not nothing ! It 's important and she deserves to understand , "
80273	80301	80262	80262	He	261	“ Your mamma is afraid that I might leave her , Celestina . She thinks I could love someone else more than I love her , cara . "
80302	80307	80308	80308	Celestina	420	“ But you do . ”
80312	80318	80308	80308	Celestina	420	“ You love me best . ”
80328	80332	80333	80333	she	275	“ Go ahead , ”
80344	80349	80350	80350	He	261	“ Handle this one . ”
80369	80372	80373	80373	he	261	“ You , ”
80380	80396	80373	80373	he	261	“ are my very best little girl and your mamma is my very best wife . ”
80431	80455	80419	80419	he	261	“ Which is to say , she will be my very best wife as soon as I can get the magistrate out here — ”
80456	80459	80461	80461	Gina	275	" No , "
80480	80501	80472	80472	She	275	“ It 's all right . I needed to hear it , I guess . We can wait until September . ”
80521	80531	80507	80507	her	275	“ And do n't you dare cancel that suit ! ”
80584	80598	80599	80599	he	261	" I am not Carlo , Gina . I will never leave you , "
80658	80674	80649	80649	his	261	“ I love you , and I love Celestina , and I am yours forever . ”
80675	80678	80680	80680	Celestina	420	" Well , ”
80696	80707	80680	80680	Celestina	420	“ I 'm certainly pleased we 've straightened that out ! "
80734	80752	80753	80753	Gina	275	“ I never said that . Do you say that ? Where does she get this stuff ? ”
80762	80780	80781	80781	he	261	“ That was really good ! Do n't you recognize it ? Valeria Golina -- La Contessa ! ”
80784	80805	80781	80781	he	261	“ No - wait , you fell asleep on the sofa , but Celestina and I watched it last Sunday . ”
80824	80836	80808	80808	his	261	" She was doing Valeria Golina . That was really good ! ”
80945	80953	80954	80954	Gina	275	“ You 're very good at that , ”
80981	80984	80985	80985	he	261	“ Dazzling , ”
80990	81012	80985	80985	he	261	“ I used to work in the house laundry . Would you like me to come with you to the mountains ? "
81019	81026	81013	81013	She	275	“ And if you 're recognized ? "
81027	81039	81040	81040	he	261	" I 'll wear dark glasses and a hat and gloves , ”
81049	81054	81055	81055	she	275	“ And a trenchcoat ? "
81059	81066	81055	81055	she	275	“ Caro , it 's August . "
81067	81076	81077	81077	he	261	“ All right , what about a veil ? ”
81092	81109	81055	81055	she	275	“ Nothing flashy — not an embroidered silk veil hung with gold coins . Something tasteful ! ”
81115	81121	81122	81122	He	261	“ Silver coins , perhaps . ”
81133	81149	81122	81122	He	261	“ If I 'm recognized , I 'm recognized ! I 'll deal with it . "
81193	81196	81197	81197	he	261	“ Okay , ”
81204	81214	81197	81197	he	261	“ maybe it 's not such a great idea . "
81215	81233	81234	81234	she	275	“ You 've got to finish the K’San project for the Jesuits . They 're leaving soon , ”
81238	81246	81255	81255	he	261	“ Maybe next year for the mountains ? "
81264	81277	81278	81278	he	261	“ The Society is going to release the scientific papers in October , ”
81284	81333	81278	81278	he	261	“ I have been thinking that perhaps the best way to handle it really is to call a news conference . Spend a whole day , if necessary . As long as it takes . Be done with it . Answer every damned question they throw at me — "
81334	81343	81344	81344	She	275	“ And then come home to your family . ”
81369	81375	81376	81376	he	261	“ Do people still dance ? ”
81380	81391	81376	81376	he	261	“ Someday , I would like to take you dancing . ”
81392	81397	81398	81398	she	275	“ Yes , caro , ”
81402	81407	81398	81398	she	275	“ People still dance . ”
81408	81411	81412	81412	he	261	" Good , ”
81474	81479	81480	81480	she	420	" We 're starving ! "
81499	81506	81507	81507	Emilio	261	“ Note , if you will , ”
81517	81538	81507	81507	Emilio	261	“ that she made sure to fall onto the bedroom carpet , rather than the tiled floor of the hall . ”
81545	81555	81556	81556	Pia	461	" Will you make us macaroni and cheese again ? "
81571	81591	81558	81558	Emilio	261	“ Just like last time ? Please , please , please . Extra soupy ? With lots of milk ? "
81616	81623	81627	81627	him	261	“ Pia , call your mother , ”
81636	81680	81627	81627	him	261	“ And ask if you may stay for sup- 174 Mary Doria Russell per . Celestina , you set the table . Lots of milk , the lady says ! Why is it you can never find a cow when you need one ... "
81755	81761	81762	81762	she	275	" Is it for me ? "
81769	81773	81774	81774	he	261	“ Who else ? ”
81786	81796	81797	81797	Emilio	261	“ This is a magic box , you know , ”
81820	81828	81808	81808	Celestina	516	“ You can keep words in it . ”
81853	81865	81866	81866	he	261	“ Take the top off for me , if you please , ”
81898	81920	81927	81927	I	0	“ Now . Get ready because you have to put the top back on very quickly after I say the words . ”
81945	81951	81942	81942	he	261	“ Ti amo , cara , "
81956	81964	81942	81942	he	261	“ Quick ! Get that top on ! "
81978	81987	81988	81988	he	261	“ Whew ! That was close . Now , ”
81997	82006	81988	81988	he	261	“ tap the top and count to ten . ”
82007	82010	82030	82030	Gina	275	“ Why ? "
82011	82026	82027	82027	he	261	" Why , why , why ! We do n't beat this child enough , ”
82037	82053	82027	82027	he	261	“ In my day , kids did as they were told , no questions asked . ”
82059	82062	82063	82063	she	516	“ Why ? "
82068	82081	82082	82082	he	261	“ To let the words know they 're supposed to stay inside , ”
82096	82111	82112	82112	he	261	“ Do as you 're told . Tap the top and count to ten ! ”
82167	82182	82160	82160	He	261	“ Now , open it , and put it right next to your ear . ”
82224	82231	82208	82208	she	516	“ I do n't hear anything ! ”
82238	82246	82232	82232	Celestina	516	“ I think you 're goofing me . ”
82251	82256	82257	82257	he	261	" Try it again , "
82264	82273	82261	82261	he	261	“ This time , listen with your heart . ”
82366	82369	82433	82433	Emilio	261	" Good night ”
82391	82395	82387	82387	they	2473	“ Sweet dreams , "
82409	82422	82423	82423	she	275	“ You are going to be the greatest papa in world history , ”
82435	82440	82441	82441	he	261	“ Depend on it , ”
82466	82482	82453	82453	He	261	“ You could save me a lot of embarrassment if you had a headache tonight . ”
82487	82491	82453	82453	He	261	“ Your hands ? ”
82518	82529	82508	82508	she	275	" Caro , we have our whole lives for it . ”
82558	82584	82585	82585	Emilio	261	“ Don Vincenzo told me they found another surgeon for you last May , but you would n't see him . Why not , caro ? "
82600	82644	82585	82585	Emilio	261	“ You heal well enough now . They can do amazing things , Emilio . Reglove the hands with artificial skin , reposition some tendons to take advantage of the nerves that were n't cut . You 'd have much better function afterward . "
82645	82653	82654	82654	He	261	“ I 'm used to the braces . ”
82661	82686	82654	82654	He	261	“ Look . I 've had enough , okay ? I do n't want to start all over learning how to use my hands . ”
82737	82754	82734	82736	Mary Doria Russell	516	“ The phantom neuralgia wo n't be any worse afterward — it might even be better . "
82763	82770	82771	82771	he	261	“ I 'll think about it , ”
82777	82787	82771	82771	he	261	“ Not right away . I need some time . ”
82788	82795	82796	82796	she	275	“ Maybe after New Year 's , ”
82800	82803	82804	82804	he	261	“ Maybe , ”
82807	82815	82804	82804	he	261	“ I do n't know . Maybe . ”
82943	82955	82956	82956	she	275	“ Do n't you want to wait until after the wedding ? "
82964	82977	82978	82978	he	261	“ Why ? Are you going to run away with the money ? "
82990	83040	83041	83041	She	275	" No , I just want you to take your parents out for dinner a few times . Someplace nice , yes ? And tell them it was my idea ! I want credit . A son - in - law has to think about this kind of thing . "
83327	83343	83344	83345	Carlo Giuliani	284	“ REALLY , SANDOZ , I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT SULKING WAS BEneath your dignity , ”
83371	83402	83353	83353	Nico	518	“ It 's your own fault , you know . You were given every opportunity to volunteer . This attitude will get you nothing but bedsores and a bladder infection . ”
83444	83452	83453	83453	Carlo	284	“ Do you enjoy opera , Sandoz ? "
83460	83464	83457	83457	Nico	518	“ Nessun dorma , ”
83470	83493	83494	83494	He	284	“ Most Neapolitans are mad for opera . We love the passions , the conflict - life lived on a grand scale . ”
83523	83530	83531	83531	Carlo	284	“ Gina never cared for opera , "
83534	83597	83531	83531	Carlo	284	“ Grandiose nonsense , she called it . A thoroughly boring little housewife , Gina . You should thank me , Sandoz . I have saved you from a stifling fate ! You would not have been content for long to sit at home with her , eating pasta together and getting fat . You and I were meant for greater things . "
83653	83674	83675	83675	he	284	“ We have a great deal a in common , you know — even apart from our use of Gina , ”
83691	83821	83675	83675	he	284	“ We were both despised by our fathers , for example . Papa used to call me Cio - Cio - San . The allusion is to Madama Butterfly , of course . To call me Cio - Cio - San was to accuse me of flitting from one thing to another , do you see ? Since the day of my birth , I have been a bitter disappointment to my father . Like yours , my father saw in my face only evidence of his wife 's , infidelity . There , perhaps , our experience differs : my mother was falsely accused . But it has always been easier for Papa to assume that I am not his than to accept that I am not he . ”
83839	83846	83833	83833	Nico	518	“ Me protegge , me difende ... "
83847	83861	83862	83862	Carlo	284	" I have always been good at anything I put my hand to , ”
83868	83944	83945	83945	Nico	518	“ Every teacher I studied with took an interest in me . Each assumed I 'd be a protégé — an engineer or biologist or pilot . When I refused to follow in their footsteps , they blamed my inconstancy and disloyalty , rather than recognize their own disappointed desire for acolytes . But I am no one 's disciple . My life is my own , and I follow no one else 's path . "
84012	84026	84027	84027	Carlo	284	“ I know what you 're thinking , Sandoz : delusions of grandeur , ”
84031	84100	84101	84101	Carlo	284	“ Men like you and my father excel in a narrow field of a endeavor . You are intent from your youth on one thing , and achieve a great deal early in your lives , and you scorn those who are not similarly focused . My father , for example , took over Naples before he was thirty — it was quite a remarkable rise to power , ”
84104	84217	84101	84101	Carlo	284	“ By the time he was forty , he controlled businesses accounting for eighteen percent of Italy 's gross national product , with an annual income greater than Fiat . At fortytwo , only a year older than I am now , Domenico Giuliani was the head of an empire with tentacles reaching into the whole of Europe , South Africa , the Middle East , the Caribbean and the Americas . An empire larger than a 180 Mary Doria Russell 9 Alexander's — my father would remind me of this at breakfast , nearly every morning . Carlo fell silent for a time . Then he drew himself up and shrugged . “
84296	84311	84346	84346	You	2506	" Finished with his chores and two arias , Nico looked to his padrone . "
84315	84322	84346	84346	You	2506	” Carlo said , on cue . "
84330	84345	84328	84328	Nico	518	” He waited for Nico to leave before standing and moving to the bedside . “
84389	84417	84366	84369	a very fine nurse	2507	” He glanced at the readouts , but this time Gina 's name provoked no change in the life - sign data now flowing to the monitors . “
84426	84447	84366	84369	a very fine nurse	2507	" said Carlo Giuliani , looking down at the man who 'd very nearly married his own ex - wife . "
84493	84510	84490	84490	she	275	” He opened the sick - bay door , standing there for a time without leaving . “
84531	85304	84519	84519	She	275	" It was not until the sick - bay hatch was shut and locked from the outside that the readouts changed . CARLO HAD SENT THREE OF THEM FOR HIM . THEY KNEW HE'D BEEN A priest and were , perhaps , complacent in that knowledge . They could see that he was small . They were told he had been sick and that his hands were essentially useless . What they did not know was that he was a veteran of a hundred emetic nightmare reenactments of this very experience . Over and over , he relived it and what came afterward . This time , there was no hesitation , no foolish hope , and he did damage before , inevitably , they overpowered him . For weeks afterward , he would remember with satisfaction the feel of a cheekbone giving way under his heel when a face came within striking distance , would recall with pleasure the nasal cry of the man whose nose he broke when he got an elbow loose . a a CHILDREN OF GOD 181 a a He marked them . This time , he made himself felt . He had been beaten before and there was no novelty in it . He rolled with as much as he could , kept tensed and braced for as long as possible , and finally took a savage satisfaction in the silence that would become his principal weapon against them . Unconscious during the trip to the launch site , he was kept under sedation for a time , even after they were on board the Giordano Bruno . But he had sampled product when he was a kid ; familiar with the doped drift between dream and waking , it did not frighten him . Slack and boneless whenever anyone was near , he let them think the dose was enough to put him under , and waited . A chance came while the crew was occupied with the final preparations for leaving high Earth orbit . Ripping the IV line out of his arm with his teeth , he lay motionless until his head cleared a little , watching his blood mix with the saline and glucose and medication from the pumpwell , dispersing evenly throughout the compartment in a pale iridescent haze that suddenly sank to the floor as the engines fired and the ship began to accelerate . He struggled out of the zero - G moorings that had held him in place ; stood , wobbling slightly ; made his way with the careful balance of a self - conscious drunk to the system access panel in the sick bay . What he could not stop , he could sabotage . A minute error in navigation would be enough to throw them years off course and he meant to change a single number in the navigation calculations . He was caught , and there was another beating , fueled this time by fear of what he 'd almost done . There was blood in his urine a few days afterward , and they did not find it necessary to restrain him that week . It occurred to him that if he had taken this kind of abuse a year ago , it would have killed him . Timing , he thought bitterly , is everything . Throughout the days that followed , he lay still , hating in silence . Sometimes , for a moment , when the sick - bay door opened , he would hear voices . Some were well known . Others were new to him , most notably that of a tenor : unschooled and a little nasal , with a slightly sanded quality that took the brilliance off his top notes , but true and often lovely . He hated them all , without reservation and without exception , with a pure and incandescent outrage that sustained him and replaced the food he would not take . And he resolved to die rather than be used again . a a THERE WERE , OF COURSE , MANY WAYS TO OBTAIN COOPERATION . CARLO had , at one time , considered having Gina and Celestina killed , to loosen 182 Mary Doria Russell > a a Sandoz 's ties to Earth , but had rejected the idea . Sandoz was more likely to commit suicide under those circumstances than to work out his grief in space . Studying his quarry , Carlo settled on a judicious combination of di- , rect force , modern chemistry and traditional threat . “
85313	85345	85305	85305	I	0	” Carlo said briskly , entering the medical bay one morning , after Nico had reported that Sandoz was dressed and calm , and prepared now to discuss the situation rationally . “

85448	85466	85467	85467	I	0	" His speech was a little slurred . Carlo made a mental note to reduce the dosage . “
85523	85529	85530	85530	I	0	” Carlo Giuliani warned regretfully , “

85648	85662	85621	85621	Candotti	378	” There was no reaction but , after a time , Sandoz asked , "
85668	85708	85621	85621	Candotti	378	" Carlo leaned toward a mirrored medicine cabinet for a moment of contemplation , his long - nosed , high - boned face serious under a cap of golden hair , cropped but curling : Apollo come to life . “
85719	85740	85621	85621	Candotti	378	" He shrugged an acknowledgment of the paltriness of such a motive ; in any case , Sandoz had money . “
85756	85765	85770	85770	I	0	” he continued , turning back to Sandoz , “
85792	85843	85770	85770	I	0	” a CHILDREN OF GOD 183 a Sandoz sat for a time , staring at his hands . Carlo watched with unconcealed interest as the man straightened the fingers and then let them drop , their fall from his wrist bones almost beautiful , the ribboning scars faded to ivory . “
85870	85910	85858	85858	you	2521	” Sandoz pointed out with clinical accuracy : he had cross - trained as a medic for the first mission , and was quite knowledgeable about hand anatomy now . Over and over , the fingers straightened and dropped . “
85917	85921	85922	85922	I	0	” he said . “
85937	85980	85929	85929	I	0	” How very Zen , Carlo thought , but he did n't say it . Not that Sandoz would have been angered — nothing could anger him now , although Carlo had taken the precaution of stationing Nico just outside the door . “
85985	85995	85922	85922	I	0	" Sandoz asked , coming back to the point . "

86181	86213	86214	86214	You	0	” Carlo smiled disarmingly and waited for the obvious question , Then why do you need me ? The maimed hands quieted and basilisk eyes lifted to meet Carlo 's own . "

86235	86261	86262	86262	I	0	” Carlo cried good - humoredly . Sitting in the sickbay chair , he rested an ankle on his knee , watching his man carefully . “

86360	86369	86356	86356	Jana'ata	290	” He stopped , his gray eyes unreadable . “

86931	87002	86927	86927	he	526	“ Shall we amuse ourselves ? Shall we plumb our depths ? Surely , even on a journey such as this , the greatest adventure is the exploration of the human soul . I offer you a bargain : you may decide whether or not we liberate the Runa ! We shall pit my thirst for operatic grandeur against your moral strength . An interesting contest , do you agree ? "
87022	87028	87029	87029	he	263	“ John must be anxious , ”
87032	87083	87029	87029	he	263	“ I should like a little time to consider your proposal in full . For now , I give my word not to interfere with your business arrangements . I agree to nothing further , but perhaps that will do as earnest money on what 's left of my soul ? "
87084	87087	87088	87088	Carlo	526	“ Nicely , ”
87094	87099	87088	87088	Carlo	526	“ Very nicely indeed . ”

87493	87551	87474	87474	Carlo	526	“ Both with fuel efficiency and range vastly improved over the lander that failed you in the first mission . And one of mine is a drone that can be operated remotely . I have learned from my predecessors ' mistakes ! The crew of the Giordano Bruno shall not be marooned on the surface of Rakhat ! ”
87563	87567	87568	87568	Sandoz	261	“ Per favore , ”

87985	88001	88002	88002	Carlo	526	” John said , sucking in snot and trying to get a grip on himself . “

88064	88138	88241	88241	'em	0	" His hands were bad , but he let John cling to him in spite of that , and realized with detached interest that the pain was easier to tolerate because he could n't seem to worry that it would be permanent this time . A useful lesson , he thought , looking over John 's head at the exterior hangar doors . They were free of dust and had been cycled recently . "
88142	88146	88241	88241	'em	0	” he said . “

88162	88193	88153	88153	you	0	" John got to his feet on his own and wiped his face , but flopped against the sealed rock wall , looking even more loosely strung together than usual . “
88196	88237	88153	88153	you	0	” he said after a time . When they got to the hatch that led back into the living quarters of the ship , Emilio motioned for John to bang on it , not wanting to jar his own hands . “
88246	88272	88244	88244	John	378	" he said as they waited for the door to be reopened . John looked blank at first , but then nodded and stood straighter . “
88278	88289	88244	88244	John	378	” Emilio Sandoz said quietly , not seeing John anymore . “
88299	88447	88293	88294	the bastards	2582	" a IT WAS NOT NICO BUT SEAN FEIN , LOOKING LIKE THE WRATH OF GOD , WHO reopened the door for them and silently took charge of John , shepherding him around a bulkhead toward the upper - deck cabins . Carlo was nowhere to be seen and Iron Horse was gone as well , but Joseba 's voice , demanding and insistent , could be heard indistinctly from somewhere below the commons . The braces were waiting on the table , where Nico was eating lunch with a square and fleshy person whose gross bulk made a remarkable contrast to his flowery Impressionist coloring : jonquil - yellow hair falling lankly over skin of rosebud pink and eyes of hyacinth blue . 188 Mary Doria Russell a Sandoz sat down and dragged the braces closer , drawing his hands into them , one by one . “
88451	88462	88463	88463	Pilot	7084	” the fat man said , by way of introduction . “

88575	88597	88573	88573	Nico	518	” Nico dabbed at his mouth with a napkin before speaking , careful of his nose , which was faintly discolored . “
88601	88625	88598	88599	Brav scugnizz	534	” he affirmed obediently , liquid brown eyes serious in a skull that was a little small for a man of his size . “
88633	88642	88631	88631	Nico	518	" Sandoz asked without a hint of malice . "
88646	88663	88631	88631	Nico	518	” Nico seemed to be thinking hard about something else , so Sandoz turned to Frans . “
88684	88685	88672	88672	Nico	518	" “

89183	89227	89117	89117	you	263	” said Danny Iron Horse , just behind him . He moved noiselessly around the table and stood behind Nico , across from Sandoz . Frans , feeling very happy , looked from one face to the other like a spectator at Wimbledon . “
89237	89242	89117	89117	you	263	” Iron Horse said . “

89302	89324	89265	89265	I	0	" Sandoz commented . He picked up a knife , examining its edge idly , and then glanced at his plate . “
89339	89353	89354	89354	I	0	" He shrugged , raising his eyes from the blade to Iron Horse . “
89366	89374	89356	89356	I	0	” he said , sounding vaguely surprised , “

89439	89450	89451	89451	Danny	385	” said Iron Horse , and he turned to leave . “
89453	89515	89451	89451	Danny	385	" Sandoz called , as Iron Horse was about to disappear . If the bulkheads had n't been treated with a polymer that made them renow 190 Mary Doria Russell sistant to rupture , the knife would have sunk a good way in ; instead , it bounced off the wall next to Danny 's face and clattered to the floor . “
89527	89535	89451	89451	Danny	385	” Sandoz smiled , cold - eyed . “

89711	89720	89722	89722	him	2603	” When Danny remained silent , he snapped , “
89738	89761	89722	89722	him	2603	” Back stiff against the bulkhead , Daniel Iron Horse spoke , the hollowness of his voice matching that of his rationales . “
89881	89894	89876	89876	God	263	” He paused , and then gave the only reason that mattered . “

90471	90491	90467	90467	Frans	533	“ I was only being polite . It 's okay , Nico . You do n't have to play . ”
90492	90512	90513	90513	Sandoz	263	" I 'd like to send a message home first , if it would n't be too much trouble , ”
90516	90528	90529	90529	Frans	533	“ Radio 's right through that hatch , to your left , ”
90533	90556	90529	90529	Frans	533	“ It 's all set up . Just record the message and hit ‘ send . ' Yell if you need help . "
90557	90562	90563	90563	Sean	390	" Not bloody likely , ”
90596	90600	90592	90592	he	518	“ Fucked again , "
90632	90637	90638	90638	he	518	“ Taken by force , ”
90641	90652	90638	90638	he	518	“ I think of you . Listen with your hearts . ”
90662	90668	90669	90670	THE AMBASSADOR	2625	“ I WON'T HAVE IT , ”
90713	90736	90709	90709	her	5900	“ I 'll resign before I give my daughter to that beast . How dare he ask for a child of mine ! ”
90737	90750	90759	90759	she	2629	“ My lord , Hlavin Kitheri has n't asked for our Sakinja , "
90790	90796	90782	90782	she	2629	“ His invitation was simply — "
90797	90803	90804	90804	Ma	544	“ He is a coward , ”
90812	90819	90804	90804	Ma	544	“ He assassinated his whole family — ”
90820	90824	90828	90828	he	5900	“ Almost certainly , ”
90832	90836	90828	90828	he	5900	“ but unproven . ”
90837	90880	90804	90804	Ma	544	" — and then lied about it ! As though anyone would believe that vaporous nonsense about a merchant — a midlands peddler!—bringing down the whole of a lineage like the Kitheri . And now he dares to ask for my daughter ! ”
90892	90904	90886	90886	Ma	544	“ Suukmel , he buggers animals — and sings about it ! ”
90905	90908	90909	90909	She	5900	“ Admittedly . ”
90944	90964	90965	90965	she	5900	“ Hlavin Kitheri is , as my 194 Mary Doria Russell palord husband points out , many remarkable things , ”
90971	90988	90965	90965	she	5900	“ but he is also a man of admirable breadth of view , a great poet , ”
90989	90993	90994	90995	the ambassador	2625	“ That rubbish ! "
91015	91022	90994	90995	the ambassador	2625	“ He 's mad , Suukmel — "
91023	91061	91062	91062	Suukmel	545	“ Ah , forgive your poor wife , my gracious lord , but ' madness ' is a word used imprecisely , and too often . A careful person might say discontented or desperate or extraordinary instead , ”
91065	91090	91091	91091	She	5900	" Have pity on anyone whose nature is not well suited to a role decreed by birth , for it is a difficult life . ”
91111	91166	91167	91167	Her	5900	“ Hlavin Kitheri has acceded to his Patrimony , my lord . Whatever his past , whatever the circumstances of his rise , whatever your private reservations about his character , it is your public duty as Mala Njer 's ambassador to treat the forty - eighth Paramount as the legitimate ruler of Inbrokar . "
91178	91224	91225	91225	Ma	544	“ Kitheri is a man worth studying , my lord . Even apart from the poetry , his years of exile in Galatna Palace do not appear to have been wasted . He has , shall we say , intimate contacts all over his territory ? ”
91238	91300	91231	91231	she	5900	“ Men of ability and energy , men who now bring to Kitheri information and insight . Ideas . Perspective . Already , in the first season of his reign , he has created new and unprecedented offices and appointed such men to them , even thirds , and he has done this almost without opposition from those who cherish tradition . ”
91335	91350	91351	91351	she	5900	“ It is interesting , is it not ? How has he managed this ? "
91360	91378	91379	91379	she	5900	“ Perhaps my dear lord will discover something of value in your observation of him at court ? "
91382	91396	91379	91379	she	5900	“ In any case , Kitheri is no longer looking for a wife . ”
91397	91412	91462	91462	her	5900	“ Of course not . He 's probably looking for more tailless monsters to couple with—"Then
91418	91424	91462	91462	her	5900	“ What have you heard ? ”
91425	91443	91462	91462	her	5900	" He is affianced , my lord husband . A VaPalkirn child . The regent 's eldest . ”
91444	91454	91379	91379	she	5900	“ Elli'nal ? She 's hardly out of swaddling ! ”
91455	91458	91462	91462	her	5900	“ Precisely . "
91468	91480	91481	91481	she	5900	“ It is a masterly stroke , do n't you agree ! "
91485	91549	91481	91481	she	5900	“ Inbrokar is the central state a a CHILDREN OF GOD 195 of the Triple Alliance , with Mala Njer to the west and Palkirn to the east . A marriage contract with Elli'nal leaves the Palkirn government quiet at Kitheri 's back while the child grows . Then he may deal with his western neighbor , Mala Njer , on pragmatic grounds . ”
91558	91589	91481	91481	she	5900	“ Mala Njer can be many things to Inbrokar , my lord husband . Protector . Partner . Prey . Perhaps Kitheri wishes to reconsider the terms of our alliance . "
91590	91601	91602	91602	Ma	544	“ I have not been informed of this Palkirn marriage , ”
91605	91608	91602	91602	Ma	544	" Nevertheless ... "
91675	91680	91681	91681	Ma	544	" Well , then ! "
91687	91696	91681	91681	Ma	544	" What does Kitheri want with my daughter ? "
91697	91707	91709	91709	Suukmel	545	“ Nothing at all , my own dear master , ”
91712	91728	91709	91709	Suukmel	545	“ It is not your daughter whom Hlavin Kitheri wishes to meet but your wife . ”
91737	91744	91745	91745	he	2645	“ You ca n't be serious , "
91748	91764	91745	91745	he	2645	" Quite serious , my lord . Furthermore , I should like to meet him . "
91782	91784	91775	91776	a woman	5527	“ I ”
91809	91812	91813	91813	Ma	544	“ Impossible , ”
91818	91821	91822	91822	she	5527	" Nevertheless , ”
91924	91927	91928	91928	he	2645	“ Impossible , ”
92415	92422	92423	92424	the Paramount	1334	“ Dreadful , is n't it ? "
92451	92482	92483	92483	He	1334	“ I have begun to hope for a fire . At times , the solution to a maze is to reduce it to embers and walk straight through the ashes . "
92492	92529	92483	92483	He	1334	“ In the meantime , I have caused a summer encampment to be established in the mountains , Excellency . Perhaps you will join me there and we may come to know one another in comfort ? ”
92606	92609	92602	92602	he	1334	“ encampment . ”
92692	92706	92707	92707	Kitheri	295	“ More to a Mala Njeri soldier 's taste , I dare say , ”
92750	92755	92726	92726	Kitheri	295	“ Have you eaten ? "
92819	92827	92828	92828	Kitheri	295	" You are kind to say so , ”
92838	92875	92828	92828	Kitheri	295	“ I am pleased you have enjoyed it . The result of a new pastime . Or rather , the revival of an old skill . I have established a hunting reserve here in the hills . ”
92876	92884	92887	92889	the other guests	5288	“ The meat is wild - caught , ”
92892	92900	92887	92889	the other guests	5288	" Good exercise and excellent eating afterward . "
92901	92912	92913	92913	Kitheri	295	“ Perhaps the ambassador will join us in the morning ? "
92934	92947	92887	92889	the other guests	5288	“ I hope you shall not be shocked by our customs here — ”
92953	92961	92964	92966	the younger men	6944	" We stalk naked as the Heroes , "
92971	92980	92981	92981	Kitheri	295	“ My young friend has a poetic nature , ”
93009	93022	92999	93000	Ambassador Vaadai	554	“ As naked as our prey , a practical man might say . ”
93023	93033	93034	93036	an older man	2720	“ This herd is aware of us , naturally , "
93039	93052	93034	93036	an older man	2720	“ but my lord Kitheri hopes to backbreed to more naive stock . ”
93053	93062	93063	93063	Kitheri	295	“ To recapture the experiences of our forefathers , ”
93066	93098	93063	93063	Kitheri	295	“ One day , the best of our sons will come here to bring to life their heritage , so that they may earn the old strengths in the old ways . ”
93135	93173	93174	93174	he	295	“ The game program would involve utility Runa only . Specialists , I believe , we have bred to a point of intellectual maturity that will allow emancipation soon . But perhaps the Mala Njeri ambassador disagrees ? "
93187	93192	93193	93196	one of the others	2723	“ Fascinating legal problems , "
94593	94600	94601	94601	they	2798	“ He sings now to architecture ! "
94733	94745	94730	94730	he	295	“ And what does my lady Suukmel hear as she listens ? ”
94746	94749	94730	94730	he	295	" Sohraa , ”
94762	94769	94777	94777	HE	295	" Sohraa , sohraa , sohraa . "
95139	95157	95158	95158	Taksayu	549	“ My lady Suukmel wishes this most humble one to speak plainly to the most noble Paramount , ”
95184	95202	95204	95204	her	549	“ My lady Suukmel asks the Paramount : Am I a child to be corrupted by gifts ? "
95223	95230	95231	95231	Suukmel	545	“ He will not kill you , ”
95236	95255	95231	95231	Suukmel	545	“ He wants what he can not take — what must be given freely or not at all . ”
95336	95404	95405	95405	She	549	“ My lady asks : What might a man accomplish whose allies were his by force of love and loyalty ? Far more , my lady believes , than men alone in the world , whose fathers are obstacles and brothers are rivals , whose sons only yearn for their deaths ; whose sisters and daughters are used to bind subordinates or buy rank or placate enemies . ”
95408	95417	95405	95405	She	549	“ My lady asks : Shall I continue ? "
95431	95592	95593	95593	He	2829	“ Thus my lady Suukmel counsels the Paramount : First , may he take wisdom and skill from anyone of intelligence and talent , but especially from those ill matched to the station of their ancestors , for in these persons , the CHILDREN OF GOD 203 a Paramount may inspire such loyalty as my lady Suukmel freely gives to her good husband , who has afforded her as much liberty as could be desired by a woman of honor . Further , she counsels : May the Paramount revive a custom of the earliest Paramounts of Inbrokar , old as the oldest songs , and take to himself a harem of third - born women to bear him children to be neutered and raised without inheritance . Their status would not distress the future children of his infant VaPalkirn bride , thus preserving the advantages of that alliance with the east . My lady asks : Shall I continue ? ”
95604	95608	95593	95593	He	2829	“ Go on . "
95609	95716	95721	95722	the Paramount	1334	“ If it pleases the Paramount , my lady Suukmel says : The freeborn children of the harem might one day dance in daylight and glory in the suns , furthering their father 's desire for change better than even he can imagine . My lady says : May the Paramount consider who among his children might be taught to sing new songs . Send that child to the lady Suukmel for fostering , for in this she would be your partner , and such a child may be a bridge between what is and what can be . My lady asks : Shall I continue ? ”
95717	95720	95721	95722	the Paramount	1334	" Yes , "
95857	95869	95870	95871	Hlavin Kitheri	295	“ Tell your lady that she is everything rumor whispers of , "
95880	95885	95886	95886	He	295	“ Tell her that ... "
95894	95906	95886	95886	He	295	“ Tell her ... that I am grateful for her counsel . ”
95915	95928	95929	95930	JOSEBA Urizarbarrena	395	“ WANTED TO BE A TERRORIST WHEN I WAS A LITTLE BOY , ”
95933	95957	95929	95930	JOSEBA Urizarbarrena	395	“ It was a family tradition — both my grandmothers were ETA . We called ourselves freedom fighters , of course . Better ? "
95958	95961	95962	95962	Sandoz	263	“ Yes , ”
95965	95974	95962	95962	Sandoz	263	“ Good . Let me try the other . "
95993	96000	96001	96001	Joseba	395	“ This does n't always work , ”
96027	96060	96061	96061	Sandoz	263	“ My uncle lost most of his right hand when I was about eight . Do you know what they call it when a bomb goes off too soon ? Premature disassembly . ”
96086	96102	96103	96103	Joseba	395	“ My aunt used to think he was lying about the pain to get sympathy , "
96110	96157	96103	96103	Joseba	395	“ Dead dogs do n't bite , she used to say . The hand 's not there anymore . How can something that 's not there hurt ? My uncle used to tell her , Pain is as real as God . Invisible , unmeasurable , powerful "
96158	96166	96167	96167	Sandoz	263	“ And a bitch to live with , ”
96173	96179	96167	96167	Sandoz	263	“ Just like your aunt . ”
96180	96187	96188	96188	Joseba	395	" You 're right about that , ”
96259	96264	96247	96247	Sandoz	263	“ What 's wrong ? "
96329	96332	96333	96333	Joseba	395	“ Yes ? "
96400	96404	96393	96393	He	263	“ Thank you . ”
96423	96432	96409	96409	he	263	“ I do n't know why that works , ”
96436	96451	96452	96452	Sandoz	263	“ Maybe direct pressure on the nerves higher in the limb disrupts stray signals ? "
96462	96465	96455	96455	his	263	“ Maybe . ”
96485	96500	96501	96501	he	263	“ If you 'd told me about this before , I could have helped , ”
96504	96518	96519	96519	Sandoz	263	“ How was I to know you had inept bombers in your family ? "
96528	96541	96542	96542	Joseba	395	“ My uncle used to cry . Just sit there and cry , ”
96545	96549	96542	96542	Joseba	395	“ You pace . ”
96550	96553	96554	96554	Sandoz	263	" Sometimes . ”
96560	96567	96554	96554	Sandoz	263	“ Work used to be best . ”
96568	96575	96576	96576	Joseba	395	" You do n't work now , ”
96579	96588	96589	96589	Sandoz	263	“ Ca n't seem to care about working , ”
96592	96612	96589	96589	Sandoz	263	“ The Quell usually helps — about half of pain is fear . But it got bad this time . "
96626	96634	96635	96635	he	395	“ Has it ever occurred to you , ”
96648	96673	96640	96640	he	395	“ that Matins was instituted by old monks with prostate trouble ? Had to get up anyway , might as well pray , right ? "
96728	96770	96725	96725	he	395	“ I have been reading the Book of Job . ‘ Hast thou seen the doors of deepest darkness ? Canst thou bind the chains of the 206 Mary Doria Russell a a Pleiades , or loose the cords of Orion ? ”
96787	96847	96776	96777	the Basque	2837	“ Man 's answer now would be : Almost . We have entered the springs of the sea and walked the recesses of its depths . We have comprehended the expanse of the Earth and stretched a line upon it . ' Canst thou send lightnings ? Hast thou commanded the morning ? Here we are , between stars ! "
96860	96874	96857	96857	he	395	“ The music changed , you know . After you were on Rakhat . ”
96875	96885	96886	96886	Sandoz	263	“ I prefer Wolfer 's translation of Job myself , ”
96889	96901	96886	96886	Sandoz	263	“ So . Why did terrorism lose its charm for you ? "
96902	96910	96911	96911	Joseba	395	“ Ah . The subject is changed , ”
96915	96960	96961	96961	He	395	“ It did n't , not for a long time , anyway . Then Spain and France finally decided , To hell with the Basques — who needs them ? So we fought among ourselves for a while . Gets to be a habit . ”
96968	96993	96961	96961	He	395	“ Did you know Hlavin Kitheri 's voice was heard for less than a year after you left Rakhat , and then never again ? "
96994	96999	97000	97000	Sandoz	263	" Perhaps he died , ”
97004	97025	97000	97000	Sandoz	263	“ of something unpleasant and prolonged . What did you do after terrorism ceased to be a viable career option ? "
97026	97093	96961	96961	He	395	“ A lot of hunting , actually . We still hunt in the little corner of the world where I come from . I was outdoors all the time , surrounded by what 's left of nature in Europe . A hunter — a good one - often identifies very strongly with the prey . One thing led to another . I studied ecology at university . ”
97094	97118	96961	96961	He	395	“ And how from there to the priesthood ? You fell in love , perhaps , with God 's complex and beautiful creation ? ”
97156	97159	97160	97160	Joseba	395	“ No , ”
97164	97246	97160	97160	Joseba	395	“ It is difficult to see the complex beauty of creation these days , on Earth at least . Things got a lot worse while you were gone , my friend . Ecology has become a study of degradation . We a mainly work backward now , trying to reconstruct systems thrown out of balance and wrecked . For each step forward , we are forced two steps back by the press of population . It 's not a cheerful discipline . ”
97276	97464	97465	97465	Sandoz	263	" When you see a system disturbed , it is a great joy to discover a single cause — the cure then seems simple . As an undergraduate , I would look at satellite images of the planet at night , and the conCHILDREN OF GOD 207 nected concentrations of city lights looked to me like streptococcus taking over a petri dish . I became convinced that Homo sapiens was a disease that was ravaging its hostess , Gaia . The Earth would be well rid of us , I thought . I was nineteen , and the population had already gone from seven to fourteen billion in my lifetime . I began to hate this species that called itself wise . I wanted to cure Gaia of the sickness our species inflicted on her . I began to consider seriously how I might exterminate very large numbers of humans , preferably without being caught . I believed myself heroic and selfless — a solitary worker for the planetary good . I switched college majors at that time . Virology began to seem very useful to me . ”
97491	97496	97497	97497	Joseba	395	“ As I said , ”
97501	97576	97497	97497	Joseba	395	“ terrorism did not lose its charm . I was living with a girl at the time . I broke it off . She wanted children , and I loathed children . Disease vectors , I called them . I used to look at people like Nico and think , There 's a botched abortion . One more useless human to consume the planet , capable only of eating and making more of himself . ”
97611	97650	97606	97606	Sandoz	263	“ The last thing my girlfriend told me when we parted was that it was wicked to wish death on people whose only crime was to be born at a time when there are so many of us . ”
97683	97726	97651	97651	He	263	“ She opened my eyes , although we never spoke again . It took a while , but eventually I began to search for a reason to believe that humans are more than bacteria . One of my professors was a Jesuit . ”
97727	97753	97804	97804	Sandoz	263	“ And now you are going to a world where the sentient species do not degrade their environment . To see what it costs them ? "
97754	97763	97764	97764	Joseba	395	“ Penance for my sins , I suppose . ”
97787	97799	97800	97800	He	395	“ I think sometimes of the girl I did not marry . ”
97815	97895	97800	97800	He	395	“ I read somewhere an interesting suggestion . The nations of the world that most vigorously foul the planetary nest and those in possession of the most destructive arsenals ought to be governed only by young women with small kids .

You and I must offer Sandoz , bound like Abraham 's son Isaac . We must do what seems cruel and incomprehensible and , in doing so , prove that we trust in God 's plan and act as His instruments . We serve a Father Who did not flinch from Abraham 's sacrifice , Who required and permitted the crucifixion of His own Son !

105167	105228	105156	105156	he	295	” 222 Mary Doria Russell Soon , Kitheri established national competitions in poetry , architecture , engineering , mathematics , optics , chemistry . Having sworn during his investiture as Paramount to uphold the immutable Inbrokari order , he had to leave the ancient lines of inheritance untouched , and so prizes in such competitions were of no intrinsic value . “
105233	105238	105156	105156	he	295	” Suukmel said dismissively . “
105258	105310	105256	105256	himself	1334	” But it was not long before there were acceptable ways for warriors with a scholarly bent or third - born merchants of athletic talent to hone their knowledge or skills : to be recognized for what they had within , and not merely for what they had been born to . "
105318	105322	105256	105256	himself	1334	” Danny observed . "
105338	105352	105332	105332	Your	3028	" Not since Hlavin had she enjoyed a man 's company so well . “
105355	105364	105332	105332	Your	3028	” she said , eyes downcast but pleased . “
105383	105412	105370	105370	Kitheri	295	" Drawing on a lifetime of well - used confinement , Suukmel Chirot u Vaadai had learned that almost any event or condition could be turned to advantage . "
105439	105447	105448	105448	My	0	" she told Danny during another stroll . “
105501	105506	105452	105454	third - born	6022	” she said dryly , “
105513	105524	105452	105454	third - born	6022	" Ears cocked forward , she invited him to comment . "
105531	105541	105452	105454	third - born	6022	” Danny asked . Suukmel did not deny it . “
105578	105584	105585	105586	Such men	6617	” He thought a moment . "
105607	105608	105599	105599	Their	3037	" “
105611	105645	105599	105599	Their	3037	” She had become very frank with him as their time together lengthened . Danny was a wily listener , who appreciated careful phrasing , and his admiration perfumed her hours with him . “
105657	105661	105646	105646	We	3040	” she said . “
105705	105712	105646	105646	We	3040	” Suukmel said with limpid innocence , "
105717	105758	105802	105803	the Paramount	1334	” Nephews or brothers - in - law or third - born uncles could be placed in regency while revenue ledgers and tax records were confiscated for inspection by merchant thirds and Runa bookkeepers from a far - removed province . “
105775	105779	105802	105803	the Paramount	1334	” Suukmel recalled . “
105799	105800	105802	105803	the Paramount	1334	" “
105816	105820	105802	105803	the Paramount	1334	” Danny said . "
105838	105842	105802	105803	the Paramount	1334	" Suukmel said . “
105882	105883	105865	105866	Displaced regents	3048	” “
105900	105904	105865	105866	Displaced regents	3048	" Danny observed . “
105907	105916	105865	105866	Displaced regents	3048	” Danny looked at her with sly delight . “
105934	105935	105924	105925	my lady	1460	" “
105950	105967	105943	105948	a person of some modest influence	3053	” Suukmel murmured , and remained carefully composed even while he laughed and shook his head . “
105977	105981	105943	105948	a person of some modest influence	3053	” Suukmel continued , “
106036	106037	106020	106021	the Paramount	1334	” “
106044	106048	106020	106021	the Paramount	1334	” said Danny . “
106063	106064	106020	106021	the Paramount	1334	” “
106071	106076	106020	106021	the Paramount	1334	” Suukmel said carefully , “
106100	106101	106094	106094	outlaws	3059	” "
106108	106109	106094	106094	outlaws	3059	" “
106132	106143	106116	106118	martial tournament champions	3060	” She looked across 224 Mary Doria Russell the valley . “
106153	106157	106158	106159	My lord	1616	” she said . “
106186	106187	106176	106176	they	3063	” “
106200	106210	106176	106176	they	3063	” Suukmel 's chin lifted , acknowledging the inference . "
106217	106226	106176	106176	they	3063	” said Danny , but left that untranslated . "
106232	106240	106227	106227	YOU	3066	” SUUKMEL WARNED DANNY ON ANOTHER DAY , "
106311	106371	106301	106301	he	295	” At Suukmel 's suggestion and under the direction of her former maid , the discreetly emancipated Taksayu , a tapestry of Runa informants was woven during Kitheri 's first years as Paramount . Reports soon filtered back from cooks and valets , secretaries and masseurs ; from groundskeepers , research assistants ; from scullery maids and sexual servants . “
106375	106379	106301	106301	he	295	” Suukmel said , “
106399	106400	106382	106382	Kitheri	295	” “
106406	106419	106382	106382	Kitheri	295	” Danny interjected . Suukmel chuckled , a low and throaty sound . "
106427	106431	106382	106382	Kitheri	295	” she granted . “
106446	106447	106382	106382	Kitheri	295	" “
106494	106507	106490	106490	Taksayu	549	" she told him , pausing a moment to mourn the dead . “
106539	106540	106524	106524	He	295	" “
106554	106573	106524	106524	He	295	" Danny pointed out coldly . Not catching his tone , Suukmel went on , anxious to explain . “
106606	106618	106619	106619	she	7293	" object to an old retainer living off the Kitheri largesse ? "
106623	106645	106619	106619	she	7293	“ Meat , after all , could be had from villagers backbred to doorkeepers and fan - pullers and draft Runa — ”
106655	106664	106665	106665	she	7293	“ It was the only way we knew , ”
106673	106782	106665	106665	she	7293	“ Dani , you must understand it was not only the Runa who were born to their fatewe all were ! Birth rank , the rank of one 's family — even for a man , those determined every detail of life ! The length of his claws , which door he was permitted to pass through . Whom he could marry , what his work would be . The number of earrings he could wear , the grade of perfumes he could buy ! And yes — what portion of a Runa carcass his meat would come from . Dani , Hlavin meant to change all that ! ”
106783	106789	106790	106790	Danny	589	“ But change takes time , ”
106793	106797	106790	106790	Danny	589	“ Another proverb . ”
106812	106829	106800	106800	her	545	“ I think perhaps that it is not change but resistance to change that takes time . ”
106830	106853	106854	106854	Danny	589	“ But surely , my lady , the Paramount did not pension those elderly Runa purely to reward their usefulness with kindness , ”
106867	106896	106862	106862	he	3083	“ The accumulated knowledge of Runa from all over Inbrokar was made directly available to Kitheri 's chancery , to Kitheri 's private police and to Kitheri himself . ”
106897	106913	106914	106914	she	545	" Yes ! Of course ! Can you build a wall with a single stone ? "
106917	106949	106914	106914	she	545	“ The sign of a good decision is the multiplicity of reasons for it . If more than one goal is served , then a decision is more likely to be wise "
106989	107066	106968	106968	he	3083	“ Dani , when we change things , we are like the little gods : we act , and from each act falls a cascade of consequence — some things expected and desired , some surprising and regrettable . But we are not like your God who sees everything ! We can not know the future , so we anticipate as much as we can , and judge by the outcome if we have done rightly . "
107085	107093	107094	107094	she	545	“ Dani , have I offended you ? "
107108	107114	107099	107099	He	3083	“ My lady : never ! ”
107127	107136	107137	107137	he	3083	“ You are the instrument of my conscience , ”
107175	107256	107170	107170	he	3083	“ My lady , it was once my belief that when a multiplicity of reasons is sought , the rightness of an act a 226 Mary Doria Russell is suspect , that one is trying to justify the unjustifiable . Long ago , I made a decision for which I sought a multitude of reasons . That decision brought me here to you , but I will not know if it was right until I am judged by my God . ”
107312	107315	107316	107316	she	545	“ Look , ”
107332	107336	107337	107337	she	545	“ And listen , ”
107352	107358	107359	107359	He	3083	“ How can you doubt ? ”
107395	107408	107409	107409	Danny	589	" WHAT YOU HAVE TOLD ME EXPLAINS POLITICAL POWER , MY LADY , ”
107415	107462	107409	107409	Danny	589	“ but there was more to Kitheri than that , I think . Men followed him , but not for a single traja'anron blossom or a pennant or a rhyming triplet . And not , I think , for wealth or power or even breeding rights . "
107463	107476	107477	107477	Suukmel	545	“ They followed him out of love , and out of loyalty , ”
107481	107514	107477	107477	Suukmel	545	" Hlavin Kitheri began to seem the embodiment of their own greatness . They loved him for what he and they had become , and they would have done anything for him . ”
107515	107545	107546	107546	He	3090	“ So when the Paramount let it be known that he desired that such men should be bound closer to him , they forgot or forgave Kitheri 's reputation for- ”
107554	107561	107562	107562	she	545	“ Sexual ... sophistication , perhaps ? "
107570	107588	107562	107562	she	545	“ Yes . These men willingly gave their third - born sisters or daughters to his harem . "
107589	107607	107477	107477	Suukmel	545	“ Even knowing that the children of those matings would have no appointed place in the hierarchy ? "
107608	107682	107683	107683	she	545	“ Yes , knowing that the lives of those born to Kitheri 's house would not be decreed by birth or governed by death . So be it , such men said . Let the future carve out its course , like a river in flood . Neither did they falter at Hlavin 's lifting of the breeding bans on certain merchant thirds . Can you understand how ' revolutionary ' this was ? "
107691	107802	107683	107683	she	545	“ We had always been careful stewards of our inheritance . Our honor CHILDREN OF GOD 227 was to pass down , undegraded , whatever legacy we ourselves had received . To bequeath more was dishonor : this implied theft . To bequeath less was dishonor : this implied profligacy . But Hlavin showed us all that there could be creation ! Something , out of nothing ! Poetry , wealth , music , ideas , dance : out of nothing ! Stewardship could encompass increase ! Everyone began to see this , and we all wondered — even I wondered what had we been frightened of all these years ? "
108297	108310	108311	108313	Daniel Iron Horse	385	" WHEN DID YOU FIRST REALIZE WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE SOUTH ? ”
108323	108333	108334	108334	Suukmel	545	“ Almost from the beginning , there were signs , ”
108337	108361	108334	108334	Suukmel	545	“ Less than a season after Hlavin acceded to the paramountcy , the first of the refugees appeared at the gates of Inbrokar . ”
108409	108441	108395	108407	these few Jana'ata had earned , and whose warnings these few had heeded	3133	“ My lord Kitheri appreciated the irony , Dani . He himself once said , ' I fathered the destruction of the new world at the moment of its conception . ' ”
108442	108457	108458	108458	Danny	589	“ There are limits , of course , to anyone 's breadth of view , ”
108489	108508	108509	108509	Danny	589	“ It seems to me , my lady , that if things had been only a little different – ”
108512	108530	108509	108509	Danny	589	“ Perhaps Supaari VaGayjur might have become the first and most useful of Kitheri 's supporters . ' "
108533	108541	108509	108509	Danny	589	” Suukmel said after a long time . “
108566	108572	108573	108574	The merchant	1338	” She paused , thinking . “
108596	108618	108586	108586	he	3138	" Chest tight , she looked at Danny , who was her equal in height , and in many other things . “
108621	108626	108586	108586	he	3138	” she said steadily , “
108645	108646	108709	108709	Supaari	286	" ”
108657	108674	108675	108676	Djalao VaKashan	306	“ SOMEONE HAS ASSEMBLED THE TRADE GOODS YOU SPECIFIED . THEY'RE cached near the lander site , ”
108695	108704	108690	108690	She	306	“ There are djanada patrols everywhere out there . "
108705	108708	108709	108709	Supaari	286	“ Cullers ? "
108713	108728	108709	108709	Supaari	286	“ Or inspection teams , perhaps , just taking census for the new paramountcy ? "
108729	108734	108735	108735	Djalao	306	“ Someone thinks neither , ”
108755	108806	108735	108735	Djalao	306	“ At Kirabai , the people say these are men from the north , from Inbrokar City . They have foreign Runa with them — from Mala Njer , someone thinks . The elders at Kirabai had to call on interpreters whose lineages are very old , to understand them . ”
108833	108841	108842	108842	she	306	“ The patrols ask always about Supaari , ”
108847	108854	108842	108842	she	306	“ They ask also about foreigners . "
108855	108864	108865	108865	Sofia	356	" Is it safe for us to travel ? ”
108871	108888	108865	108865	Sofia	356	" Perhaps we - but - not - you must wait until this trouble is over . ”
108889	108919	108920	108920	Djalao	306	“ Someone thinks , we - and - you - also can travel , but in redlight only . It might be best for you to go without delay . ”
108929	108942	108920	108920	Djalao	306	“ Lord , will you permit one of us to lead you ? "
108978	108984	108985	108985	he	286	“ Am I a lord , ”
108988	108995	108985	108985	he	286	“ who can permit or forbid ? ”
109024	109027	109028	109028	he	286	“ Apologies , ”
109032	109041	109028	109028	he	286	“ Someone will be grateful for your guidance . ”
109322	109327	109328	109328	he	363	“ Isaac hears you , ”
109340	109344	109328	109328	he	363	" Ha'anala fell . ”
109601	109608	109609	109609	Supaari	286	“ Tomorrow , at second dawn , ”
109618	109666	109667	109667	Sofia	356	“ We 'll stay in the forest as long as possible — it 's a little farther to walk , but it will be safer than taking the shortest route across the savannah . When we have to cross open country , we 'll travel at night . ”
109694	109704	109705	109705	Supaari	286	" Shall you be sad to leave , Fia ? ”
109731	109743	109744	109744	she	356	“ They have been so kind — so good to us , ”
109764	109775	109744	109744	she	356	“ If only there were some way to repay them ... "
109776	109779	109780	109780	Supaari	286	“ Yes , ”
109783	109814	109780	109780	Supaari	286	“ But I think the best course is to leave . The patrols are looking for us , Sofia . We can only be a danger to the Runa now . ”
110048	110054	110055	110055	Djalao	306	“ We 'll wait here , ”
110189	110197	110154	110154	she	356	“ Stinks like a pack of benhunjaran , ”
110228	110254	110225	110225	he	286	“ Even if a Jana'ata patrol catches the scent during redlight , they 'll move upwind and as far away as possible the next morning . ”
110265	110281	110255	110255	He	286	" Someone wonders , how long have the people been getting away with this trick ? "
110310	110322	110307	110307	she	356	“ The djanada are like ghosts . They can be fooled . ”
110599	110608	110590	110590	Supaari	286	" What has happened ? What is it ? "
110800	110804	110805	110805	SOFIA	356	“ All right , ”
110815	110916	110805	110805	SOFIA	356	“ We are going to leave the children here for now . You and Sichu - Lan and Tinbar can stay with them . Kanchay , Djalao and I will go on alone to the lander . I 've checked the fuel levels and I can make a flight back here to collect you and the children and the trade goods without risking the return to the mother ship . We can carry Isaac into the plane while he 's asleep . By the time he wakes up , we 'll be on board the Magellan . Do you understand ? ”
110917	110924	110964	110964	Djalao	306	" I 'm coming with you . "
110925	110942	110805	110805	SOFIA	356	“ Oh , God , Supaari , we argued all night . It 's been decided — ”
110943	110950	110951	110951	he	3192	“ I 'm coming with you , ”
110983	110993	110994	110994	Sofia	356	“ Sipaj , Supaari . You are a hazard , "
110999	111005	110994	110994	Sofia	356	“ You will slow us down ”
111006	111038	111052	111052	Djalao	306	“ We will travel in full daylight . We can make the journey in half the time that way , and we wo n't have to do it reeking of benhunjaran — "
111039	111048	111049	111049	She	356	“ Sipaj , Supaari , are you mad ? ”
111059	111070	111049	111049	She	356	“ If a patrol sees us — 234 Mary Doria Russell “
111082	111094	111095	111095	Someone	1080	” Supaari reminded her in English . He turned to Djalao . “
111106	111107	111095	111095	Someone	1080	” “
111127	111136	111122	111122	They	3200	” Djalao said , her bloodshot eyes calm . “
111152	111153	111154	111154	Supaari	286	” "
111156	111164	111154	111154	Supaari	286	" Sofia gasped , but Djalao said , “
111169	111180	111154	111154	Supaari	286	” without waiting for the others to express an opinion . “
111193	111290	111291	111291	Supaari	286	” THE PLAINS WERE EMPTY , AND FOR A TIME IT APPEARED THAT THE worry and precautions were unjustified . For two days , they seemed to be the highest things on the horizon . No one challenged or greeted them , and Supaari should have been reassured , but he was n't . There 's something wrong with the sky , he thought , lowering his backbasket and sitting on the ground while the Runa foraged . The light was subtly dimmed in a way he could n't define . A volcano ? he wondered . “
111293	111338	111291	111291	Supaari	286	" He turned and saw Sofia , who was gnawing on a betrin root . She looked so brown ! Was there something wrong with his eyes or had she changed color ? Unsure of his own perceptions , Supaari gestured toward the sky . “
111346	111353	111291	111291	Supaari	286	” he asked . She frowned . “
111373	111394	111395	111395	I	0	” she said . Almost five years in a forest , she thought , remembering sunlight shattered by shifting leaves . “
111410	111411	111412	111412	Sipaj	311	” “
111416	111431	111414	111414	Djalao	306	” Supaari called softly . She straightened from the melfruit bush she was stripping . “
111440	111444	111445	111445	You	306	” Sofia snorted . “
111450	111469	111448	111448	Isaac	363	” she told Supaari as Djalao walked over , but sobered when she saw the Runao 's face . “
111475	111532	111448	111448	Isaac	363	” Djalao agreed uneasily . Supaari stood and faced into the wind , clearing his lungs through his mouth , then inhaled a long breath through his nostrils ; the breeze was too stiff for a coherent plume , but he hoped at least to snatch a hint from the air . Djalao watched him intently . “
111536	111541	111448	111448	Isaac	363	” he told her . “
111546	111547	111448	111448	Isaac	363	" “
111552	111576	111448	111448	Isaac	363	” Djalao whispered , not wanting to alarm Kanchay , who was ambling over with an armload of trijat leaf . Sofia asked , “
111581	111587	111448	111448	Isaac	363	" a CHILDREN OF GOD 235 "
111590	111617	111448	111448	Isaac	363	” said Djalao , glancing significantly at Kanchay , who 'd had enough to cope with the past few days . But Supaari told Sofia quietly , “
111625	111626	111448	111448	Isaac	363	" "
111704	111711	111712	111712	Kanchay	307	“ Kashan will be all right , ”
111722	111733	111712	111712	Kanchay	307	“ The djanada burned our garden a long time ago . ”
111955	111968	111969	111969	she	356	“ They must have hit every village that ever had a garden , ”
111988	111996	111997	111997	Kanchay	307	“ But there are no more gardens , ”
112008	112016	111997	111997	Kanchay	307	“ We never planted food again . ' “
112025	112034	111997	111997	Kanchay	307	” Sofia said , looking up at Supaari . “
112037	112038	111997	111997	Kanchay	307	" “
112043	112047	111997	111997	Kanchay	307	” he whispered . “

112074	112080	112054	112056	All those people	3218	" Kanchay asked , dazed . “
112093	112094	112095	112097	The new Paramount	3220	" “
112104	112116	112117	112118	The lords	1578	” Djalao explained , her voice as empty as Sofia 's . “
112147	112148	112150	112150	he	3220	" “
112159	112163	112150	112150	he	3220	" Kanchay cried . “
112170	112180	112150	112150	he	3220	" Kanchay turned and looked at Sofia and Djalao . “
112187	112211	112150	112150	he	3220	” he asked , and when no one responded , Kanchay took three long steps toward Supaari , and shoved the Jana'ata hard . “
112218	112222	112223	112223	Kanchay	307	" he demanded . “
112225	112236	112223	112223	Kanchay	307	" Sofia cried , startled out of her own numbness . “
112243	112268	112223	112223	Kanchay	307	” Kanchay shouted , but before the Jana'ata could stammer an answer , the Runao 's anger erupted like molten rock and he was roaring now—“What
112272	112338	112339	112339	Kanchay	307	right?"-over and over , each - — word punctuated with a blow and a burst of blood from the face of a man who staggered back but did nothing to counter the attack . Her face white with terror , Sofia scrambled up and threw her arms around Kanchay . He flung her off like a rag doll , not even pausing in his assault . “
112341	112365	112339	112339	Kanchay	307	" Sofia screamed , astonished , and tried again to push between the two men , only to be knocked away once more . “
112368	112382	112366	112366	Djalao	306	" she shouted from the ground , her own face spattered with gore . “
112393	113349	112386	112386	He	307	” For an eternity , Djalao stood gaping , too stunned to move . Then finally , she dragged Kanchay off the bleeding Jana'ata . Shocked senseless , all of them stood or knelt or lay where they were , until the sound of Kanchay 's gasping grief subsided . It was only then that Supaari got to his feet , and spat blood , and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand . He wheeled slowly , looking all around him , as though searching for something he would never find again ; leaned back against his tail , winded and lost . Then , without a word , he walked away from the ruins of Kashan , empty - handed and empty - souled . THE OTHERS FOLLOWED . HE DIDN'T CARE . HE DID NOT EAT ; COULD NOT , in truth . Regret sickened him as much as the cloying smoke of burnt meat that remained in his fur despite two drenching rains on the journey back to the forest . Not even the scent of his infant daughter could drive off the CHILDREN OF GOD 237 stink of death ; when they were reunited at the woodland 's edge , he refused to hold Ha'anala . He did not want to contaminate his child with what her people — what his peopleWhat he had done . When at last they arrived at Trucha Sai , he was too far gone in guilt to hear what anyone said . He sat at the edge of the clearing , allowing no one to touch him , not even to scrub the stink from his coat . What gives us the right ? he asked himself when the sky 's darkness matched his heart 's . What gives us the right ? He did not sleep that first night back among the Runa ; when dawn lightened the sky enough for him to see , he left before they roused . No Runao could track him , and he believed that death would find him in the forest if he simply waited long enough . For uncounted days in a black absence of thought , he wandered aimlessly while it was light , lay down wherever he was when fatigue and hunger overcame him . On that last night , with his gut cramped against its hollowness , he sank blindly to the ground near a recently abandoned tinper nest . It was crawling with vicious little khimali and , while he slept , they burrowed through his fur and fastened onto his skin , making a meal of his blood . He awoke once in the middle of the night to physical misery , bleeding from thousands of small wounds , but did not move or try to pick the parasites from his body . Close now , he thought with vague relief . He did not so much fall asleep as lose consciousness . It rained that night . He did n't hear the thunder . It was full morning when the bright golden glare of the middle sun found his face through a small space in the shifting leaves . Sodden , curled on the forest floor , he opened his eyes without lifting his head and dully watched the khimali at close range as they trundled through the miniature forest of fine fur that covered his wrist . They do n't take enough to kill their host , Supaari thought , sorry to have lived through the night , and disgusted by the jointed carapaces , the scuttling gait of the bloated little beasts . They suck blood and give back nothing . That is the way of parasites . They . ... He sat up , and blinkedHe was dizzy and near starvation , but his mind felt at that moment perfectly translucent . The sensation , he would tell Sofia later , was not serenity — although he knew even then that serenity would be his reward , when his part in the plan was fulfilled . What he felt was joy . It seemed to him that perfection was revealed all around him , that he and the forest and the khimali were all one thing , all part of a strange brilliance . Sunlight shafted 238 Mary Doria Russell the small clearing , and this too seemed a revelation . His own confusion and wretchedness had parted , like clouds , and allowed this ... illumination to penetrate . He could envision everything before him : the steps he would take , the path he would travel , the end . He had only to see it through . Everything was clear to him now . This joy lasted only a little while , but he knew he would never be the same . When it passed , he staggered to his feet , unaware of his own lightheadedness . A strong odor caught his attention ; something had died that morning somewhere in the understory . Without thinking , he crouched and spun slowly , tail sweeping low through the vegetation , arms flung outward for balance , sampling the air until he located the source of the scent : a good - sized bush wa'ile , wasted with age . Supaari ate it raw , ripping its belly open with his teeth and claws . Better a scavenger , he thought , than a parasite . He knew , even then , that he would eat Runa again . The difference was that he meant now to transform their sacrifice . He would return it to them : life for life . “
113356	113373	113353	113354	SU PAARI	598	" THE RUNA CRIED WHEN THEY FIRST SAW HIM STANDing at the edge of the settlement . “
113380	113381	113353	113354	SU PAARI	598	” “
113390	113425	113426	113426	Someone	1080	” he said , and he held out his arms to display the sores in his armpits , the blotched red stains that spoiled his coat . Sofia approached despite his warning and said , “
113435	113436	113431	113431	Someone	1080	" "
113440	113504	113431	113431	Someone	1080	" he said . Her offer touched him to his heart , but he could not permit this , not yet . Looking past Sofia toward the Runa , he gazed at the village , neat , well cared for and well run ; gazed at the Runa themselves , who had lived in Trucha Sai for years without Jana'ata interference or exploitation . “
113510	113552	113431	113431	Someone	1080	” he asked them loudly . There was a mutter of response and a tendril of their anxiety began to reach him . He was worrying them and he regretted that . But it was necessary — this confusion before clarity . “
113557	113562	113563	113563	Khimali	599	” he asked again . “
113565	113621	113622	113622	They	3231	” Djalao said shortly , coming forward , standing next to Sofia . She wanted to stop this odd behavior , he knew . Wanted to draw Supaari away to a place where she could pick through his coat , wanted to crush the revolting little creatures between her fingers and be done with this . “
113631	113635	113636	113636	They	3231	” she snapped . “
113647	113652	113656	113656	khimali	599	" But Supaari called , “
113658	113659	113660	113660	Parasites	7557	" “
113662	113673	113660	113660	Parasites	7557	” Djalao answered , exasperated , staring at him now . “
113683	113684	113680	113680	you	286	" “
113690	113702	113688	113688	parasites	7557	” he asked , still looking past her to the others , "
113730	113763	113688	113688	parasites	7557	" Most of the Runa looked around uncertainly , shifting from foot to foot . But Djalao straightened , and met his eyes . She knows , he thought . She understands . “
113767	113773	113781	113781	parasites	7557	” he asked her softly , “
113783	113784	113781	113781	parasites	7557	" “
113788	113797	113781	113781	parasites	7557	” she said as softly and as certainly . “

113866	113878	113879	113879	Emilio	261	" No , I 'm not certain that you are serious , ”
113948	113962	113926	113927	John Candotti	378	" You want some of this ? I could make enough for two . ”
113963	113982	113926	113927	John Candotti	378	" No ! Listen to me ! The longer we wait , the farther we are from home _ ”
113983	114001	113926	113927	John Candotti	378	“ So what are you going to do ? Cut Carlo 's throat while he 's asleep ? "

114010	114020	114006	114006	John	378	“ But we could lock him in his cabin — "
114021	114026	114027	114027	Emilio	261	" Oh , please ! "
114039	114048	114034	114034	he	261	" Get me some juice , will you ? ”
114049	114064	114006	114006	John	378	" Emilio , he 's only one man ! There are seven of us — ”
114065	114080	114081	114081	he	261	" Have you talked to any of the others about this , Mistah Christian ? "
114123	114134	114100	114100	He	378	“ I came to you first , but I 'm sure ”
114138	114143	114144	114144	Emilio	261	“ Do n't be , ”
114183	114199	114161	114161	he	261	“ The count is seven to one , but you 're the one , John . ”
114262	114270	114271	114271	he	261	“ Look . John . Face facts , ”
114275	114301	114302	114302	He	261	“ No matter what you think of him or his motives , Danny Iron Horse has already staked his soul on this mission , yes ? "
114314	114366	114310	114310	John	378	“ Joseba has his own reasons for wanting to go on to Rakhat , regardless of anyone else 's . Sean — I do n't understand Sean , but he seems to think that cynicism about human nature is an adequate response to sin . He wo n't take a stand . ”
114382	114387	114388	114388	Emilio	261	“ As for Nico , ”
114391	114446	114447	114447	Emilio	261	“ do n't underestimate him . He is not as dim as he looks , and he has been thoroughly inculcated with the notion of loyalty to his padrone . Attack Carlo , and you will have Nico to deal with , and I warn you : he is very good at his job . ”
114450	114491	114447	114447	Emilio	261	“ But let 's say Sean stood out of this , and you could co - opt Danny and Joseba , and overcome Carlo and Nico somehow . You 'd still need Fat Frans to pilot the ship back to Earth "
114492	114517	114590	114590	Emilio	261	“ Right , and Frans is a shameless mercenary ! So we buy him off ! And anyway , he thinks Carlo is crazy — "
114518	114528	114529	114529	Emilio	261	“ Frans has a wonderful gift for colorful exaggeration . "

114633	114641	114642	114642	Carlo	284	“ Positively Machiavellian . Really , Candotti , ”
114655	114683	114684	114684	He	284	“ secrecy is the first principle of cona 242 Mary Doria Russell » spiracy ! The commons room is hardly the place for this sort of thing . "

114723	114747	114748	114748	John	378	“ What I wish is irrelevant . The fact is , I was a part of their lives for only a few months . ”
114757	114798	114752	114752	Emilio	261	“ Years are passing at home , John . Even if we were to come about and return now , I could hardly expect to drop back in on them as though I 'd been away on a business trip . "
114807	114822	114804	114804	Carlo	284	“ I may assume then that you have reached a decision regarding my proposals — ”
115057	115067	115068	115068	Carlo	284	“ That 's the axis ... in the tube ! ”
115153	115180	115181	115181	Carlo	284	“ Sandoz , there is a ... red control button ... to your left—. Yes . Be so kind ... as to press that , please ? "
115266	115270	115271	115271	Carlo	284	" Well done , ”

115518	115580	115506	115506	he	284	“ I believe ... the Giordano Bruno must have struck a micrometeorite . Since ... we have not been reduced to ... mineral dust and a haze of organic ... molecules , we may deduce that whatever we hit ... was very small . But we are ... moving very quickly , which accounts for ... the result of that impact . ”
115593	115601	115602	115602	Carlo	284	“ Ah ! You see , Sandoz ? "
115613	115648	115602	115602	Carlo	284	" the vacuum is sucking dirt from ... the Wolverton tube ... through the channel ... drilled by the particle . It has now been clogged with plant debris ... and sealed itself off . ”

115836	116081	115823	115823	he	284	“ Get ready to fall . If all goes well , the inertial guidance system will ... begin firing the attitude rockets soonThere were short , heartfelt prayers and curses — both consisting entirely of the name of Jesus — and more cries of fear , startlement and pain as the Al guidance system began firing its jets , which automatically registered their own effects on the stability of the ship and readjusted the Bruno 's pitch and roll and yaw with brief thrusts . In the commons , globules of orange juice formed up in momentary spells of weightlessness , and the carnival ride gave way to a nauseating kaleidoscope of scrambled eggs and dust , with Emilio 's fork spinning crazily near a floating plate . In the cabins , anything left loose - computer tablets , razors , socks , bedding , rosaries — danced with men 's bodies to the erratic forces of the ship 's motion , which changed instant by instant . Everywhere , boluses of spit and vomit and tears — briefly held together by surface tension — were now added to the mess , shattering as they splashed against surfaces or collided with some other object or were struck by the frantic movement of a man 's arms and legs seeking purchase . Within endless minutes , the spin stabilized and they were pulled back toward the ship 's periphery but now with far less force . “

116126	116134	116152	116153	Don Gianni	606	” Carlo said , cool as ever , "

116155	116166	116149	116149	you	284	” Nico asked helpfully , without a trace of irony . “

116184	116188	116152	116153	Don Gianni	606	” Carlo warned , “
116197	116244	116152	116153	Don Gianni	606	" Which meant full , normal gravity . Floors abruptly reestablished their claim on Down , and anyone who had not made it to the bottom of his wall while the guidance system slowed and stopped the spin acquired a few more bruises for his tardiness . “
116247	116275	116152	116153	Don Gianni	606	” Carlo cried cheerfully , picking himself up with the almost magCHILDREN OF GOD 245 ical self - satisfaction that handsome Italian males acquire in middle age . “

Frans , amply padded and phlegmatic , had come through without injury , and Nico 's inability to imagine how much danger they 'd just been in had served him well . Joseba was silent and breathing hard , but otherwise intact . Sean was visibly shaken , but Danny Iron Horse was focused and alert . Carlo himself knew exactly where each Newtonian law of motion had been demonstrated on his body , but was fully functional . John , too , insisted he was okay and was already at work ; having located a galley water pipe that had burst under torsion , he had cut off the main valve and was going through the plumbing supplies with Nico , looking for what he needed to fix it . Sandoz was calm , of course , saying only , “
116485	116532	116533	116533	I	0	” Apart from cuts and bruises , there were no injuries , perhaps because most of them had been in bed . Allowing no time for anyone to give way to post - traumatic panic , Carlo handed out assignments with a brisk , businesslike dispatch . “

116793	116832	116786	116787	Mary Doria	518	” It was only then that Joseba and Danny looked at the Wolverton tube in the center of the commons and stared , horrified , at the battered and torn plants that had been ripped from their moorings . “
116840	116844	116838	116838	gentlemen	5225	” Carlo insisted . “

117016	117028	117014	117014	Caesar	609	” Danny Iron Horse said to Carlo when they were alone . "
117034	117059	117014	117014	Caesar	609	” One hand raised , palm inward , the other laid gracefully upon his chest , Carlo struck a pose implying an invisible toga . “

117196	117237	117176	117176	we	3300	” Danny suggested as they walked toward the spiral stairs that led to their cabins below . Carlo laughed , but before he could go through the hatch , Iron Horse put out an imposing arm , blocking his way . “
117244	117253	117254	117254	I	0	” Danny asked curiously , black eyes steady . “
117266	117322	117261	117261	I	0	” Carlo said , but Danny would n't let him pass so Carlo took a step back and stood quietly , hands behind his beautiful back , classical head cocked , gray eyes speculative . His contemporaries found him surprisingly fastidious : Carlo Giuliani rarely used vulgarities unless the situation genuinely seemed to demand them . “
117327	117336	117261	117261	I	0	” he said very gently and very distinctly , “
117367	117649	117363	117363	Sandoz	261	” They looked at each other for a long time . Dropping his arm , Danny nodded and started down the stairs . а ENCASED IN PRESSURE SUITS FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER , DANNY AND Carlo met again in the passageway beyond their cabins and moved from room to room , surveying the damage . Carlo 's orders to keep every loose item stowed and secure had been fairly well complied with , even in private spaces , and this had undoubtedly decreased the severity of the injuries sustained . Mostly they saw a jumbled mess but ignored that , pushing bedding and clothing aside to inspect the walls , floors and ceilings of each room . The surfaces were coated with a stress - crackle polymer on which the effects of twisting were evident . It was most severe on the outer walls , but research and experience had shown that in - line collisions were the only survivable scenario , so Carlo had chosen an asteroid and configured it with that in mind . Cracks in the outer shell were still a possibility - it would take sonar soundings to discover those . But the life - supporting central cylinder of the Bruno , it seemed , was in no immediate danger of splitting apart . Passing through the commons on the way to the lander bay , Carlo noted that Nico was already done with the galley . Food and equipment had been kept tightly packed and locked in storage bins . Nothing but Sandoz 's frying pan had been left out . Satisfied , Carlo stopped at the bridge , where Frans and Sandoz were already running diagnostics . "
117657	117688	117689	117689	I	0	" Carlo said . His voice through the throat mike was thin and uninflected ; even so , it was clear that there had better be good reason for insubordination . “
117701	117722	117689	117689	I	0	” Frans said shortly . He grinned then at Danny Iron Horse , impassive behind his suit 's face shield . “

117765	117770	117739	117739	you	3307	” Danny said dryly . “
117778	117783	117784	117784	We	3306	” Carlo asked Frans . “
117791	117799	117784	117784	We	3306	” Frans informed him , serious again . “

117889	117895	117872	117872	Frans	533	” WROTE THE STOIC EPICTEtus , “
117912	118243	117872	117872	Frans	533	” Carlo Giuliani had read those words at the age of thirteen , a week after one of the many funerals he attended as a child . A cousin had been blown to bits by a car bomb ; there was nothing much to put in the coffin , but two hundred vehicles had followed the nearly empty box as the cortege wound its way through Naples . Carlo had not personally witnessed that particular demise , but he had been spattered with blood and gobbets of brain at the age of seven - an uncle that time — and so had contemplated mortality from an early age . Another boy might have gone into the priesthood ; certainly , there was ample precedent for that in the family — there was even a fourteenthcentury stigmatic surnamed Giuliani . But there were far too many martyrs in Christian hagiography to suit Carlo . With an adolescent 's romantic sense of self - importance , he focused not on Jesus Christ but on Marcus Aurelius . It took the greatest of the caesars , a hero of monumental selfcontrol and fearlessness , to shore up the fragile courage of a boy who would be fair game soon , should a rival famiglia need to target a low - risk victim for a revenge execution . Aurelius proved a difficult role model . Carlo strove for a Stoic 's rationality and courage , only to be dragged down into the strange Neapolitan mire of pre - Christian superstition and rococo Catholicism . He had grown up both cosseted and reviled , outrageously overindulged and viciously undermined . He remained in some ways his mother 's disastrously spoiled son , enraged by the slightest opposition ; like his father , he could be all but blind to the desires of others , except insofar as they meshed with his own . Nevertheless , he knew these characteristics to be flaws and fought them . “
118250	118255	117872	117872	Frans	533	” wrote Marcus Aurelius , “

This was no idle boast but the touchstone of his life , and the Giordano Bruno was proof that his struggles had not been without consequence . The ship was configured within a large , solid , unusually a а CHILDREN OF GOD 249 a 9 symmetrical rock - virgin mineral , with no prior mining to weaken its structure . Its interior cylinder was carefully assayed , sounded , and drilled out by mining robots . Top - of - the - line crew quarters were sealed into the center , well shielded from cosmic radiation . The entire outer surface of the asteroid was pressure - treated with resilient self - healing foam . All photonics , life - support and guidance systems were triply redundant , controlled by exhaustively tested artificial intelligences programmed to respond to any unscheduled interruption of function with automatic power - on sequences and stabilization procedures , even if the crew was incapacitated . It had cost a fortune . Carlo had made his arguments to his father in commercial terms and his sister Carmella had backed him up , of coursethe project would remove him as a potential rival while the bitch consolidated power . But , as his sister pointed out , money spent up front to increase the chances of a successful voyage would pay a satisfying return on a long - term financial investment . That this might also result in the return of Domenico Giuliani 's son was , that estranged son suspected , an acceptable risk , given that Domenico would not be around to deal with it personally . Rot in hell , old man , Carlo thought , his own breathing loud in his ears as he climbed through the central access core of the ship to find out precisely how close he had come to joining his father there , two hours earlier . There was a fine coating of black dust everywhere inside the ship 's forward utility bay , where the remote sensing equipment was housed . Following the fanlike spray of dirt to its origin in the floor , he brushed at a , miniature Vesuvius with a booted foot and then bent to clear the rest of the fine dust with his glove . He found a hole . Straightening , he stepped back and looked now to the ceiling , which was the ship 's bow when it was under power , and found the entry wound , also plugged with sieved soilmix sucked into the breach by the vacuum of space and held there by friction . He knew without looking that there would be identical exit holes at the other end of the ship . Trusting in physics for the time being , he left the plug alone and mentally charted the collision . A particle of matter — a speck of iron perhapsgot in their way and drilled a narrow column from bow to stern ... a It was not a good moment . If the drill hole had been a bit more offcenter , the spin would have been more violent and the ship would have gone to pieces ; even if it held together , its passengers might have been pulped . If the micrometeorite had been much larger , the ship would have been destroyed . If the collision had occurred at their maximum velocity , a 250 Mary Doria Russell an impact like this would have vaporized them before they knew anything had happened , and the Giordano Bruno would have joined the list of ships mysteriously lost en route to Rakhat . He almost giggled , giddy at last , when he heard himself thinking , A novena for the Virgin when I get home . ... No — a whole church , filled with treasures from Rakhat ! Rationality , he was finding , took a poor second to religion after a morning like this . He roused himself , and looked at the sensor box just to starboard of the drill hole . Careful not to disturb the dirt that stood between him and the void , Carlo pulled the box out of its housing and gently shook out a diaphanous shower of fine particles — it was fouled by soilmix . There were two more sensor packs stored below . He would replace this box , but decided to put Candotti to work reconditioning the one in his hands . We may yet need this one as a backup , Carlo thought . “

She hated this , and ended her transmissions to Earth , believing that to sever this last tie would end the dreams , but they continued . Most often , she was in an airport , waiting for her flight 's departure to be announced , or in some train terminal ; in these dreams , she believed that Jimmy was waiting for her somewhere . Sometimes she would be walking on a once - familiar city street in Tokyo or Warsaw . More often , she was in some chimerical dream - place that merely stood for Earth . She was nearly always alone in her dreams but , once , she was sitting in a coffee shop , listening to conversations around her , when Sandoz walked in — late , as usual . “

119264	119381	119259	119259	We	3313	” she answered , and startled herself awake by saying in dream what had never been spoken in daylight . She lay in the rustling , dripping noise of the forest that night , eyes open , sorting out the shards of reality from which this was constructed . The coffee shop was in Cleveland , of course . How long ago had she first met Sandoz there ? she asked herself . Then , with more urgency , she wondered , How old am I ? Nearly fifty , she realized with a jolt . Seventeen years here , she thought . Longer than I lived in Istanbul . Longer than I 've lived anywhere . "

Ha'anala loved the stories that Sofia told to satisfy the child 's hunger for authoritative answers . So Sofia freely drew upon ancient parables to teach enduring morals , with slight emendations to allow for local conditions . The story of the Garden was a favorite because it seemed so like the forest in which they lived . Following Isaac on his solitary wanderings through the trees , it was easy to believe that they were all alone , with no one but God and each other for companions . But Ha'anala was her own person and drew her own conclusions and one day , she stopped in her tracks and said , “
121915	121956	121912	121912	God	295	” Startled , Sofia stopped as well and looked back at her , her eye moving CHILDREN OF GOD 257 » a a nervously between Isaac , who continued on his way , and Ha'anala , who stood her ground . “
121972	121999	122000	122000	God	263	” Ha'anala said in English , looking up at Sofia with her head cocked back , the image of her father about to issue a declaration . "

Sofia would report all this to Supaari in their daily radio contacts , sharing stories of his daughter 's insights , of her cleverness and creativity , her mischief and essential goodness . His reaction told Sofia a great deal . If he had been behind Runa lines for a time , he would soften and laugh and ask questions . But if he had been in a city , among the Jana’ata , steeped in Runa scent , dressed as a Runao , silently accepting humiliation and unthinking slights as he spied on fortifications and the strength of a garrison , then stories of his daughter 's squandered splendor would fuel his anger . “
122216	122231	122211	122211	They	3395	" he would say , with a cold fury that Sofia understood and shared . “
122239	122344	122345	122346	The people	1070	” And yet , he hardly ever visited Ha'anala . Sofia understood this , too . He could not let himself be weakened . He needed to focus on war 's clean and uncomplicated emotions . It was necessary that his daily companion be not a child of bright promise with no future but a Runao whose reputation for ferocity of devotion to the making of a new world matched his ownDjalao VaKashan . It seemed quite likely that they were lovers . Sofia knew that this was both possible and accepted , among VaRakhati of both species . Djalao had taken no husband . “
122351	122472	122345	122346	The people	1070	” she said . Sofia understood as well what Djalao represented to Supaari : respect earned and acceptance given , recognition that this one djanada was worthy to be called one of the People . Supaari shared danger with Djalao , Sofia told herself , and dreams and work . Why not share respite as well ? She did not begrudge them that small comfort . Another woman might have been jealous , but not Sofia Mendes . She had , after all , survived a great deal by blocking out emotion - her own and others ' . And love was a debt , best left unincurred . 258 Mary Doria Russell City of Gayjur 2082 , Earth - Relative "

126668	126684	126685	126685	Sean	390	“ Did y'ever wonder then why Orthodox Jews count lineage through the mother 's ancestry ? "
126688	126731	126685	126685	Sean	390	“ Strange , is n't it ? The entire Old Testament , filled with begats . Twelve tribes for the twelve sons of Jacob . But Jacob had a daughter , too . Remember ? Dina . The one who was raped . ”
126739	126782	126737	126737	Sandoz	261	“ And yet , there 's no Tribe of Dina . Patrilineage , all through the Torah ! Religion is conservative , as y'say . So why ? When was it declared that a Jew is the child of a Jewish mother ? "
126783	126792	126793	126793	Sandoz	261	“ I have always hated the Socratic method , "

126816	126847	126848	126848	Sean	390	“ Yes , so none of the children would be stigmatized as half - Jew or no Jew a - tall . And good for the rabbis , I say . "
126856	126861	126848	126848	Sean	390	“ What are y'then ? ”
126870	126925	126926	126926	He	261	“ So . To legitimize the children of rape , when rape was so common the rabbis had to overturn twenty - five hundred years of tradition to cope with it . Good girls and bad . Virgins and whores . Young and old alike . Devout and indifferent and apostate . All done . "
126936	126960	126926	126926	He	261	“ And not a one of 'em ever got an apology from God , nor from the fackin ' basturd who done her . ”
126967	126987	126961	126961	Sandoz	261	“ Your point is taken . I am neither the first nor the only person to be worked over . ”
126988	126992	126993	126993	Sean	390	“ So what ? "
126996	127004	126993	126993	Sean	390	“ Does it help to know that ? "
127010	127016	127017	127017	Sandoz	261	“ Not a blind bit , ”
127036	127041	127042	127042	Sean	390	“ Nor should it , ”
127045	127082	127083	127083	He	261	“ Sufferin ' may be banal and predictable , but it does n't hurt any less for all that . And it 's despicable to take comfort in knowin ' that others have suffered as well . ”
127090	127118	127083	127083	He	261	“ I 'm told y'blame God for what happened on Rakhat . Why y not blame Satan ? Do y'believe in the devil , then , Sandoz ? "
127119	127125	127126	127126	Sandoz	261	“ But that is irrelevant , "
127130	127145	127126	127126	Sandoz	261	“ Satan ruins people by tempting them to take an easy or pleasurable path . "
127161	127168	127169	127169	Sean	390	“ Spoken like a good Jesuit , ”
127174	127188	127169	127169	Sean	390	“ And there was nothin' easy nor pleasurable in what happened to you . ”
127196	127201	127202	127202	he	261	“ No . Nothing , ”
127211	127250	127202	127202	he	261	“ As fish are caught in a net and as birds are trapped , so are the children of men entrapped — this I experienced under the sun , and it seemed a great evil to me . ' ”
127251	127295	127303	127303	Sandoz	261	“ Ecclesiasticus . Omnia vanitas : All is vanity and chasing after the wind . The wicked prosper and the righteous get rooted up the hole , and is that all y'learned in a quarter of a century in the Company of Jesus ? "
127296	127302	127303	127303	Sandoz	261	“ Fuck off , Sean , "
127338	127348	127349	127349	Sean	390	“ Nowhere t'run now , Sandoz . Nowhere t'hide , ”
127367	127375	127376	127376	Sean	390	“ You were a priest for decades , ”
127382	127480	127376	127376	Sean	390	“ and a good one . Think like a priest , Sandoz . Think like a Jesuit ! What did a Jesus add to the canon , man ? If the Jews deserved one thing , it was a better answer to sufferin ' than the piss - poor one Job got . If pain and injustice and undeserved misery are part of the package , and God knows they are , then surely the life of Christ is God 's own answer to Ecclesiasticus ! Redeem the suffering . Embrace it . Make it mean something . "
127496	127523	127524	127524	Sean	390	“ Yer feelin ' it now , are n't you . Carlo stopped the Quell aerosol he 's been pumpin ' into yer room while y’slept , ”
127528	127574	127524	127524	Sean	390	“ There 's no way past the next forty - eight hours except through them . Y'watched a thousand babies die , slaughtered like lambs . Y'saw the bloody corpses one y'loved . You were gang - raped for months and when you were rescued , "
127624	127652	127619	127619	yer	3478	" ' Sandoz closed his eyes , but Sean 's voice went on , with its hard r 's and the flat , unmusical poetry of Belfast . “
127732	127785	127790	127790	y’can	3478	" Sean noticed only then that Daniel Iron Horse was standing silently be . hind a bulkhead just beyond the commons . Danny came forward and stood now in plain sight . For a moment , Sean frowned , unsure of Danny 's intention , but then it came clear to him . “
127814	128162	127809	127809	y	3478	" Sandoz would look at neither of them , and remained silent . But he did n't say no , and so Sean left and Danny stayed . SANDOZ SEEMED STUNNED IN THE BEGINNING BUT , BEFORE LONG , withdrawal began to work on him physically . Too tense to stay still , he needed to walk the pain out , and Danny followed him into the chilling silence of the lander bay , which was nearly thirty meters long and afforded him room to move , and privacy . For the first hours , Sandoz said nothing , but Danny knew the anger was coming and tried to brace himself for it . He believed that there was nothing Sandoz could say to him that he had not said to himself , but he was wrong . When Sandoz spoke at last , brutal mockery quickly escalated beyond rage to a pure moral fury , its expression informed by decades of Jesuit study . Tears , Daniel Iron Horse discovered that first morning , felt cold against skin flushed with shame . Then the silence settled in again . Danny left only twice on the first day , to go to the head . Sandoz paced and paced , and after a time , stripped off his shirt , sodden with sweat that leached the moisture from his body even in the numbing cold of the lander bay . A while later , he took off the braces as well and then sat down as far away from Danny as possible , near the exterior hangar - bay door , his back CHILDREN OF GOD 269 a against the sealed stone walls , head resting on arms wrapped around raised knees , the nearly dead fingers twitching sometimes . In spite of himself and his intentions , Danny fell asleep as the hours passed . He woke once and saw Sandoz standing at the bay door , staring into the darkness through the small porthole . Danny dropped off once again , only to hear the words “
128165	128217	127809	127809	y	3478	” sometime during the night . He was not sure of the language , but he remembered the words and , later on , asked the other priests if any of them understood . Both Joseba and John recognized the Spanish : Here I am . It was Sean who said , “
128229	128497	128221	128221	Abraham	364	” But Sandoz had said it with a kind of beaten resignation , and Danny thought it might only have signaled the man 's recognition that he was stuck on the Bruno , with nowhere to go but forward . Or perhaps it was the resignation of Jonah realizing that God would find him and use him no matter where he was , even in the belly of a whale . There was no dawn to wake Danny in the morning , but the noise and movement inside the commons room came muffled through the landerbay hatch . He sat up and then stood , stiff and miserable . Sandoz had not moved . Danny left again for a few minutes , but came back without eating , determined to take no food or drink while Sandoz went without . As the hours of the second full day crawled by , Sandoz remained motionless and silent , eyes fixed on distances no other man had seen . Vision quest , Danny thought , when the soul opened to whatever could be conveyed by the Great Mystery , Whose thoughts were not the thoughts of man , Whose ways were not the ways of man ... He had not wanted to sleep . Danny had resolved to witness it all from start to finish , and so he woke on the third morning with a start , only to find himself looking into the obsidian eyes of Emilio Sandoz , sitting crosslegged on the lander deck , where he had waited for Iron Horse to wake up . . "
128504	128544	128221	128221	Abraham	364	" Sandoz said after a time , his voice soft and unresonant in the echoing space of the bay . Danny was n't sure what he meant but , lately , nothing had been easy , so he nodded . "
128552	128556	128546	128546	you	3484	" Sandoz reported , “
128561	128562	128546	128546	you	3484	” “
128565	128575	128546	128546	you	3484	” Danny said almost inaudibly , identifying the quote . “
128579	128597	128546	128546	you	3484	” Waxen and exhausted , Sandoz got slowly to his feet and stood blankly for a while . “
128606	128687	128688	128688	He	0	” he said , and walked to the hatch , banging on it with an elbow . » a 270 Mary Doria Russell a In an instant , the sounds of pressure equalizers and locking mechanisms echoed emptily against the stone walls of the hull . When the door opened , Danny realized that John Candotti , too , had stood vigil during these three days . But the rest of the crew was there now as well , waiting . “
128695	128742	128691	128691	he	0	" Sandoz told them , and stepped through the hatch without another word . For the first time since his mother died when he was sixteen years old , Daniel Iron Horse broke down and sobbed . The others stood and listened until John Candotti said , “
128747	128802	128691	128691	he	0	” and the little crowd dispersed . After a decent interval , John ducked into the bay . He looked around and then retrieved Sandoz 's discarded shirt , offering it to Danny to blow his nose on . Danny accepted it , but reared away when he brought it closer to his face . “
128808	128812	128691	128691	he	0	” John admitted . “
128826	128849	128691	128691	he	0	" Danny managed a small laugh and pulled up his own shirt , wiping his nose on the inside of the collar . “
128860	128892	128893	128893	Mine	0	” John said , sliding down the wall next to Danny until his bony legs stuck straight out in front of him . Danny wiped his eyes and cleared his throat . "
128897	128918	128893	128893	Mine	0	” he said almost soundlessly . They both sat staring at the far end of the bay for a while . “
128923	128928	128893	128893	Mine	0	” John said finally , “
128947	128951	128945	128945	Pax	634	" Danny nodded . “
128967	129000	129001	129001	I	0	" he said . John got to his feet and offered the other man a hand up . Danny , redeyed and wrung dry , shook it gratefully , but he said , “
129017	129018	129012	129012	I	0	" “
129021	129042	129012	129012	I	0	” John said , and left Danny alone . a : 26 Great Southern Forest 2061 , Earth - Relative 66 "

129907	130014	129865	129866	The people	1070	" -new CHILDREN OF GOD 273 The conversation receded , only to be replaced by the patternless noise of the forest : squawking , buzzing , dripping . Shrieks and whistled arpeggios ; snuffling , rustling . Nearly as bad as the village . The forest , at least , had no baffling jumble of talk and intonation , no half - grasped meaning shrouded by the next words . Impasto , Isaac thought . This is worse than red . The village is an impasto of words . The forest is an impasto of sounds . There is no clarity ! He had found the word “
130016	130064	129865	129866	The people	1070	” in one of Marc Robichaux 's files . He looked it up in the dictionary and saw a naked hand with five fingers applying dabs of molten color in many layers , each one almost concealing the others beneath it . For a long time now , "
130066	130076	129865	129866	The people	1070	” had been his best word , but he liked "
130078	130200	129865	129866	The people	1070	” very much . He appreciated the nicety of its meaning , how neatly it fit his desire to label a perception . When he could focus on one word at a time , the meaning of things could come clear for him , like a high note rising out of a choir , and there was joy in that . But there was no clarity in the village and it was difficult to make the distractions go away long enough — Ha'anala stopped and sat just outside his little rectangular shelter . Isaac , too , stopped and rethought his thought about impasto from beginning to end . Then he handed Ha'anala his tablet without meeting her eyes and said , “
130206	130311	129865	129866	The people	1070	” He told her that every time , just as Sofia had told him that over and over , when she first let him have the computer . For a while , he thought becarefulwithit was the name of the computer . There were very few of these tablets in the world , he found out eventually , although the people had made other things they sloppily labeled computer even though such things were clearly different from his tablet and could n't be carried around ; so this one was still precious , and not only to Isaac . He waited until Ha'anala said , "
130317	130339	130312	130312	Someone	1080	" and then he smiled , face lifted to the suns . She said that every time . Haʼanala had clarity . “
130347	130352	130344	130345	No Runa	3505	” he said loudly . “
130356	130725	129865	129866	The people	1070	” Haʼanala replied dutifully . Imantat was a relatively quiet Runao who kept the rainroof thatched . Ha'anala herself stayed out of Isaac 's line of sight as he went to work removing all the detritus that had blown or fallen or grown into his little fortress since his last visit . It took some time . When everything was properly squared up , all the curves and mess done away with , he held out his hand and the tablet appeared in it without anyone having to say anything . It weighed less than before . Once it had taken all his thin - boned , sixyear - old strength to heft it , but now it was so light he could grasp it easily 274 Mary Doria Russell with one hand . This gradual loss of weight was a sly betrayal that Isaac had not overlooked ; he always inspected the tablet minutely , vigilant for other changes . Satisfied , he placed the computer tablet on a flat rock he 'd brought here from the river , to keep the tablet out of the mud . Rain was no threat , but his mother had always told him to keep the tablet clean . With a special stick he kept for this purpose , he measured off the distance from each edge of the tablet to the shelter 's walls , so that it was perfectly centered . He held out his hand and this time the blue cloth appeared . Pulling this over his head , he sat down on the western side of the shelter and draped the shawl over the tablet as well . Oblivious now to the slanting shafts of three - toned light filtering through the canopy 's breeze - driven movement , he began to relax . Then : the feel of the latch against his thumb , the soft snick of the mechanism , the lovely arc of hinged movement describing in a single sweep - acute to obtuse — the unchanging geometry of the cover . The simultaneous whirr of power - on , the brightening of the screen , the familiar keyboard with its serried ranks . "
130730	130734	130728	130728	Isaac	363	" Ha'anala said . "
130741	130996	130728	130728	Isaac	363	" She knew how long to wait before asking this question , and she always asked the same way , and he always chose the same piece : Supaari 's voice , the evening chant . First Isaac listened silently . Then again , singing harmony . Then again , with his own harmony and with Ha'anala joining in to . double Supaari 's part . He followed the same pattern with the Sh’ma , Sofia 's voice solo , replayed so he could harmonize , and a third time with Ha'anala doubling Sofia . Finally he could move on , choosing from the Magellan 's stored collection of songs , symphonies , cantatas and chants ; the quartets and trios , the concertos and rondos ; Gaelic jigs and Viennese waltzes ; the lush four - part harmonies of a cappella Brooklyn doo - wop and the whining dissonance of Chinese opera ; the modal and rhythmic shifts of an Arabic taqasim . Music entered Isaac 's heart directly and effortlessly . It slipped into his soul like a leaf settling into clear , still water , sinking silkily beneath the shining surface . Having purged the noise and confusion of the village and the forest , Isaac 's mind became as orderly and precise as the keyboard . He could begin again to explore the Magellan 's vast on - line library , reading steadily with emotionless concentration every item found in the Magellan catalog on whatever subject had snared his interest . “
130999	131043	130728	130728	Isaac	363	” he sighed , and began to study . CHILDREN OF GOD 275 THE WHOLE VILLAGE WAS HAPPY TO SEE Haʼanala LEAD ISAAC OFF when he became disruptive ; they praised her for being so kind to him , for watching over him . “
131050	131246	131046	131048	a good father	3507	” the people said , smiling a little at that . Even Sofia was grateful . But it was no sacrifice to accompany Isaac to this refuge , for if her brother craved clarity , Haʼanala was starved for privacy . It amounted to the same thing , she supposed . For years , Isaac had mostly echoed others and even Sofia had come to believe that he was all but incapable of direct speech . Then one day , wearied by the village noise , feeling fragmented and exasperated herself , Ha'anala had simply acted on an impulse . She was younger than Isaac , but far stronger if not taller , so when he began to spin and hum , she simply grabbed his ankle and marched him off to a place in the forest where it was quiet . She had expected silence from him , or at worst some meaningless phrase repeated over and over until it meant even less . Only later did Ha'anala realize that her own exhausted , petulant silence had permitted Isaac to complete a thought and then to repeat it aloud . And such a thought ! “
131258	131377	131378	131378	Sipaj	311	" ? He said nothing more that day , but Haʼanala spent hours considering his words . A soul , she decided , was the most real part of a person , and to discover what is real requires privacy . In the village , every act , every word , every decision or desire was examined and commented on and compared , debated , evaluated and reconsidered — participated in ! How could she tell who she was , when everything she did acquired a council of 150 people ? If she so much as hid her eyes behind her hands or clamped her ears shut for a moment , a solicitous Runao would approach and inquire , “
131387	131560	131380	131380	Ha'anala	452	” And then everyone would discuss her recent meals , her stools , the condition of her coat , whether her eyes were hurting her , and if that might be because there had lately been more sunlight and less rain than usual , and if that meant the dji'll harvest would be late this year , and how would that affect the market for k’jip , which was always combined with dji'll ... So Haʼanala thanked God that Isaac 's ability to tolerate the village commotion was even more limited than her own . She had never told Sofia about the things Isaac said during their times alone . This was a source of guilt . Haʼanala sometimes felt as though she had stolen something from Sofia , who wanted so much for Isaac to speak to her . Once , when Ha'anala heard Isaac yawn underneath his head covering , 276 Mary Doria Russell and knew that he was done reading and could tolerate a question , she had asked , “
131574	131575	131576	131576	She	3511	” "
131581	131586	131587	131587	She	3511	” he said tonelessly . “
131593	131606	131587	131587	She	3511	” Isaac had twice typed a message on the tablet to Sofia . “
131611	131661	131587	131587	She	3511	” was the first . Their mother had wept at it : his only words to her a rebuff . But later , during the period of intense frustration and fear that occurred when he came to the end of some line of obsessive research , he had asked , "
131671	131672	131663	131663	I	0	” “
131675	131681	131663	131663	I	0	” Sofia had typed back . “
131684	131800	131663	131663	I	0	" He seemed glad , but that single reassurance was all he wanted from her . Ha'anala sighed , saddened by the memory , and settled back against a sun - warmed boulder , closing her eyes . Midday heat and boredom joined with an adolescent carnivore 's physiology to conspire against consciousness , but her drowsiness that day was compounded by Isaac 's latest craze . He had set himself the task of memorizing every base pair in human DNA , having assigned a musical note to represent each of the four bases — adenine , cytosine , guanine and thymine . He would listen to the monotonous four - note sequences for hours . “
131805	131814	131803	131803	Isaac	363	” she 'd asked when this jag started , “
131820	131821	131817	131817	you	363	" “
131824	131920	131817	131817	you	363	” he said , and this struck Haʼanala as unusually pointless , even for Isaac . Even Sofia had become more distant in the past few years , often doing , several things at once , listening to the Runa discussions while working through reports or preparing weather data for dissemination to the officers or coordinating the delivery of supplies to a salient . Over and over , Ha'anala tried to help , distressed by Sofia 's isolation , wanting to be her partner even while she resented her mother 's patent , unspoken needs . “
131929	132071	131817	131817	you	363	” Sofia would say , closing Ha'anala out as effectively as Isaac could . Sofia seemed to come fully alive only when she spoke of justice , but as the years went by , even that topic elicited silence . None of the people welcomed Haʼanala 's interest in the war , and her questions were adroitly deflectedThey are ashamed , Ha'anala realized . They wish me not to know , but I do . I will be the last of my kind . They have begun something that can end only one way . Sofia and Isaac might be right , she thought , drowsing . Stay distant , keep your heart hidden , do n't want what you ca n't have ... She had been asleep for some time when she heard Isaac 's blaring , toneless voice announce , “
132082	132083	132078	132078	Someone	1080	” “
132087	132095	132078	132078	Someone	1080	” she murmured , without really rousing . “
132105	132110	132111	132111	SIPA	173	” CHILDREN OF GOD 277 “
132116	132123	132114	132114	PEOPLE	950	” SOFIA CALLED OUT HOURS LATER . “
132136	132157	132130	132130	anyone	5249	" Puska VaTrucha - Sai separated from the knot of girls chattering about their assignments , and looked around curiously . “
132167	132172	132173	132173	Sipaj	311	” she reminded Fia . “
132177	132185	132175	132175	Puska	308	” her father , Kanchay , called , “
132199	132200	132186	132186	you	308	” “
132206	132273	132186	132186	you	308	” Puska muttered , to the scandalized laughter of the other girls . Puska did n't care . A year in the army was more than enough to coarsen a woman 's attitudes and language , and she had chosen the mildest of the vulgarities that came to mind — these recruits would learn the others soon enough . Puska smiled at the girls and said , “
132280	132525	132526	132526	Sipaj	311	” with the exaggerated sincerity that covers rock - hard cynicism , and loped off to find Fia 's children . It took her perhaps twice - twelve paces to get beyond the shelters and storage huts , and again that many to pass out of earshot of the village noise . Puska had dreamed of home nearly every night of her first month in the city of Mo’arl ; yearning for the forest 's peace and security , she 'd sought refuge there in sleep when daylight was filled with shock and outrage and sadness . For a time , she 'd envied Ha'anala , safe forever in the village . Now , Trucha Sai seemed cramped and limited , and Puska could understand why Ha'anala was so often bad - tempered and restless . The roofline of Isaac 's shelter came into view , a cha'ar past the settlement 's edge . Imantat 's work was not as sturdy as that of his father , who was a master thatcher , but the boy showed promise : the shelter had held up well during the last storm . Someone will need a husband soon , Puska thought , and made a mental note to bring this up with the council , for she had seen enough of war to know that babies should not be postponed , and the people would need a child to replace her if she fell in battle . “
132530	132539	132526	132526	Sipaj	311	” Puska called as she approached the hut , "
132551	132562	132563	132563	Stew	642	” There was no response — the shelter was empty . "
132565	132611	132563	132563	Stew	642	" she swore under her breath . Ha'anala could n't see in redlight and Isaac could see too well . He needed to get under the sleeping shelters , where he could n't see the red in the sky , or there 'd be trouble . “
132622	132627	132614	132614	Someone	1080	” Puska teased loudly . “
132635	132636	132629	132629	Isaac	363	" “
132640	132652	132629	132629	Isaac	363	” Haʼanala yelled from a distance . а 278 Mary Doria Russell "
132657	132697	132698	132698	He	363	" Puska shouted back , cocking her ears toward the sound , relieved to hear Ha'anala 's voice at last . Already losing contrast , hands out in front of her , Ha'anala moved uncertainly toward Isaac 's hut . “
132703	132727	132728	132728	Isaac	363	” she cried , lifting a foot to rub the opposite shin where she 'd crashed into a fallen log a moment earlier . "
132731	132738	132728	132728	Isaac	363	” Puska 's ears came up . "
132763	132774	132775	132775	Sipaj	311	” Stumbling over a root , Ha'anala snarled in frustration . “
132805	132837	132801	132801	someone	1080	” Puska strode decisively to Haʼanala 's side and began to smooth the younger girl 's face , running her hands along the sides of Haʼanala 's long , thin cheeks . "
132843	132855	132801	132801	someone	1080	” she crooned , falling back into the habits of childhood . “
132862	132866	132801	132801	someone	1080	” Puska warned . “
132873	132903	132904	132904	We	3531	” And it would wipe out Isaac 's scent , Ha'anala realized , before she could dispute the meteorological effects of emotional distress . She stood at full height . “
132940	132941	132938	132938	Fia	305	” “
132948	132954	132943	132943	you	308	” Puska started to protest . “
132959	132998	132943	132943	you	308	” Ha'anala said carefully . Evidence of Isaac 's passage fairly glowed for her : his footprints bright with scent , the leaves he 'd brushed past powdered with shed skin cells and misted with his expelled breath . “
133045	133096	133097	133097	Sipaj	311	” Puska swayed from side to side as she considered this . On the left foot : Isaac might be lost . On the right foot : she should go back to the village and get permission . On the left foot : it smelled like rain . On the right- “
133101	133105	133097	133097	Sipaj	311	” Ha'anala pleaded , “
133152	133180	133181	133182	THE PEOPLE	643	” Which settled it for Puska . One person made a puzzle . Two people made a discussion . Three made a plan . CHILDREN OF GOD 279 "
133191	133227	133186	133187	THE DJANADA	644	" PUSKA POINTED out , worried from the moment she awoke the next morning . She looked up at Ha'anala , who was a little distance away , poised on a tail and one leg . "
133238	133271	133228	133228	Someone	1080	” Ha'anala did n't respond , afraid she 'd alarm her breakfast , which was about to move within reach , directly beneath her suspended foot . Patience . . . patience ... "
133275	133286	133228	133228	Someone	1080	" she cried , grasping a small , scaly lonat . “
133293	133311	133287	133287	We	3534	” she told Puska firmly , pinching the animal 's neck between a pedal thumb and forefinger . “
133325	133341	133318	133318	someone	1080	" Puska 's face contorted , watching the lonat 's twitches subside into limp stillness . “
133350	133351	133343	133343	you	3541	" “
133356	133370	133343	133343	you	3541	” Haʼanala said , shooting a foot out to grip Puska 's ankle . "
133379	133391	133375	133375	Someone	1080	" she cried when Puska jumped and wrenched her leg free . "
133404	133408	133410	133410	you	3541	” Puska shuddered . “
133420	133448	133414	133414	I	0	” Ha'anala 's mouth dropped open and Puska stopped , embarrassed by her own self - referential crudity . I really have gotten bad , she thought . “
133451	133475	133476	133476	Someone	1080	” she apologized and held out a hand for the lonat , holding her breath as she scraped the scales from its legs . “
133486	133487	133488	133488	Someone	1080	” "
133497	133550	133488	133488	Someone	1080	" Ha'anala muttered , biting off a nasty little haunch when Puska handed the thing back to her . The main virtue of lonati was that they were easy to catch . Both Ha'anala and her father were used to the small , poor prey they could sometimes capture to supplement offerings of "
133554	133572	133488	133488	Someone	1080	” as it was delicately referred to , but eating was always a hurried , furtive task . “
133581	133597	133598	133598	You	3546	" Ha'anala asked , trying to divert Puska 's horrified fascination with the tiny carcass . "
133605	133764	133598	133598	You	3546	" Puska told her with evident disgust , and left to find herself some rainberries for breakfast . THEY PRESSED ON , PUSKA INCREASINGLY EXASPERATED , Haʼanala ALmost as irritable . Traces of Isaac 's passing had been trampled by forest things — sweating , panting , defecating in the humid heat - and she lost the scent repeatedly as his path veered unexpectedly toward patches of fruiting bush . Even when she caught his course again , it was mingled with clouds of vraloj pollen and the stench of rotting plants , and difficult to fol- 280 Mary Doria Russell low . By their fourth day on the trail , Puska was complaining bitterly and continuously , and stopped to forage with resentful thoroughness while Ha'anala fumed and clawed under logs for bitter grubs , silent and ravenous and more determined with every passing moment to run Isaac to ground and haul him back by his ankle . "
133769	133775	133598	133598	You	3546	” Puska warned that night . “
133786	133793	133794	133794	Ha'anala	452	“ Isaac will be even hungrier , ”
134054	134057	134058	134058	Haʼanala	441	“ Gone , ”
134071	134077	134058	134058	Haʼanala	441	" Someone has lost him . "
134078	134089	134090	134090	Puska	308	" He lost himself . You tried to find him , ”
134110	134113	134094	134094	She	308	“ Tohome . "
134114	134121	134122	134122	Haʼanala	441	“ How can I tell Sofia ? "
134127	134132	134094	134094	She	308	“ Isaac is gone . "

134166	134174	134157	134158	Fat Frans	533	“ Is suicide still considered a sin ? ”
134175	134181	134203	134203	Frans	533	“ It depends . Why ? "
134182	134201	134203	134203	Frans	533	“ Well , for the sake of your theoretically immortal soul , I 'll give you some advice , ”
134205	134216	134203	134203	Frans	533	“ Never get into a plane piloted by Emilio Sandoz . ”
134230	134238	134203	134203	Frans	533	" He ca n't be that bad ! "
134239	134257	134259	134259	Frans	533	“ I 'm telling you , Johnny , I 've never seen anyone with less natural ability , ”
134271	134289	134259	134259	Frans	533	“ Nico , tell Don Gianni how long it took you to learn to fly the lander . ”

134339	134356	134358	134358	Frans	533	" His brain must be completely crammed with languages . As far as I can tell , ”
134367	134422	134358	134358	Frans	533	“ there is not one spare synapse available for flight training . Look , I admire perseverance as much as the next man , but this is pointless . Even D. W.

134432	134475	134423	134423	Frans	533	“ ' As a pilot , Father Sandoz is one hell of a linguist and a pretty fair medic . So I am taking him off flight training and assigning him to permanent passenger status , to avoid getting anybody killed . ' ”

135732	135786	135787	135787	He	526	“ So , barring a more interesting avenue to relief and rest , what shall it be tonight ? Quick oblivion , I hope . Perhaps I should have Nico move the treadmill into the sick bay so the rest of us do n't have to listen to you pounding away all night . "
135801	135826	135787	135787	He	526	" You 're building up a tolerance to this , by the way . I 've doubled the dosage over the past two weeks . ”

136057	136105	136053	136053	Carlo	526	“ I thought , This is revenge — he 's getting his own back . Later I thought , This is an ex - Jesuit who has taken orders all his life . Now he gives them . He is drunk with power . Now , however , ”

136129	136206	136207	136207	Carlo	526	“ Your father was right about you , Cio - Cio - San . If you ever finished anything , you could be judged , and found wanting . So you find a reason to quit and tell yourself lies about Renaissance princes . Then you move on to the next thing before you can demonstrate inadequacy . My coup d'état suits your purposes because now you have someone you can blame when this venture fails . ”
136218	136260	136207	136207	Carlo	526	“ It is not power or revenge that drives you , Sandoz . It is fear . You are afraid , all day , . every day . And the closer we get to Rakhat , the more frightened you become . ”
136313	136318	136319	136319	Carlo	526	“ You are afraid , ”

Finally Sandoz willed the trembling to stop , and when he spoke , his eyes were so hard and his voice so soft that his words seemed to John a vicious insult . “

Sometimes I think , maybe it 's better this way . The screaming would have scared Celestina , you know ? What kind of life is that for a little kid , growing up with her stepfather screaming every night ? ”

They would be able to monitor any radio transmission on Rakhat , via the Magellan , and tap all its resources , but they themselves could not be located . The Magellan 's systems would record only that their tablet 's sig . nals had passed by way of one of the satellite relays positioned over the continent . Sofia would know that much : they were still on the continent . Ha'anala sat thinking for a long time , trying to find the words to tell Sofia that there were Jana'ata who were good and decent , that justice could become tainted with revenge . But she knew what the people thought of those who collaborated with the djanada ; no matter how nuanced , her words would be understood as treachery . Throat tight , Ha'anala opened the connection to the Magellan . The enormity of her decision made speech impossible ; she pecked out a short message with a single claw . “

148777	148851	148769	148769	you	0	" There was a round of grunted agreement with that sentiment , and for the first time since the voyage had begun , a sort of communal contentment took hold as they ate and drank and the talk became general . They were all aware of the fragile sense of being on the same team , but no one dared comment on it , until the end of the meal when Nico said , “
148859	148885	148769	148769	you	0	” A small silence settled in then , as it will at any dinner party , but it was broken by Danny Iron Horse saying , “

149203	149212	149213	149213	he	261	“ Get my tablet , please , Nico , ”
149221	149229	149213	149213	he	261	“ When did this arrive , Danny ? "
149230	149234	149252	149252	Sandoz	261	" Last week . ”
149235	149251	149252	149252	Sandoz	261	“ Let me see if I understand the process by which we received this transmission , "
149263	149365	149366	149366	he	261	“ When these songs were first broadcast on Rakhat , they were automatically collected by the Magellan , encoded , compressed and packeted , yes ? Held in memory , and not sent out until the stars were right . Picked up at home by radio telescopes over four years after the Magellan sent them . Sold by the Contact Consortium to the Jesuits , no doubt after a period of negotiation over price . Studied , packeted again . Shot off to us , after what ? Two years , perhaps ? And we 're now moving at maximum velocity ? ”
149376	149422	149366	149366	he	261	“ So more years have gone by since the packet caught up with us last week , because of the relativity effects . I have no idea what that adds up to , but it 's old news , Danny—. Ah , grazie , Nico . ”
149462	149480	149481	149481	he	261	“ The word is related , I think , to a stem word for change : sohraa , ”
149486	149573	149481	149481	he	261	“ The first syllable is an intensifier , of course . The term is , I think , a poetic neologism , but I am not familiar with this construction . It could be archaic rather than new , yes ? It combines sohraa with a stem that implies a breaking out or breaking free : hramaut . The only time I heard that was when Supaari took me to his courtyard to show me a small animal that was emerging from a kind of chrysalis . ”
149582	149616	149574	149574	His	261	“ If I must guess , I would say the force of the word is emancipation , perhaps . The theme of the entire piece is perhaps joy at the breaking of bonds . ”
149648	149668	149643	149643	Danny	385	“ You agree that this is Kitheri 's composition ? His style , both in lyric and musical form ? "
149674	149678	149679	149679	Danny	385	“ The voices ? "
149682	149696	149679	149679	Danny	385	“ Who is singing ? Not who . I mean , what species ? ”
149697	149717	149718	149718	Sandoz	261	“ The basses , of course , are male Jana'ata . The others are of a much higher register , "
149722	149725	149726	149726	Nico	518	“ Scuzi , ”
149730	149740	149726	149726	Nico	518	“ What does emanci- . What is that word ? ”
149752	149757	149718	149718	Sandoz	261	” Emilio told him . “

149781	149785	149779	149779	they	429	” Nico suggested . “

149921	149926	149919	149919	Sandoz	261	” Danny said carefully , “
149937	149951	149954	149954	you	261	" Sandoz cut the rising noise of speculation off , staring at Danny . “
149988	150001	150002	150002	I	0	" He glanced at the Earth - relative time - date readout . "
150032	150049	150050	150050	I	0	” he said , glancing cold - eyed at Carlo . There was an uneasy quiet . “

150275	150291	150253	150253	you	3933	” Danny absorbed that like the slap in the face it was meant to be . “
150294	150298	150253	150253	you	3933	” Sandoz continued , “
150340	150341	150335	150335	I	0	” “
150351	150361	150335	150335	I	0	” Joseba remarked , still taken by the idea . “
150384	150401	150404	150404	Joseba	395	” He stopped when Sandoz rose abruptly and walked to the other side of the room . "
150408	150412	150404	150404	Joseba	395	" Sandoz asked . “
150420	150421	150459	150459	y'never	3937	" “
150430	150456	150459	150459	y'never	3937	” Sean Fein suggested quietly . He nearly recanted under the sear of the black - eyed stare , but forced himself to go on . “
150464	150468	150462	150462	Sandoz	261	” he cried . “
150510	150511	150516	150516	Emilio	261	" "
150518	150524	150516	150516	Emilio	261	” said John with urgency . “
150547	150551	150552	150552	he	261	“ All right , ”
150559	150626	150552	150552	he	261	“ For the sake of argument , let 's assume that unintended consequences can be for good as well as ill . The trouble with your proposition , as applied to my case , is that there was never any opportunity for me to give Hlavin Kitheri or his associates a stirring sermon on liberty or the value of souls — Jana'ata , Runa or human . ”
150647	150677	150678	150678	He	261	“ I do n't recall being allowed to say a single word , actually . I did scream a quite a bit — fairly incoherently , I 'm afraid . ”
150704	150750	150751	150751	He	261	“ And I fought like a sonofabitch to keep those fuckers off me , but I doubt even the most charitable of observers would have called that a display of a courage . ‘ An amusing exercise in futility ' may have come to mind . "
150758	150763	150764	150764	he	261	“ So you see , ”
150768	150784	150764	150764	he	261	“ I do n't think there is a shred of hope that anyone abstracted any edifying "
150823	151066	150806	150806	I	0	" a THE OTHERS WATCHED , BLINKING IN THE AFTERMATH , AS SANDOZ LEFT the room under his own power . No one noticed when Nico , standing unobserved in the corner , left the commons as well and went to his cabin . Opening the storage cabinet on the wall over his desk , Nico rummaged through his small collection of personal treasures and located two hard cylinders of unequal length : one and a half Genoa salamis he had hoarded away . Laying them on his desk , he sat down and breathed in the fragrance of garlic while giving serious thought to the issue of salami . He considered how much he had left , and how long it would be before he could buy more , and how Don Emilio felt when he had a bad headache . It would be a waste to give salami to a person who was only going to throw it up . Still , Nico thought , a present could make a person feel better , and Don Emilio could save it for later when the headache was gone . People often laughed at Nico for taking things too seriously . They would say something seriously , and he would take it seriously , and then be embarrassed when it turned out that they were only joking . He could rarely tell the difference between that kind of joking and sensible talk . "
151074	151084	151072	151072	Nico	518	” Don Emilio had explained to him one night . "
151124	151125	151101	151101	you	3943	” "

151159	151164	151132	151132	Frans	533	” Sandoz said honestly . “
151231	151315	151363	151364	Buon giorno	675	” Don Emilio was always serious , so Nico could relax and not try to find CHILDREN OF GOD 315 hidden jokes . He never made fun of Nico and he took extra time to teach him and made it easy to remember the foreign words . All that , Nico decided , was definitely worth half a salami . a THE LAST THING EMILIO SANDOZ WANTED WAS A VISITOR , BUT WHEN HE responded to the knock on his door with a parsimonious “
151319	151362	151363	151364	Buon giorno	675	” there were no footsteps and he could tell that whoever it was intended to stay there as long as necessary . Sighing , he opened the door and was not surprised to find Nico d'Angeli waiting expectantly in the curving hall . “
151368	151373	151366	151366	Nico	518	” he said patiently . “
151387	151388	151366	151366	Nico	518	” “
151395	151400	151392	151393	Don Emilio	418	” Nico responded pleasantly . “
151409	151488	151401	151401	I	0	" Emilio took a deep breath , and almost gagged on the smell of garlic , but he stepped away from the door , inviting Nico in . As was his habit , he moved to the farthest corner of his small room and sat on his bed , back against the bulkhead . Nico perched on the edge of the desk chair and then leaned forward to place half a salami on the foot of the bunk . “
151502	151518	151499	151500	Don Emilio	418	” he said without further explanation . Gravely , and breathing shallowly , Emilio said , “
151537	151538	151539	151539	I	0	” “
151568	151582	151583	151583	You	0	” Nico pointed out . Smiling in spite of everything , Emilio said , “
151598	151599	151596	151596	you	0	" "
151606	151611	151612	151612	You	418	” Nico asked anxiously . “
151627	151628	151630	151630	you	418	” “
151652	151700	151646	151646	I	0	” He sounded more certain than he was : the garlic was staggering . But this was clearly a present of significance from Nico , so he slid down the bed and picked up the salami with both hands , to signify his wholehearted acceptance of it . “
151711	151715	151704	151704	me	0	” he said . “
151722	151863	151717	151717	you	518	" Nico nodded and pulled out a pocketknife and then smiled at him shyly : a rare occurrence and one that was remarkably cheering . Dutifully , Emilio unwrapped the salami , a process that went fairly easily because his hands were okay today . Nico took it from him . Drawing his blade toward 316 Mary Doria Russell » his thumb with great care , he cut two round , slender wafers from the end . Emilio found himself accepting one of these with the kind of dignity he 'd once reserved for a consecrated Host . It 's only a pig , he reminded himself , and managed to swallow after a while . Nico , chewing , beamed greasily around his slice , but then remembered something he 'd been meaning to say for some time now . “
151867	151871	151717	151717	you	518	" he began , “
151879	151885	151874	151874	you	418	" Sandoz shook his head . “

151959	151963	151964	151964	I	0	” Nico insisted . “
151971	151989	151990	151990	Nico	518	” No excuses about following Carlo 's orders . No hedges . No self - serving justifications . “
151992	152003	151990	151990	Nico	518	" Emilio said with the quiet formality the occasion required , “
152017	152023	152011	152011	you	518	” Cautious , Nico pressed , “
152027	152028	152011	152011	you	518	" “
152032	152044	152011	152011	you	518	” Emilio confirmed . Nico looked solemnly glad to hear this . “

152072	152089	152070	152070	Nico	518	" Emilio said after a time , astonished by how much it helped to know this . “
152101	152107	152091	152091	you	518	" Heartened , Nico asked , “
152126	152127	152128	152128	I	0	" "
152135	152139	152133	152133	Nico	518	" Emilio admitted . “
152197	152198	152253	152253	you	518	” “
152204	152223	152253	152253	you	518	" Nico observed . Emilio 's face softened and he gazed at the big man with real affection . “
152233	152245	152247	152247	you	518	” He was glad Nico had stopped by , he realized . “
152265	152266	152253	152253	you	518	" “
152275	152293	152272	152273	Don Emilio	418	” Nico said seriously , mimicking Sandoz 's own tone and words as he often did now . "
152315	152319	152312	152312	my	0	” Emilio nodded . “
152327	152333	152325	152325	Nico	518	” But Nico went on , “
152391	152478	152388	152388	I	0	” Which was a great deal harder to accept , but might have some germ of truth . ... Emilio stood then , to signal the end of the visit , and Nico rose as well , but did not move to the door . Instead he reached down and gently lifted Sandoz 's right hand and bent low over it , to kiss it . Embarrassed , Emilio tried to draw back , to refuse this homage , but Nico 's gentle grip seemed unbreakable . “
152482	152486	152388	152388	I	0	” Nico said , “
152495	152550	152487	152487	I	0	” Emilio , who understood this code , looked away and tried to imagine how he could respond to such a display of undeserved devotion . There seemed only one reply possible and , eyes closed , he examined himself to see if he could say this with the honesty such a man deserved . “
152556	152561	152554	152554	Nico	518	" he said finally . “

Puska VaTrucha - Sai was a respected parliamentary elder in Gayjur when Joseba first met her , and he often found her viewpoint illuminating as he and the other priests pieced together the history of the Runa revolution . “

153790	153814	153815	153815	Sipaj	311	” He stood his ground , but it was not easy : a Runao risen up in righteous anger was a formidable menace . “

158637	158788	158610	158610	she	4214	" » IT WAS WELL PAST FIRST SUNDOWN LONG DAYS LATER WHEN THEY SAW the monster . Perched on two bony legs , it was naked , and hairless but for a beard and mane and mystifying patches of fur here and there , and it held a parasol made of frayed blue fabric high over its head . Beyond surprise even at a sight so bizarre , none of the refugees spoke . Neither did the monster . It simply stood in their way . Without warning , a Jana’ata appeared . Many Runa broke free of paralysis then , and moved to place their bodies between their charges and this stranger . When they realized the Jana’ata was unarmored , with a small child riding his back , they looked at each other in confusion , no longer knowing who was a danger and who could be trusted . "
158794	158800	158789	158789	I	0	" the man called out . “
158906	158926	158927	158932	Your brother - in - law	4225	” From somewhere in the little knot of weary bewildered women , a voice cried out in irritable protest , “
158943	158954	158938	158939	a foreigner	3001	" But before Shetri could answer , Rukuei came forward . "
158969	158973	158955	158955	I	0	” he shouted . “
158986	158987	158955	158955	I	0	” "
159002	159057	158991	158992	dead men	4228	” Shetri replied , not unkindly , but with no intention of being drawn into combat with an exhausted youth . He had seen this aggressive terror in so many CHILDREN OF GOD 331 a boys : still reeling from the deaths of fathers , uncles , brothers , and ashamed to be alive . “
159094	159116	159069	159076	a warrior of indifferent conviction and less skill	4230	” he said , glancing at Taksayu and the other Runa before returning his eyes to the boy 's and adding , “
159147	159193	159195	159195	me	0	" Befuddled by the soft response , the boy was speechless . He was also swaying with fatigue and his feet were torn to tatters , Shetri noted . But it would be an insult to offer him any aid , so Shetri simply said , “
159201	159223	159195	159195	me	0	” It was then that a woman of middle years came toward him and rested her hand briefly on his arm . “
159229	159252	159225	159227	a lovely child	4234	” she said , trying not to let her voice quaver as she gazed up at the baby on Shetri 's back . “
159257	159258	159225	159227	a lovely child	4234	" “
159261	159290	159225	159227	a lovely child	4234	” Shetri agreed neutrally , knowing that she was working through the genealogical possibilities . She drew in a small breath as she drew also the inevitable conclusion . “
159304	159322	159225	159227	a lovely child	4234	" she asked from behind a finely woven veil , torn now and unraveling from one edge . “
159325	159352	159225	159227	a lovely child	4234	” Shetri said again , preparing to be attacked , if not injured . But the woman merely spoke to the boy who had challenged Shetri . “
159355	159366	159353	159353	Rukuei	594	” she said , finding some reserve of stateliness within , "
159402	159412	159389	159389	I	0	" She turned back to Shetri Laaks and straightened . “
159430	159449	159450	159450	Your	594	” Shetri 's visible astonishment allowed her a moment of restored superiority , but Suukmel was a realist . “
159471	159484	159467	159468	1 .	4245	" she corrected herself , holding out her other hand to Taksayu , “
159505	159506	159467	159468	1 .	4245	” “
159520	159544	159467	159468	1 .	4245	” said Shetri , tearing his eyes away from the boy he now recognized as a young , male version of his wife . “
159558	159559	159561	159561	they	4248	” “
159564	159595	159561	159561	they	4248	” Isaac asked then in the flat , toneless speaking voice so eerily at odds with the high purity of his singing . Suukmel , uneasy , looked to Shetri . “
159605	159630	159596	159601	My brother - in - law	4218	" a 332 Mary Doria Russell Shetri explained minimally , knowing she was too tired to take in more . But Suukmel answered Isaac . “
159644	159648	159636	159636	He	594	” she said . “
159654	159670	159636	159636	He	594	” she added for his pride 's sake . Isaac did not look at anyone . “
159675	159732	159671	159671	He	594	" was all he said . 31 : N’Jarr Valley 2072 , Earth - Relative a IT WAS NOT COWARDICE OR WEAKNESS THAT UNDERMINED RUKUEI 's bright , fierce resolve to return to the south and fight on . It was the unanswerable question he heard in his dead father 's voice , melodic with irony : “
159743	160309	159739	159741	Some Runa horde	4253	" Had his mother been of first rank , or even second , Rukuei would now be Paramount Presumptive , but she was only a third . Was a concubine 's child entitled to fight as his people 's champion ? There were no ranked half - brothers to inherit in their own right , nor any uncles to serve as regent while he was trained , if the law held the patrimony his . Who then is Paramount ? Rukuei asked himself , no longer seeing the exhausted women and children around him , or the stranger with the baby or the freakish foreigner , or the eroded hills and gorges revealed as he and the others followed Shetri Laaks through a labyrinth of ravines . Blackened stones , whitened bones : color is gone from the world , Rukuei thought , oblivious to the tilted , fractured strata - ocher and jade and cobalt in the late light of second sundown . Dance is gone , and beauty , and law and music , he thought . Smoke remains , and hunger . Beyond fatigue , Rukuei found one certainty to grip . He was now the eldest male of his sept , and the responsibility for decision was his . Suukmel and the other women and children could go no farther . We will remain with these people until the lady Suukmel is ready to travel again , he 334 Mary Doria Russell thought as his little band trudged the last cha'ar to the strangers ' encampment . It was beyond thinking where they would go then — just as the place they were led to was now beyond seeing . Already blind , he let himself be guided by strong , gentle hands to a place that smelled of unfamiliar bodies . Too tired to eat , he plunged into a sleep so deep it was all but unconsciousness , and did not awaken for many hours . a WHEN HE DID , IT WAS IN SLOW SEQUENCE , EYES LAST : TO THROBBING PAIN in his feet , to the scent of ointment bound to them by clean dressings , to a gabble of languages , to bright daylight filtering through the dirty fabric of a ragged tent . Lying still , he listened to the conversations just outside — a revolting mix of K'San and Ruanja with random elements of commercial Malanja and snatches of court Palkirn’al . The appalling grammar and sloppy diction instantly put him into a foul humor made worse by the frantic morning hunger of a young male who was only beginning to put on the height and muscle of manhood . Already on edge , he was startled by a slight motion to his left and came upright , ready to fight - whom he had no idea , why he could only guess . The world was full of enemies and everything good was gone . But the movement was only a woman 's hand pushing a crudely carved bowl toward him . He stared at it , repulsed by the jellied mess it contained , and then followed the hand to the arm to the face , and blinked when he saw his father 's eyes , alive and amused . The woman was young and visibly pregnant , naked and unveiled . “
160316	160369	160310	160310	You	4254	” she said , and sat back comfortably , at ease on the ground , and unconcerned to be alone in a tent with him . She gave the bowl another little push . He turned his head away , mouth twisting with revulsion , but heard the woman 's voice again . “
160385	160389	160377	160377	You	4254	” she said . “
160402	160425	160426	160426	You	4254	” She spoke in K’San but its precision was polluted by Ruanja 's slurred vowels — a rural domestic 's grating accent . “
160453	160465	160448	160448	you	4254	” He stared at her and , infuriatingly , she smiled . “
160496	160563	160448	160448	you	4254	” He sat up straighter and reached for the bowl , as she knew he would . He was , after all , a normal boy , constantly hungry under the best of circumstances and starving now . He lifted the bowl to his mouth , but reared back from the unfamiliar smell ; then tipped it down his throat in ravenous , almost sobbing gulps . "
160566	160576	160448	160448	you	4254	” she said , pleased as she watched him . “
160589	160603	160583	160583	I	0	” he said , wiping his mouth with the back of his hand . “
160612	160616	160608	160608	you	0	” she advised . “
160634	160658	160628	160628	I	0	” The smell of anger filled the tent , but she did not retract her use of the dominant pronoun in his presence . “
160695	160704	160682	160682	I	0	” She gestured again toward the emptied bowl . “
160711	160717	160682	160682	I	0	” she informed him prosaically , “
160728	160729	160682	160682	I	0	" "
160734	160735	160682	160682	I	0	" “
160745	160766	160737	160737	you	0	" she asked , ears wide , his father 's eyes entertained . He hesitated , but lifted his chin . “
160770	160798	160737	160737	you	0	” she told him . Horrified , his own ears flattened and he nearly vomited , but then he glanced back into those eyes and swallowed hard . "
160801	160806	160808	160808	you	0	” she said again . “
160826	160857	160823	160823	you	0	” She stood and looked down at him , her face a slender version of his own — the Kitheri bloodline visibly governing this generation as it had the last . “
160900	161037	160890	160890	you	0	” And permitting him to think for himself , she turned and left the tent . HE WAS YOUNG AND SOUND , AND HIS FEET HEALED MORE QUICKLY THAN the women 's . Within a day or two , he was able to leave the tent and hobble a little distance up the nearest foothill to a vantage from which he could see the shards and remnants of a civilization . For a few days , solitary a a 336 Mary Doria Russell and silent , he watched the people in this high , chilly valley . Burning with disgrace , writhing at their debasement , he sought out his foster mother , and raged and raged . She listened without comment until he was done , and then gestured for him to sit by her . “
161046	161054	161039	161039	you	4263	” Suukmel Chirot u Vaadai asked serenely . “
161058	161079	161039	161039	you	4263	” Rukuei pulled away from her embrace to gape at her . Suukmel smiled , and drew him close again . “
161121	161138	161139	161140	That person	4267	" Suukmel said this to amuse Rukuei and the absurdity worked , but Taksayu was unbending . "
161152	161163	161145	161145	she	4267	" the Runao sniffed from a nest in the corner . "
161174	161196	161145	161145	she	4267	” Rukuei hardly knew what to think about that extraordinary statement , which did n't prevent him from having an opinion . “
161210	161214	161224	161224	She	4271	” he declared , “
161222	161223	161224	161224	She	4271	” “
161273	161284	161254	161254	she	4271	” Suukmel informed them . Rukuei and Taksayu both stared . “
161317	161318	161309	161309	she	4271	" “
161323	161327	161309	161309	she	4271	" Taksayu cried . “
161331	161332	161335	161335	she	4271	” “
161344	161348	161337	161337	she	4271	” Suukmel continued . “
161369	161370	161360	161360	she	4271	" "
161376	161429	161430	161430	I	0	” Rukuei demanded irritably , the Ruanja word suddenly infuriating him . Of all the differences he had to face among these strangers , the bastardization of language was the most distressing . How can anything make sense if the words you think with are disordered and imprecise ? he cried inwardly . “
161435	161440	161430	161430	I	0	” Suukmel said comfortably . “
161463	161467	161441	161441	Fierno	686	” Rukuei grunted . “
161474	161482	161483	161483	I	0	” Suukmel offered , knowing Rukuei well . “
161510	161550	161505	161505	himself	7187	" а CHILDREN OF GOD 337 She stopped abruptly , rain falling into her heart . The tent suddenly felt cramped and confining , too filled with people , even though she had only Taksayu and Rukuei with her . "
161553	161557	161505	161505	himself	7187	” she said , “
161565	161576	161505	161505	himself	7187	” Taksayu 's ears dropped , and Rukuei looked dubious . “
161579	161595	161505	161505	himself	7187	” Suukmel said then , certain because they doubted both her wisdom and her propriety . “
161606	161607	161598	161598	I	0	" “
161616	161642	161613	161614	MY COUSIN	4276	” RUKUEI ASKED SUUKMEL SEVeral mornings later , as they broke their fast with a strange but not unpleasant pâté provided by the Laaks household . “
161665	161672	161673	161673	Isaac	363	" There was a momentary stiffening . “
161688	161698	161679	161679	he	363	" The change of subject did not go unnoticed . “
161709	161710	161705	161705	I	0	" “
161713	161805	161806	161806	I	0	" Suukmel repeated . She had known this day would come , but had never anticipated that it would be in such circumstances . Pride of lineage was moderated among the unranked children of Hlavin 's harem , but Rukuei knew who his father was , if not what Hlavin had done to reach the paramountcy . Whose disgrace to reveal first ? she asked herself . The father 's or the uncle 's ? There are no innocents in this except the children of dead men : Ha'anala and Rukuei . “
161822	161883	161809	161809	you	4282	" she asked lightly , rising from a badly made cushion that was nonetheless fragrant with mountain moss . She moved to the tent opening , letting her eyes become accustomed to the light , looking up at the colorful shapes that she had initially taken for unusually designed city walls ringing the valley . Rukuei stared up at her . “
161890	161901	161902	161902	I	0	” he asked , getting to his feet as well . “
161922	161930	161931	161931	Shetri	4285	” she said , confirming his suspicions . “
161967	161968	161941	161941	He	4285	" “
161974	162054	161941	161941	He	4285	” Rukuei told her . 338 Mary Doria Russell a They left the tent and began the ascent , taking care with the loose rocks that made the climb a scramble . Suukmel coped with the disorientation by keeping her eyes down , not in submission but to focus on the relatively solid ground nearby . Glancing up every few moments , she tried to estimate the size of things , but she was constantly surprised when she found some "
162056	162094	161941	161941	He	4285	" was only a shrub much nearer than she had thought , or when a bright color she believed to be some far - off person 's cloak suddenly took flight and darted into the thin air . “
162103	162150	161941	161941	He	4285	” she said aloud , as Rukuei showed her how to sit on a fallen tupa 's trunk . As she caught her breath , she looked out over the valley , trying to reconcile what her eyes told her with what she knew was there . “
162185	162186	161941	161941	He	4285	” “
162192	162202	161941	161941	He	4285	” Rukuei finished for her , and settled himself . “
162220	162398	162400	162400	you	4292	" It seemed at first some epic poem of heroes and monsters , of prisons and escapes , of triumph and tragedy . She told of the crushing sameness of unvarying tradition , of a world in which nothing mattered but what had a been decided uncounted generations earlier . And she tried to explain the despair of knowing that nothing could change , the fear that something would : the terror of the unknown and the secret wish for it , in so many hearts . Caught up in this romance , it was a long time before Rukuei realized that the nameless one was Supaari VaGayjur ; that this traitor was his own uncle by marriage , having sired a daughter out of Jholaa Kitheri ; that this daughter was now grown and pregnant with her second child by Shetri Laaks ; that Ha'anala 's eyes were like his own because they shared a grandsire . It was even longer before he could take in what Suukmel told of how Hlavin Kitheri had seized the paramountcy- "
162408	162412	162400	162400	you	4292	" Rukuei cried . “
162415	162423	162424	162424	He	1599	" . all ? His own kin ? "
162445	162452	162453	162453	he	1599	“ I do n't believe you ! "
162464	162473	162453	162453	he	1599	“ This is impossible . He would never have "
162474	162487	162488	162488	she	4295	" He did . He did , beloved ! Try to understand ! ”
162496	162541	162542	162542	she	4295	“ Your father was like lightning in the night - beautiful and dangerous and sudden . They forced it on him ! They were killing him ! They had shut a CHILDREN OF GOD 339 a him up behind walls greater than those mountains , ”
162558	162608	162542	162542	she	4295	“ They had silenced him , and he was dying , Rukuei ! He was dying of the silence ! Think of the music he wrote for you and the other children ! Hear it in your heart ! Know that it would have died in him if he hadn't- "
162720	162723	162724	162724	he	594	" How ? ”
162727	162736	162724	162724	he	594	“ How could it have come to this ? "
162871	162888	162891	162891	her	1105	“ No , do n't try to pick them up ! Just kick the stones along ! ”
162912	162920	162898	162898	Shetri	661	“ Look at Sofi'ala ! Roll them ! ”
162952	162960	162961	162961	Ha'anala	452	“ See how my darling is working ! ”
162971	162978	162979	162979	Outraged	688	“ Good girl , helping others ! ”
163000	163005	163006	163006	he	594	“ You are Kitheri ! ”
163018	163038	163006	163006	he	594	“ How can you degrade yourself this way ? You drag your own child down ! How dare you — ”
163114	163120	163121	163121	Rukuei	594	" We are close kin , ”
163140	163149	163121	163121	Rukuei	594	“ Your dam was my sire 's sister ! ”
163172	163178	163179	163179	he	594	“ My father killed yours , "
163186	163193	163179	163179	he	594	“ twice - twelve days past . ”
163223	163260	163261	163261	he	594	“ Your father did not die alone . The plain of Inbrokar is heaped with dead , and when I last saw him , my father lay next to yours . Killed by such as these ! ”
163278	163300	163261	163261	he	594	“ You speak of choices . So choose , woman ! Who shall die to restore the honor of the dead ? "
163400	163409	163410	163410	she	441	“ My choices are the same as yours , ”
163414	163424	163425	163425	She	441	" Survival or revenge . I choose to live . ”
163448	163483	163484	163484	she	441	“ There are others like you , who choose death . Three days ' walk that way . Ask for my husband 's nephew , Athaansi Erat . They eat well in his camp , ”
163496	163563	163484	163484	she	441	“ Or should I say , they eat plenty . Everything they choose is death . They avenge their losses and pay death with death , and they will die bloody but with full stomachs . You will be welcomed there , cousin . I shall honor the dead by living , and by teaching those who will listen that there is valor in this choice . ”
163611	163617	163618	163618	she	441	“ Our fathers are dead , ”
163625	163638	163618	163618	she	441	“ We are not . Live with me , cousin . Live ... "
163725	163732	163733	163733	he	363	“ I have something to say , ”
163764	163772	163773	163773	He	363	“ Your work is to learn songs . "
163781	163787	163773	163773	He	363	" And to teach them . "
163799	163807	163808	163808	he	363	“ I 'll teach you one someday , ”
163813	163831	163808	163808	he	363	“ It 's not ready yet . You can leave for a while , but come back . ”
163840	163857	163858	163859	Rukuei Kitheri	594	“ I STAYED WITH HA'ANALA AND MY FOSTER MOTHER , SUUKMEL , UNTIL I was fourteen , ”
163867	163988	163862	163863	Emilio Sandoz	261	“ I learned to sing with Isaac , and sometimes he would say the most extraordinary things . I came to trust his ... judgment . He was very strange , but he was right : I was born to learn songs and to teach them . I spent nearly five years wandering through the Garnu mountains — I needed to hear and remember the story of each Jana'ata who had lived through those last days . I hungered for the lullabies and the literature . I wanted to understand the laws and the politics , and the poetry , to preserve some small portion of the intellect and art of a world that had died before my eyes . ' ”
163989	163999	164000	164000	Sandoz	261	“ But eventually you went back to the valley , ”
164003	164009	164000	164000	Sandoz	261	“ To Ha'anala and Isaac ? ”
164010	164013	163862	163863	Emilio Sandoz	261	“ Yes . ”
164014	164031	164000	164000	Sandoz	261	“ And by then , Isaac was ready to let you hear the music he found . ”
164032	164035	164036	164036	Isaac	363	“ Yes . ”
164083	164091	164092	164092	Isaac	363	“ I know why you 're here , ”
164097	164106	164092	164092	Isaac	363	" You came back to learn the song . ”
164110	164116	164092	164092	Isaac	363	“ I found the music . ”
164120	164128	164134	164134	his	363	“ It does n't have words yet . ”
164163	164170	164160	164160	his	363	" What 's wrong , Isaac ? ”
164197	164209	164210	164210	he	363	" The music ca n't be sung unless it has words , ”
164215	164220	164210	164210	he	363	“ Songs have words . "
164249	164258	164259	164259	he	594	“ I 'll find the words , Isaac , ”
164299	164306	164290	164292	Giordano Bruno October	513	“ LOOK AT WHAT THEY'VE DONE , "
164327	164335	164307	164308	JOSEBA URIZARBARRENA	395	“ Look at what they 've done ! ”
164336	164340	164341	164342	John Candotti	378	“ My God , ”
164345	164351	164341	164342	John Candotti	378	“ it 's so beautiful ... "
164352	164355	164356	164356	Joseba	395	“ Beautiful ! ”
164359	164369	164370	164370	he	395	“ How much has died to make this happen ? ”
164424	164433	164434	164434	John	378	“ Joseba , what are you talking about ! ”
164437	164447	164434	164434	John	378	“ It 's gorgeous ! It's — it 's — “
164453	164463	164434	164434	John	378	” Joseba whispered fiercely , shaking with helpless outrage . “
164481	164493	164494	164494	Agriculture	689	" He stood and turned away from the displays , despairing . “
164496	164505	164494	164494	Agriculture	689	” he moaned , face in his hands . “
164512	164513	164514	164514	I	0	" "
164520	164551	164514	164514	I	0	" Nico remarked politely to Sean Fein , who was also leaning against the bridge bulkhead , watching as the system updated and repainted multiple displays , scan by scan . "
164558	164562	164556	164556	Nico	518	" said Sean . "
164567	164731	164556	164556	Nico	518	" First blurred , then emerging from the mist of atmosphere and the fitful 344 Mary Doria Russell a concealment of cloud , becoming clean - edged and brilliant with color , composite images of Rakhat had revealed upon the arrival of the Giordano Bruno in lowering orbit a world transformed : raw Paradise made formal garden . The change was most extensive in the midlatitudes of the northern hemisphere , where the largest continent 's southern cities — first identified by Jimmy Quinn and George Edwards and Marc Robichaux forty years earlier - embraced coast and river . Superimposing old and new images , it was still possible to discern the outlines of urban centers . But now , where untouched savannah or jungle or fen or montane forest once lay , there was instead an exquisite lacework of plantation — colossal parterres laid out in interlocking knotted designs like Celtic jewelry : husbandry , geometry , artistry on a grand scale . “
164737	164755	164556	164556	Nico	518	” Sean Fein recited quietly , remembering a twelfthcentury scholar 's description of the Book of Kells , “
164808	164809	164810	164810	They	4353	” “
164821	164827	164810	164810	They	4353	” Frans Vanderhelst said prosaically . “
164843	164844	164832	164832	you	4350	" "
164847	164851	164832	164832	you	4350	" said Carlo . “
164867	164891	164948	164948	you	261	" He leaned forward over Frans 's vast shoulder and traced a curving line of mountain that formed a template for exuberant terracing . "
164903	164935	164948	164948	you	261	" He turned to Sandoz , tucked into a corner of the bridge , oblivious to the visuals , concentrating on the radio chatter . Carlo waved to draw his attention . “
164951	164990	164948	164948	you	261	" Carlo asked him when he 'd pulled the earphones off . Sandoz stood with a groaning stretch before joining Danny , Sean and Nico against the wall , where they could take in the bank of screens . "
164993	164999	164948	164948	you	261	” he said , stunned . “
165016	165039	165000	165001	The Jana'ata	290	" He stared for a time , watching as sea quential images added resolution and brought out finer detail in composite frames . "
165046	165055	165000	165001	The Jana'ata	290	" Joseba went to a false color display . “
165070	165085	165086	165086	My	0	” He brought up an overlay with comparison data from the Stella Maris library . “
165106	165113	165145	165145	you	4355	” a a CHILDREN OF GOD 345 “
165118	165129	165145	165145	you	4355	” said Danny , doing the estimate in his head . “
165163	165164	165145	165145	you	4355	" “
165169	165173	165145	165145	you	4355	” Carlo said . “
165187	165221	165145	165145	you	4355	” Following the terrain , he noticed . Not like the Romans ' roads — ramming straight through from point A to point Bbut roads nonetheless . Good for business , he thought . “
165229	165239	165145	165145	you	4355	” he asked Sandoz . Emilio shook his head . “
165266	165274	165275	165275	I	0	” he said with a shuddering yawn . “
165290	165291	165145	165145	you	4355	” “
165296	165302	165145	165145	you	4355	” Danny Iron Horse asked . “
165307	165537	165145	165145	you	4355	” Emilio confirmed as he left the bridge . He was doing nearly all the translation work now , but Danny had the more difficult task . There were decades of transmissions relayed from Rakhat to the Magellan to Earth , samples of which were routed back to the Bruno ; those had to be reconciled with what the Bruno had intercepted from the Magellan while in transit and what they could hear directly now . Emilio 's mind went white amid the tangle of time sequences , but Danny seemed able to cope with it . There were big shifts in content signaled by vocabulary that Emilio had never heard and could only guess at — and , of course , they were only getting scraps and partials . Even so , for a time the samples had featured a heartening mixture of languages , song and news , and he had begun to think that perhaps something really had changed for the better . He did n't know what to make of the absence of K'San now , any more than he understood what the acceptance of agriculture implied , so he left Joseba and Danny 's growing argument about industrial development behind , and headed to the galley for coffee . He was pouring it when , behind him , John cleared his throat in warning . “

167272	167327	167254	167254	Sandoz	261	" Dammed emotion crashed through barriers they had both believed insuperable until that moment , but the sobbing was soon leavened with laughter and chagrined apologies and finally with what was clearly joy , and they began to argue , as though no time had gone by , over who had started crying first . “

It 's safe , but I do n't get around too well anymore and finding your way through the garden mazes is impossible unless you 're a Runao—. Listen to me ! I 've lived with the Runa too long !

170404	170432	170400	170400	I	0	" Ha'anala demanded , her voice mixing with the kha'ani shrieks , and coming muffled to Suukmel under her protective cov- 356 Mary Doria Russell a ering . “

170595	170682	170588	170588	you	545	" Suukmel pointed out , emerging from her tarp . An outraged kha'an launched a flying counterattack and Suukmel took a swipe at it before shouldering her basket and hurrying a few paces away to a patch of grass . The little brutes were vigilantly territorial , but could n't see very well . We all have our weaknesses , Suukmel thought , commiserating with her prey 's parents . She sat in the rare sunshine , warming herself , and took out a few eggsaks . "
170691	170822	170689	170689	child	1094	" she called to Ha'anala . Haʼanala stood for a time , making an easy target for the kha'ani , but finally lugged her basket over and dropped it next to Suukmel , who serenely kneaded an eggsak until its contents were well mixed . It had taken her some time , but she had worked out a way to manage these things neatly . You had to be deft . Compress the tough , fibrous outer covering in one hand to make the sak taut , and force a claw from the other hand into one end . Then suck out the contents quickly while being careful not to put too much pressure on the sak . Squeeze too hard and you 'd have albumin all over your face . "

170952	170978	170941	170941	She	4448	” Suukmel agreed . Ha'anala lowered herself to the ground , making a tripod of her legs and tail , belly swelling out before her . “
170999	171003	170981	170981	she	4448	” Haʼanala cried . “
171026	171057	171059	171059	Shetri	4448	" Suukmel put out a hand and gently pulled Ha'anala over until she lay down , head in Suukmel 's lap , wrapping her tail around herself like an infant . “

171339	171344	171346	171346	they	4464	” Suukmel said gently , “
171352	171376	171346	171346	they	4464	” Ha'anala glared down at the N'Jarr , where lean women bore fewer children every year , no matter whom they mated with . "
171388	171393	171394	171394	Athaansi	662	” she declared recklessly . “
171400	171401	171394	171394	Athaansi	662	" “
171404	171473	171394	171394	Athaansi	662	” Suukmel said , watching Haʼanala 's gallantry fade . There had been no births during the past year , and few before that . Sofi'ala was a sturdy child who looked likely to survive childhood , but Haʼanala » 358 Mary Doria Russell a had lost a spindly toddler to the lung blight Shetri 's herbs could not stave off , and had borne another son dead . “
171479	171486	171475	171475	Athaansi	662	” Ha'anala said , almost soundlessly . “
171492	171499	171475	171475	Athaansi	662	” Suukmel pointed out with wonderment , “
171514	171515	171508	171508	Runa	429	” "
171518	171522	171508	171508	Runa	429	" Ha'anala cried . “
171537	171538	171508	171508	Runa	429	” “
171542	171551	171508	171508	Runa	429	” Suukmel said , handing Ha'anala another eggsak . “
171562	171593	171508	171508	Runa	429	” But Haʼanala simply let her hand fall listlessly , too distracted and dismayed to be heartened by a day when dense northern clouds parted around thin , silvery light . “
171599	171604	171605	171607	my lord husband	7187	” Suukmel told her , “
171644	171674	171629	171630	The Paramount	367	” Haʼanala stood and walked to the edge of the rocks , the breeze riffling through her fur . Suukmel stood then herself and walked to Ha'anala 's side . “
171766	171811	171812	171812	I	0	” Suukmel looked out over the sweep of the valley , dotted now with small stone houses and filled with the sound of voices high and low , home to Runa and to Jana'ata and to the single outlandish being whom Haʼanala called brother . “
171895	171899	172013	172013	Rukuei	594	” she said . “
171919	172012	172013	172013	Rukuei	594	” Ha'anala dropped to her knees and put her hands to the rock , to hold herself up . The keening was soft at first , but they were alone on this hillside , far from those whose faith could be undermined by a leader 's failure of nerve . Now was as good a time as any to give in to tiredness and worry ; to hunger and responsibility ; to yearning for lost parents and mourning for lost children , and for all that might have been and was n't . “
172017	172039	172013	172013	Rukuei	594	” Haʼanala said finally in a tiny voice , face pressed CHILDREN OF GOD 359 » now into Suukmel 's belly . “

172074	172079	172071	172072	my heart	4485	” Suukmel advised serenely . “

172126	172146	172147	172147	Our	4487	” Ha'anala asked , alone and frightened . Suukmel did not answer for a while . Finally she said , “

172189	172194	172169	172169	YOU	4491	” Kajpin VaMasna agreed , “
172204	172259	172260	172260	I	0	” She listened to the wrangling for a while and then lay back to watch the clouds roll over the valley . It had been a long time since Kajpin herself had required agreement before making a decision — a character flaw she was no longer embarrassed by . She looked over at Tiyat . “
172274	172434	172260	172260	I	0	” Tiyat gazed affectionately at her companion . A former soldier , sickened by killing , Kajpin VaMasna had come north by herself , and since then had helped to ease the lives of VaN'Jarri of both species by raiding Runa trade caravans . Tiyat was just a domestic in the old days . She 'd held a position of trust and responsibility even then , but she still sometimes hid in the middle of the herd , and admired Kajpin , who did not abase herself but still got along with everybody . When the news about the new foreigners spread through the community , it was Kajpin who suggested that she and Tiyat should go south and bring a human back to the N'Jarr , touching off the fierno that still raging . Most of the Runa had gotten bored and gone off to find something to eat , but the Jana'ata showed no signs of consensus . “
172437	172442	172260	172260	I	0	” Rukuei was saying , “
172475	172479	172473	172473	myself	0	” he admitted . “

172518	172540	172498	172498	We	4494	" Ha'anala demanded , trying to ignore Isaac 's humming , which was getting louder and more insistent by the moment . “
172546	172562	172498	172498	We	4494	” a was 360 • Mary Doria Russell Tiyat spoke up for the first time . “
172571	172617	172568	172568	Someone	1080	” She stopped , shy but ashamed of taking cover , especially on this point . Tiyat loved the music Isaac had found ; it was the only kind of music she had ever been able to listen to , and it had changed her . “
172635	172636	172629	172629	They	5747	” "
172637	172657	172658	172658	Suukmel	545	“ And there may be ways they can be useful to us — as honest brokers , for example , ”
172672	172687	172658	172658	Suukmel	545	“ They could go back to the south and open negotiations on our behalf- ( “
172689	172691	172658	172658	Suukmel	545	” ) “
172709	172713	172714	172714	Sofia	356	” Haʼanala objected . “
172734	172735	172722	172722	They	5747	” “
172743	172760	172736	172736	They	5747	” Shetri said , glancing at his collection of narcotics . Ears toppling , Ha'anala cried , “
172770	172772	172736	172736	They	5747	” ( "
172774	172776	172777	172777	I	0	" ) “
172786	172794	172777	172777	I	0	” Rukuei said over Isaac 's noise . “

172824	172836	172837	172837	Rukuei	594	” Shetri said , with a slight edge to his voice , “
172862	172874	172879	172879	Shetri	661	” Ha'anala looked up sharply , but refused to be sidetracked . “
172881	172886	172879	172879	Shetri	661	” she said flatly . “
172903	172905	172899	172899	Kajpin	701	" ( "

172924	172936	172899	172899	Kajpin	701	” Tiyat pointed out , mild eyes sweeping around the gathering . “
172943	172962	172899	172899	Kajpin	701	” she said again , then three are better yet , so we should go get a foreigner . "
172964	172967	172899	172899	Kajpin	701	“ Uuuuuuuuuuuuunnnnnnhh — ”
173006	173023	173024	173024	she	4506	“ Just keep your mouths shut and your boots on and your hands in your sleeves , ”
173030	173049	173024	173024	she	4506	“ If you 're exposed , then Tiyat and I are constables bringing in a couple of VaHaptaa . ”
173054	173064	173065	173065	Tiyat	702	“ Kajpin can lie as well as a poet , "
173081	173091	173092	173092	Suukmel	545	" What goes wrong can be turned to advantage , ”

173283	173308	173273	173273	he	363	" SHETRI , I THINK , MIGHT HAVE MANAGED TO MAINTAIN HIS ANONYMITY , but there was something unmistakably Jana'ata about my foster son , "
173309	173326	173273	173273	he	363	" Suukmel told Sean Fein many years later , recalling Rukuei 's account of that journey . “
173398	173522	173523	173523	He	4524	” Some Runa the party encountered took the opportunity to fling stones at a safely vanquished enemy , or to shout abuse . Still others let fly random kicks that Tiyat and Kajpin fended off with casual efficiency but no great emotional heat that would give the deception away . Before they reached the northernmost navigable tributary of the Pon river and had taken a short - term lease on a private powerboat , Rukuei had tasted the salt of his own blood from a broken tooth . But there was an old man , a Runao , who followed the four of them for a long time . Curious , they decided to wait for him one morning . 362 Mary Doria Russell "
173537	173541	173523	173523	He	4524	” Suukmel remembered . “
173549	173550	173542	173542	Rukuei	594	” "
173556	173563	173551	173551	Someone	1080	" the old man had said . "
173580	173586	173587	173587	Someone	1080	” this Runao begged Tiyat . “
173598	173633	173587	173587	Someone	1080	” Tiyat looked at Kajpin , and they both turned to Rukuei , who had not eaten Runa for years . Kajpin 's hand shot out and pushed Rukuei theatrically forward along the road . “
173636	173646	173587	173587	Someone	1080	” Tiyat agreed loudly , dismissing the old one . “
173652	173670	173648	173649	the djanada	1066	" But Rukuei felt it would uncover no lie if he called out to the old man , “
173677	173685	173675	173675	you	4532	offering—"and stumbled again as Shetri cuffed him . “
173694	173699	173688	173689	genuine allies	4533	” Suukmel told Sean . "
173779	173780	173757	173759	My foster son	4242	" “
173820	173825	173814	173814	You	1460	” Sean told her . “
173837	173886	173827	173827	they	4541	” The Jana'ata are alone , Sean thought then , like godlings whose believe ers had become atheists . In his own soul , he knew with sudden certainty that it was not rebellion or doubt or even sin that broke God 's heart ; it was indifference . “
173892	173897	173827	173827	they	4541	” he warned Suukmel . “
173948	173949	173904	173904	They	4541	" "
173957	173961	173904	173904	They	4541	” Suukmel whispered . “
173964	173970	173904	173904	They	4541	” this hard man said . “
173973	173974	173904	173904	They	4541	” “
173988	173992	173985	173985	you	1460	" she demanded . “
173998	174045	173985	173985	you	1460	" Perhaps , he almost said . But then Sean remembered his father , eyes shining with the unadulterated glee that Maura Fein had loved and shared , shaking his head at some ignominious example of the human capacity for boneheaded , self - inflicted calamity . “
174052	174066	174048	174048	Sean	390	” David Fein CHILDREN OF GOD 363 sense would say to his son , “
174081	174153	174154	174154	My	0	” Sean Fein gazed for a time at the pale northern sky , and thought of the place where his own ancestors had lived . He was a Jesuit and celibate , an only child : the last of his line . Looking at Suukmel 's drawn , gray face , he felt at long last compassion for the fools who expected fairness and in this world , not the next . “
174173	174178	174165	174171	the daughter of petty kings long gone	4552	” he told Suukmel . “

174262	174268	174269	174269	Suukmel	545	“ And so might we , ”
174276	174285	174286	174286	Sean	390	“ Shit , yes , y’might at that , ”
174307	174315	174316	174316	he	390	“ My very much esteemed lady Suukmel , ”
174325	174347	174316	174316	he	390	“ one thing I can say for certain . There 's just no telling whom God will take a liking to . ”

Which is why the first man from the Giordano Bruno to set foot on Rakhat was not Daniel Iron Horse , who was the mission 's superior , or Joseba Urizarbarrena , an ecologist aching for his first glimpse of this new world ; not Emilio Sandoz , who knew the place and would react most quickly to danger , or John Candotti , determined to be at his side , in case disaster struck again ; nor was it the would - be conquistador Carlo Giuliani or his bodyguard Niccolo d'Angeli . It was Father Sean Fein , of the Society of Jesus , who pushed his way to the front of the queue and exited the lander the moment the hatch opened , stumbling forward a few steps and falling gracelessly to his knees , where he threw up for a good two minutes . They might have hoped for a more auspicious beginning to their stay . . Sean at least managed to arrange for the first words spoken by a member of their mission to be a kind of prayer . “
174847	174856	174844	174845	Dear God	711	” he gasped , when things slowed down , "

174919	174955	174915	174915	I	0	” Emilio Sandoz whispered , walking as they all did now away from the lander 's ticking - hot hull , away from the stench of burnt fuel and vomit , into the redolent wind . “
174960	175186	174956	174956	I	0	” They 'd meant to come earlier , just after the first of Rakhat 's suns had risen , before the steaming heat of full day , but the weather was more than usually unstable this time of year and storms had delayed landfall twice . Finally , Frans had identified a break in the rains and Carlo had decided to go down , even though it would be close to second sunset when they landed . So they had by accident arrived on Rakhat at the most beautiful time of day , when the late afternoon chorale of wildlife announced its existence to an unheeding world intoxicated with its own luxuriance . To the east , the far landscape was veiled by sheets of gray rain , but there were two suns low behind them , just above the white limestone escarpment that helped contain the Pon river , and these lit up the near country brilliantly , making an immoderate world sparkle like a pirate 's jewel box : all diamond a 366 Mary Doria Russell a raindrops and golden clouds , its wanton foliage amethyst and aquamarine and emerald , its extravagant blossom citrine and ruby and sapphire and topaz . The very sky flared like opal : yellow and pink and mauve , and the azure of the Virgin 's robes . “
175192	175202	174956	174956	I	0	" John asked Emilio , standing next to him . “
175206	175305	174956	174956	I	0	" Joseba cried , agriculture 's depredations forgotten in the languourous panorama of lavender savannah . There was a lifetime 's work within a few paces of where he stood . The soil alive with tiny vertebrate fauna , the air teeming with flying things , membranous wings flashing as they wheeled in the sunlight . Overwhelmed by the sheer volume of data , Joseba could hardly keep himself from staking out a square meter and beginning the research that very moment ; he needed to contain it somehow - divide it , tame it , know it . “
175313	175317	174956	174956	I	0	” said Nico . “
175326	175334	174956	174956	I	0	” said John , searching for words . “

175382	175432	175377	175377	they	4565	" Emilio looked around and then walked to a patch of low - growing bushes a few paces away . He picked a trumpet - shaped blossom , its petals the hallucinatory scarlet of a poppy , and held it out to John , who leaned forward to inhale . “
175447	175465	175466	175466	Yasapa	712	” John asked , offering the blossom to Sean , who backed away , still feeling rocky . “
175468	175472	175466	175466	Yasapa	712	” said Emilio . “
175477	175491	175492	175492	You	4566	" John pulled the pieces apart . Ya s ap a . . . "
175499	175531	175492	175492	You	4566	" he translated triumphantly . Pleased with his pupil , the linguist nodded as Carlo reached for the flower , carrying it with both hands to his face and inhaling deeply . “
175559	175563	175565	175565	they	4567	” Emilio said , “

175601	175606	175584	175584	You	4566	” Carlo crowed triumphantly . “
175626	175636	175617	175617	you	4566	” he told Sandoz , looking at the blossom . “
175640	175649	175617	175617	you	4566	" He paused , and then sneezed violently . "
175654	175665	175617	175617	you	4566	" Nico intoned . Carlo nodded , and tried again , “
175669	175700	175617	175617	you	4566	th—"He stopped , mouth a CHILDREN OF GOD 367 open , eyes closing , and this time there was a series of sneezes , with Nico blessing each small detonation . “

175724	175734	175735	175735	God	654	" he finally managed to ask before sneezing again . “
175737	175741	175735	175735	God	654	” he cried , “

175777	175795	175742	175742	I	0	” Danny suggested . Carlo shook his head in amazement , and managed to continue his thought . “

175823	175837	175816	175817	the Jebs	384	” Danny warned as Carlo abandoned himself to an artillery barrage of sneezing . “
175873	175886	175866	175867	the Benedictines	4571	” Carlo was now staggering backward , as though jet - propelled . “
175892	175916	175866	175867	the Benedictines	4571	” he gasped with his hands over his mouth , which felt bizarrely numb . His eyes were starting to itch and water . “
175921	175927	175866	175867	the Benedictines	4571	” he heard Sean say . "
175935	175957	175866	175867	the Benedictines	4571	" Sandoz ordered . And Carlo did so , but the sneezing continued unabated , and his eyes were swelling shut ... “
175973	175978	175979	175979	Sean	390	” John was griping . “

175996	176014	175990	175990	Padrone	713	” Nico asked . When there was no answer , Nico turned to Emilio and asked again , “
176020	176030	175990	175990	Padrone	713	" Everything began happening at once : Emilio yelling , “
176046	176082	176041	176041	He	284	” Carlo hitting the ground , each breath a separate struggle to suck air past a rapidly constricting pharynx . Danny dashing back to the lander for the ana kit . Emilio barking at John , “
176092	176152	176153	176153	Danny	385	” Then Carlo turned blue and Nico 's fright turned to sobs . Sean tried to calm him , but Emilio turned away from the grief , arms across his chest , and paced for a few moments before glancing back to see Joseba take over the rhythmic effort to restart Carlo 's heart when John began to flag . “
176158	176180	176153	176153	Danny	385	” Emilio yelled as Iron Horse skidded to a halt and dropped to his knees next to Carlo 's lifeless body . “
176185	176204	176153	176153	Danny	385	” Emilio said , his voice low and tense as he watched Iron Horse dig through the kit . “
176221	176261	176262	176262	Jesus	259	” But even as he spoke , Carlo 's color pinked and the gasping breaths started to come again without Joseba 's aid . Suspended in time , they all watched silently as the hit of epinephrine took hold . “
176264	176268	176262	176262	Jesus	259	” John whispered . “
176273	176280	176269	176269	He	284	” a a 368 Mary Doria Russell “
176284	176293	176262	176262	Jesus	259	” Emilio said , coming to life himself , “
176311	176312	176313	176313	Nico	518	" “
176315	176320	176262	176262	Jesus	259	" Sean said evenly , “
176338	176375	176330	176331	Don Carlo	526	” Bleary - eyed and scared but always ready to obey a direct order , Nico ran a ahead to open the cargo - bay door while John , Sean and Joseba carried Carlo to shelter . “
176387	176399	176330	176331	Don Carlo	526	” Emilio was telling Danny as they dogtrotted behind the others . “
176412	176436	176330	176331	Don Carlo	526	" By the time they had the lander systems reactivated and the filters began cleaning the interior air , Carlo was coming around . “
176453	176465	176330	176331	Don Carlo	526	” he could hear Joseba point out . But Sandoz said , “
176486	176528	176330	176331	Don Carlo	526	” Throat still constricted and eyes puffed shut , Carlo struggled to sit up ; someone took him under the arms and pulled him to his feet , maneuvering him into a flight seat . Drained and disoriented , he whispered , “
176534	176535	176330	176331	Don Carlo	526	” “
176540	176570	176330	176331	Don Carlo	526	” he heard Sandoz agree . He could not see the man , but Carlo could picture the head shaking in wonder , silver hair falling over black eyes . “
176587	176592	176593	176593	yours	4580	” Sandoz told him , “
176614	176615	176611	176611	you	4580	” "
176623	176661	176662	176662	Your	0	” Carlo tried to smile and was startled by how odd his swollen face felt . I must look like Frans , he thought as his vision cleared and breathing became easier . Then it struck him : "
176679	176680	176667	176667	You	261	” “
176699	176704	176705	176705	I	0	” said Sandoz dryly . “
176730	176731	176732	176732	Sandoz	261	” "
176742	176748	176749	176749	Emilio	261	“ To die of anaphylaxis , ”
176754	176817	176749	176749	Emilio	261	“ which is exactly what you did a short while ago . Yasapa blooms year - round . You can try the surface again later , if you like — maybe John can reconfigure a pressure suit for you . For now , I recommend that you return to the mother ship . The deci- . sion is yours , of course . ”
176818	176821	176823	176823	Carlo	526	“ Right , ”
176835	176874	176875	176875	he	526	“ Radio the change of plans to Signora Mendes and put Frans on remote as backup » > a CHILDREN OF GOD 369 pilot . Do you suppose yasapa brandy would affect people as the blossom did me ? ”
176878	176907	176875	176875	he	526	“ We 'll have to put warning labels on anything we exportdrink at your own risk . That will probably increase the appeal ! An element of danger — "
176908	176917	176918	176918	Danny	385	“ You 'll still get sued , ace , ”
176922	176972	176918	176918	Danny	385	" I 'm going to move you to the cockpit . We need to reopen the cargo bay , but you should be okay if you 're sealed off , up front . As soon as we get the gear unloaded , you 're going back to the Bruno . "
177102	177108	177109	177110	Shetri Laaks	661	" Sti 's feet dancing , "
177125	177139	177109	177110	Shetri Laaks	661	" What a stench ! Those people must be dead in the nose . ”
177140	177149	177150	177150	Kajpin	701	“ Why did they go back so soon ? ”
177153	177168	177150	177150	Kajpin	701	“ I thought their plans were to wait here for the escort from Gayjur . ”
177169	177176	177177	177177	Tiyat	702	“ Now what shall we do ? "
177180	177184	177177	177177	Tiyat	702	“ Go back to ”
177185	177188	177189	177189	Rukuei	594	“ Quiet ! ”
177199	177202	177189	177189	Rukuei	594	“ Listen ! "
177242	177248	177249	177249	Rukuei	594	“ There ! Hear it ? ”
177252	177259	177249	177249	Rukuei	594	“ They have n't all gone ! "
177260	177264	177265	177265	Tiyat	702	“ They sing ! ”
177268	177274	177265	177265	Tiyat	702	“ Isaac will be pleased . ”
177275	177283	177284	177284	Shetri	661	“ Sipaj , Kajpin , tie off , ”
177288	177302	177284	177284	Shetri	661	“ We 're upwind ! Rukuei , can they taste scent at all ? ”
177303	177327	177328	177328	He	594	“ Not so well as we , but they 're not oblivious . Perhaps we should circle around to get downwind of them . ”
177336	177342	177328	177328	He	594	“ Or wait until morning . ”
177380	177388	177389	177389	Tiyat	702	“ The water 's warm down here ! ”
177412	177419	177420	177420	Kajpin	701	" You two monitor the radio , ”
177426	177439	177424	177424	Shetri	661	“ We 'll go up and see what we can find out . "
177452	177459	177448	177448	Tiyat	702	“ There are three of them ! ”
177460	177467	177468	177468	Kajpin	701	“ Go sit in the boat ! ”
177482	177498	177476	177476	her	4599	“ There 're four ! See ? There 's a child sitting by that shelter . ”
177499	177503	177504	177504	Shetri	661	“ A translator ? ”
177514	177528	177529	177529	Rukuei	594	“ No , they do n't bring children to learn to be interpreters , ”
177534	177551	177552	177552	He	594	“ At least , they did n't last time . Some of their adults are small . "
177573	177588	177529	177529	Rukuei	594	“ That 's the one for Isaac . Can you see who 's singing ? "
177595	177614	177615	177615	Tiyat	702	" Sipaj , Kajpin , did your grandmother screw djanada ? You 're the one who 's blind ! ”
177618	177656	177615	177615	Tiyat	702	“ It 's the one doing the cooking . Watch the mouths ! The others are just jabbering . The cook — do you see ? His mouth stays open longer , while the song comes out . ”
177685	177700	177701	177701	he	594	“ One of their party got sick , so they took him back up , ”
177709	177721	177701	177701	he	594	“ The others are still waiting for an escort to Gayjur . ”
177722	177740	177741	177741	Kajpin	701	" So . There are three adults and one child — or whatever that little one is , "
177756	177801	177741	177741	Kajpin	701	“ There 's black rain east of here , but the VaGayjuri could show up any time , once the weather clears . I say we wait for the foreigners to fall asleep tonight , take the singer for Isaac , and go home . ”
177802	177809	177810	177810	Tiyat	702	“ The others will wake up ! "
177813	177829	177810	177810	Tiyat	702	“ Isaac can see at night , you know . They 're not like djanada . ”
177830	177846	177741	177741	Kajpin	701	“ Then grab all four ! They do n't look like much for a fight , ”
177847	177850	177851	177851	Rukuei	594	“ No , "
177855	177872	177851	177851	Rukuei	594	“ Ha'anala was right — you do n't make allies by sneaking up and grabbing people . ”
177873	177880	177881	177881	Shetri	661	“ Just invite them to breakfast ! ”
177885	177898	177899	177899	he	661	“ Sipaj , foreigners , such a long journey you 've had ! ”
177913	177920	177899	177899	he	661	“ Wo n't you join us ? ”
177944	177954	177955	177955	he	661	“ Roast some betrin root - Isaac likes betrin , ”
177963	177985	177955	177955	he	661	“ Mix a few grains of othrat into the seasoning , and they 'll sleep all the way to the N'Jarr ! "
177986	177992	177993	177993	Rukuei	594	“ Listen to that song , ”
178010	178013	177955	177955	he	661	" L'elisir d'amore ”
178021	178031	178032	178032	Rukuei	594	“ Sipaj , Tiyat , what do you think ? ”
178035	178039	178032	178032	Rukuei	594	“ Any ideas ? ”

178088	178095	178096	178096	I	0	” CARLO INSISTED THREE DAYS LATER , “
178110	178111	178112	178112	They	4605	” "
178117	178148	178112	178112	They	4605	" Sofia repeated , cutting Carlo off . Her voice was clear and hard , despite the huge storm system over Gayjur , which made her transmission pop and hiss . “
178179	178180	178218	178218	ace	1870	” “
178186	178200	178218	178218	ace	1870	” John Candotti whispered , hugging himself and pacing along the bridge bulkhead . “

178220	178249	178218	178218	ace	1870	” said Danny , but like everyone else , he was reconsidering the facts . Three days of terrible weather , with short reports from the ground crew : "
178254	178259	178260	178260	Signora	714	" But no details ... "
178270	178304	178260	178260	Signora	714	” Carlo said , having taken this step to avoid the fate of the lost Contact Consortium party . He watched as Frans Vanderhelst brought up the readouts from the global positioning system . “
178322	178323	178260	178260	Signora	714	” “
178329	178337	178338	178338	Signora	714	” Frans said . Carlo swore briefly . “
178398	178399	178481	178481	Signora	714	" "
178406	178411	178481	178481	Signora	714	" Sofia asked tightly . “
178416	178449	178414	178414	Sandoz	261	” Frans reported . 372 Mary Doria Russell There was a moan from John and something near a growl from Sofia Mendes . Carlo cut in , still studying the GPS data . “
178463	178464	178454	178454	Sandoz	261	” "
178479	178480	178481	178481	Signora	714	” “

178523	178524	178492	178492	you	0	” “
178530	178554	178492	178492	you	0	” Frans said defensively . He was already pulling up the transcripts to see if there was something he missed , some clue ... “
178559	178560	178561	178561	Signora	714	” “
178571	178595	178565	178565	You	714	” Carlo cried . He was hardly one to dither , but Mendes seemed to leap out ahead of everything that was said . “
178604	178605	178596	178598	The ground party	2236	" "

178655	178656	178657	178657	Signora	714	" “
178664	178665	178657	178657	Signora	714	” “

178703	178713	178694	178697	One of my men	4622	" Carlo said , trying to slow her down . “
178735	178736	178729	178729	Nico	518	” "
178744	178749	178729	178729	Nico	518	" Sofia reminded him . “
178782	178808	178841	178841	God	716	” she said almost to herself , her anger like the thunderheads in Gayjur 's sky , whose lightning made the radio crackle and spit . “
178907	178959	178960	178960	Visitors	1775	” 35 Pon River Drainage October 2078 , Earth - Relative EMILIO SANDOZ WAS THE FIRST TO NOTICE THE TRAVELERS APPROACHing the campsite on foot from the west . All four VaRakhati wore the robes and boots of urban Runa traders , and he had no reason to doubt their identity . “
178962	179055	178960	178960	Visitors	1775	” he announced , and walked out to meet the newcomers , Nico at his side , Sean and Joseba behind him . He was not afraid . Sofia had assured him repeatedly that there were no djanada south of the Garnu mountains , and Nico was armed . He held out both his hands , palms upward in the Runa manner , and readied himself for the once - familiar warmth of the long Runa fingers that would rest in his own , then remembered the braces and lowered his arms . "
179072	179083	179066	179066	someone	1080	” he explained . Glancing at Nico , he urged , “
179087	179099	179066	179066	someone	1080	” and watched , pleased , as Nico 's grave and correct greeting—"Challalla
179100	179127	179133	179133	women	1252	khaeri”—was ac- . knowledged and returned by the two Runa who came forward . Turning to Sean and Joseba , he smiled at their dumbstruck immobility . “
179135	179140	179133	179133	women	1252	” Emilio told them . “
179163	179181	179133	179133	women	1252	” When the greetings had been exchanged , he continued as though he had never been away , “
179201	179310	179190	179190	We	4643	" He saw the two people in the back look at each other , and it was then > 374 Mary Doria Russell 9 that he stopped breathing , and stared at the smaller of them . Not a Runao , but someone Emilio Sandoz had seen in all too many nightmares : a man of medium stature , with violet eyes of surpassing beauty that met and held his own with a gaze so direct and searching that it took all his strength to stare back , and give no ground . It ca n't be , he thought . This can not be the same man . “
179323	179343	179320	179321	Emilio Sandoz	261	" he heard the man ask . The voice was different . Resonant , and beautiful , but different . “
179356	179397	179320	179321	Emilio Sandoz	261	" At the sound of the K’San language and the sight of the Jana'ata 's carnassial teeth , revealed as Rukuei had spoken , Sean backed away . Nico drew his weapon , but Joseba stepped up swiftly and said , “
179403	179515	179320	179321	Emilio Sandoz	261	" He flicked off the safety and with a Basque hunter 's reactions , turned and fired at something snuffling piglike in the bushes nearby . The gunshot and death squeal set off an explosion of reaction among the wildlife , and the VaRakhati staggered back , eyes wide and ears clamped shut . Joseba handed the pistol back to Nico , who trained it on the Jana'ata who 'd spoken , but kept an eye on all of them — now frozen and visibly frightened . Walking to the carcass in the ensuing silence , Joseba bent and lifted the body by one leg , letting its blood drip educationally . “
179524	179529	179516	179516	We	4646	" he said firmly . “
179539	179540	179532	179532	we	4646	” “
179544	179561	179532	179532	we	4646	” said Emilio . He was breathing hard , but Carlo was right : bullets worked . “
179569	179577	179564	179565	no one	5227	" he said , staring at Rukuei . “
179607	179624	179625	179625	My	0	" There were gestures of assent from all four VaRakhati . Dazed , Rukuei said vaguely , “
179630	179637	179638	179638	Sandoz	261	“ In a manner of speaking , ”
179642	179650	179651	179651	he	261	“ How are you to be addressed ? ”
179666	179675	179651	179651	he	261	“ Are you first - born or second ? "
179697	179718	179694	179694	he	0	“ I am freeborn . My mother was not a woman of standing . If you please : Rukuei Kitheri . ”
179719	179723	179724	179725	Sean Fein	390	“ Christ Almighty , ”
179728	179731	179724	179725	Sean Fein	390	“ Kitheri ? "
179732	179740	179741	179741	Sandoz	261	" You are son to Hlavin Kitheri ? "
179770	179780	179781	179781	Sandoz	261	“ You lie . Or you are a bastard , ”
179812	179825	179806	179806	Nico	518	“ That Kitheri was Reshtar , and had no right to breed . ”
179864	179870	179857	179857	himself	4657	“ I am Shetri Laaks . ”
179910	179968	179887	179887	his	661	“ Rukuei is my wife 's cousin and I must not tolerate offense to my affinal kin . He has not lied , nor is he a bastard , but the song of his birth would take long to sing . I believe our purposes will be better served if none of us indulges in further insult . ”
179983	179988	179989	179989	he	261	“ I grant parity , ”
179999	180005	180006	180006	he	261	" You speak of purpose , ”
180020	180028	180029	180029	he	594	“ I know why you came here , ”
180045	180053	180029	180029	he	594	“ You came to learn our songs . ”

180124	180163	180164	180164	he	261	“ We came because we believed you sang of truth , and of the Mind behind truth . We wished to learn what beauties this True Mind had revealed to you . But you sang of nothing beautiful , ”
180170	180196	180164	180164	he	261	“ Your songs were of the pleasure to be found in unmerciful power , the satisfaction of crushing opposition , the enjoyment of irresistible force . ”

180228	180245	180217	180217	she	1078	" Now it is the southern Runa who enjoy such power . We VaN'Jarri are different . ”
180246	180260	180261	180261	Rukuei	594	“ We have one among us who has learned the music you sought — "

180301	180304	180305	180305	Sandoz	261	“ Isaac , "
180308	180325	180305	180305	Sandoz	261	“ Isaac is a foreign name . Is the person you speak of one of us ? "
180326	180329	180331	180331	Shetri	661	“ Yes , ”
180333	180352	180331	180331	Shetri	661	“ He is of your species , but he is not like his mother , nor like his sister "
180359	180363	180364	180364	Sandoz	261	“ His sister ! "
180367	180388	180389	180389	Shetri	661	" His sister , my wife , whose name is Ha'anala and whose foster mother was Sofia Mendes u Ku'in , "

180455	180460	180439	180439	Supaari	286	” Sean was muttering . “
180471	180477	180464	180464	Isaac	363	” he demanded in K'San . “
180499	180511	180493	180493	you	4665	" Not waiting for the answer , Joseba said in English , “
180529	180530	180524	180524	they	4671	" "
180533	180545	180531	180531	Hostage	3878	” Kajpin cried , startling them with her knowledge of English . "

180560	180564	180565	180565	Nico	518	” Rukuei began . “
180567	180572	180565	180565	Nico	518	" Sandoz said quietly , “
180578	180613	180615	180615	me	0	” Before anyone else could move , Rukuei Kitheri had been slammed to the ground and was choking wide - eyed on the gun that Nico had jammed into his mouth with professional efficiency . "
180631	180644	180620	180620	you	594	” Sandoz suggested , dropping to his knees to whisper his threat . “
180660	180661	180657	180657	him	2301	” “
180664	180676	180657	180657	him	2301	” Rukuei said , the taste of steel in his mouth . “
180685	180707	180708	180708	Rukuei	594	“ If there are more , I will have you and them killed — you last . Do you believe me ? "
180722	180745	180708	180708	Rukuei	594	“ I say you hold the foreigner Isaac against his will . I say you use him as your father used me . "
180746	180752	180753	180753	Tiyat	702	“ These people are crazy ! ”
180768	180787	180765	180765	Sandoz	261	“ I will hear this man 's words ! Speak , Kitheri : is the foreigner Isaac alive ? "
180788	180801	180803	180803	Rukuei	594	" Yes ! Isaac is a person of honor among the VaN’Jarri , ”
180814	180848	180803	180803	Rukuei	594	" He left the southern Runa many years ago of his own volition . He is free to go or stay . He chooses to stay among us . He likes our songs — ”
180849	180866	180867	180867	Kajpin	701	“ Sipaj , Sandoz , we could have taken you hostage last night as you slept ! ”
180884	180904	180803	180803	Rukuei	594	“ It was Rukuei 's idea to be honest with you ! The escort from Gayjur will be here soon "
180905	180912	180913	180913	Sean	390	" How do you know that ? "
180921	180968	180917	180917	Kajpin	701	“ It is we - but - not - you who are in danger ! We are no threat to you . We need you , , and we have something to offer in return , but if we 're captured , we 'll be executed ! ”
180990	181052	181053	181053	He	4661	“ The last three times the VaN’Jarri tried to make contact with the government in Gayjur , our delegates were killed on sight . Please . Listen to me . We wish an agreement with the southerners , but the VaGayjuri will not negotiate with us because my nephew Athaansi keeps raiding Runa villages , and we are all held responsible ! ”
181060	181099	181058	181058	himself	4661	“ Hear me , Sandoz . I will stand surety . If we lie , if we deceive you in any way , then have me killed as that froyil was killed . I will be your hostage . ”
181100	181105	181106	181106	Kajpin	701	" We as well , ”
181113	181121	181123	181124	Rukuei Kitheri	594	“ I also offer you my neck , ”
181130	181192	181123	181124	Rukuei Kitheri	594	“ But you will have to go to Isaac , for he will not come to you . We can take you to him , but you have to trust us . Some of us believe that Isaac has learned the music of the True Mind , which you sought , but he will not come to you to teach it . "
181193	181196	181197	181197	Sandoz	261	“ Lies , "
181202	181211	181197	181197	Sandoz	261	“ You say what we wish to hear — "
181212	181223	181224	181224	Tiyat	702	“ How could we know what you wish to hear ? ”
181251	181258	181259	181259	he	261	“ Let him up , Nico , ”
181286	181290	181291	181291	he	261	“ Watch them , "
181338	181352	181353	181353	Shetri	661	“ It would be a shame to let that froyil go to waste , "
181471	181486	181487	181487	he	261	“ Nico , why are n't you watching them , as you were told ? ”
181501	181520	181521	181521	Nico	518	“ They do n't want to run away . They 're waiting for us to go with them , ”
181525	181548	181521	181521	Nico	518	“ Don Emilio , I had a thought : if we find out where Isaac lives , Signora Sofia will be pleased . ”
181569	181578	181579	181579	he	261	“ Don Carlo will know where we are , ”
181598	181608	181579	181579	he	261	“ We have guns , and they do n't . ”
181609	181627	181628	181628	Sandoz	261	" We 're not going anywhere with them . We 're waiting here for Sofia 's escort , "
181645	181666	181637	181637	Joseba	395	“ Nico , would you please get Don Emilio some water ? Perhaps a little something very plain to eat ? ”
181683	181705	181706	181706	he	261	“ Sandoz , do you have any idea what the population of the Jana’ata was , when you were here before ! ”
181726	181759	181760	181760	He	261	" No . I do n't know . Except that it was about three or four percent of the prey population . Maybe six hundred thousand ? That 's just a guess . "
181765	181771	181760	181760	He	261	“ Why do you ask ? "
181785	181810	181779	181779	Sean	390	“ Listen , Sandoz , the buggers may be lying , but that Rukuei says there 're only about fifteen hundred Jana'ata left now . ”
181820	181887	181816	181816	Sean	390	“ The Runa’ve rousted them all off the land . They 're scattered , but there 're two main groups of several hundred apiece , plus some pockets of survivors too scared t’go near anyone else . The VaN'Jarri live in a valley on their own . They 've got barely three hundred Jana’ata among them , with about six hundred Runa in the same settlement . ”
181892	181934	181935	181935	he	395	“ Carnivores generally need at least two thousand individuals , with two hundred and fifty breeding pairs , just to keep the population genetically healthy . Even if Rukuei is underestimating the total , the Jana'ata are very close to extinction , ”
181952	181964	181935	181935	he	395	“ If he 's overestimating it , they 're probably doomed . ”
181975	182026	181965	181965	He	395	" It makes sense , Sandoz . From what we 've seen and what Shetri says , the Jana'ata must be living at the absolute margins of their ecologiCHILDREN OF GOD 379 a cal range . Even without the collapse of civilization , this species would be on the edge . "
182027	182032	182033	182033	Sean	390	“ There 's more , "
182048	182106	182033	182033	Sean	390	“ There 's something goin' on up in the north . I had t'ask twice t'be sure of what I was hearin ' , but when we asked about them eatin ' that froyil , one of them — that Shetri — told us the VaN'Jarri Jana'ata are near t'starvin ' . They wo n't eat Runa . ”
182116	182132	182107	182107	Sandoz	261	“ Brace yersalf : the phrase he used was , The meat 's not kosher . ”
182143	182179	182180	182180	Joseba	395	“ I swear that 's what he said . Apparently this man Shetri 's wife , Hanala or whatever her name is , was raised by Sofia Mendes in the south , among the Runa . "
182183	182249	182180	182180	Joseba	395	“ Obviously , there has been a certain amount of cultural exchange . Shetri says his wife is a teacher , but Sandoz — the title he used was ‘ rabbi ’ . It 's possible that these men are simply lying about not eating Runa , but look at them ! They 're thin , their coats are dull , they 're missing teeth — "
182250	182277	182278	182278	Sean	390	“ And they 're travelin ' with two fine , fat Runa , who do n't seem a bit concerned about becomin ' anybody 's breakfast . ”
182284	182289	182290	182290	he	390	“ And , Sandoz , ”
182293	182336	182290	182290	he	390	“ listenin ' t'this Kitheri ? Well , it seems to me that Hanala may be a sort of ... I do n't know , but I ask myself , What if Moses had been an Egyptian , raised among the Hebrews ? "
182349	182354	182355	182355	he	261	“ You 're serious ? ”
182366	182374	182363	182363	Sandoz	261	" Oh , for God 's sake ! "
182375	182378	182379	182379	Joseba	395	" Precisely , ”
182395	182405	182406	182406	Sandoz	261	" You 're hearing what you want to hear ! "
182409	182420	182406	182406	Sandoz	261	“ You 're imposing your own folklore on this culture ! "
182421	182426	182427	182427	Joseba	395	" Perhaps we are , ”
182437	182507	182431	182431	his	395	“ but I came here as both an ecologist and a priest . I want to know about this . I am going north with them , Sandoz . Sean wants to go , too . You can stay here with Nico and wait for Sofia 's people to arrive . All we ask is that you do n't give them away . We 'll take our chances with them ”
182555	182571	182572	182572	he	518	“ Don Emilio , one of those Jana people has a bad dream like yours , "
182594	182611	182591	182591	Nico	518	“ He dreams of a city burning . He told me . It 's from when he "
182648	182885	182639	182639	I	0	” WHICH IS WHY , AFTER CONSIDERABLE ADDITIONAL INTERROGATION AND discussion , eight people of three species finally went north together in secrecy and foul weather . They did not tell Carlo Giuliani of their decision , concerned that the radio was being monitored by the Gayjur government . Knowing now the danger the VaN’Jarri were in , it was Joseba 's suggestion that they remove their GPS implants — a small cut each , nothing to be concerned about . They intended to travel as quickly and inconspicuously as they could , but if anyone questioned them , their story would be simple . The foreigners were friends to Fia . Shetri and Rukuei were VaHaptaa mercenaries who were leading these Runa and the foreigners to the last stronghold of the predators who 'd preyed on the Runa since time began . When the place was known , the army could come and clean the last of the djanada out , and then they would be gone , forever . The VaN’Jarri believed that this was all merely a convincing lie . In fact , it was very nearly the precise truth . Nico d'Angeli had not really understood what Joseba said about minimum breeding population and species collapse , nor had he followed much of the talk of revolution or religion . But Nico understood very well what Frans had told him before landfall . “

183552	183561	183544	183544	Sandoz	261	“ Someone could ask Nico to stop singing . "

183572	183583	183585	183585	Tiyat	702	" It 's not as beautiful as Isaac 's music , "

184775	184778	184764	184764	he	418	“ Fack . ”
184831	184834	184835	184835	he	418	“ Apologies , ”
184845	184851	184835	184835	he	418	“ I acted in haste . "
184852	184858	184859	184859	Sean	390	“ Go on without us , ”
184865	184913	184859	184859	Sean	390	“ We 'll go back and CHILDREN OF GOD 385 a meet the escort . It 's us they 're concerned about . Soon as they know we 're all right , they 'll relax . We can figure out how to get to the N’Jarr later — "
184914	184923	184924	184924	Sandoz	261	“ How much farther is it to Inbrokar ? "
184929	184944	184926	184926	Rukuei	594	“ We could be there by second sunrise today , if we move fast . ”
184945	184953	184954	184954	Sandoz	261	" It takes time to mobilize troops , "
184957	184991	184954	184954	Sandoz	261	“ We 're three days away from the rendezvous site , and it will be farther for them , because they 'll have to come overland the whole way , wo n't they ? "
184992	185008	185009	185009	Kajpin	701	“ No , they can use troop barges , but that 's slow , too , ”
185017	185038	185012	185012	Tiyat	702	“ They do n't need the troops — there'll be militia alerted all over the country . We 're cooked . ”
185039	185044	185045	185045	Nico	518	“ I 'm sorry , ”
185049	185098	185045	185045	Nico	518	“ But — what if we told Signora Sofia that we 'll bring back her son ? We tell her , Do n't follow us . If you do , the deal is off . You cooperate , your boy comes back to you , no harm done . "
185110	185115	185116	185116	Sandoz	261	“ It might work , ”
185165	185176	185147	185147	he	261	" We make her an offer she ca n't refuse . "
185217	185255	185195	185195	Emilio	261	“ Do n't ask , okay ? Just do n't ask . I 'm going the extra mile , John . I ca n't tell you more than that . Have Frans put me through to Sofia . ”
185302	185309	185310	185310	he	261	" You 're right , Sofia , ”
185313	185327	185310	185310	he	261	“ Absolutely . But we are not under duress - Listen to me ! "
185348	185351	185352	185352	he	261	“ Sofia , ”
185357	185425	185352	185352	he	261	“ I have to do this . There is something I have to see for myself . All I 'm asking is that you give me some time to work this through — a couple of weeks , maybe . Please . I never asked you for anything before , Sofia . Just this one thing , okay ? Give me a chance to see for myself ... "
185475	185484	185485	185485	he	261	“ Sofia , you leave me no choice , ”
185492	185542	185485	185485	he	261	“ I believe I can locate Isaac and bring him back to you , but only on the condition that we are not followed . That 's the deal , Mendes . Back off , and I 'll do what I can to bring your son home to you . "
185660	185666	185667	185667	Rukuei	594	" Can you smell it ? "
185671	185674	185675	185675	Emilio	261	" No , "
185678	185682	185675	185675	Emilio	261	“ Not yet . ”
185693	185701	185702	185702	he	261	“ Yes . I smell it now , ”
185724	185728	185729	185729	Sandoz	261	“ Wait here , "
185746	185751	185752	185752	Rukuei	594	" I was twelve , ”
185768	185805	185752	185752	Rukuei	594	“ The war was as old as I was . Thirty thousand men died here in a single day , and then a city full of refugees . Within another year or two — a civilization . ”
185834	185855	185856	185856	Sandoz	261	"'Their blood has been shed like water , round about Jerusalem , and there was none to bury them , ' ”

185905	185913	185898	185898	he	261	“ When did they start wearing armor ? "
185914	185922	185923	185923	Rukuei	594	" Toward the end of the war , "
185926	185944	185947	185947	him	594	“ I 've heard it said : Choose your enemies wisely , for you will become them , "

186110	186132	186088	186088	Rukuei	594	" So , in some ways , it seemed acceptable that so many died in the fires , after the battle . ”
186271	186276	186247	186247	Nico	518	“ Una furtiva lagrima . ”
186366	186379	186380	186380	Rukuei	594	“ What I remember most clearly is my small sister 's voice , ”
186388	186421	186380	186380	Rukuei	594	“ All the Paramount 's freeborn children were in the embassy — he must have known how it would end , but hoped that there would be perhaps some respect for diplomats . ”
186437	186473	186422	186422	Rukuei	594	" My sister was somewhere in the fire . As we ran from the city , I could hear her call my name . A silver wire of sound : Ru - ku - eiiiii ... "
186599	186603	186604	186604	Sandoz	261	" Tell me , "
186620	186629	186630	186630	Shetri	661	“ He does n't mean to hurt me , ”
186633	186664	186630	186630	Shetri	661	“ How can he know ? Rukuei thinks children are hope , but they 're not ! They 're terror . A child is a limb that can be torn from you—"Shetri
186682	186686	186687	186687	Sandoz	261	“ Tell me , ”
186699	186764	186765	186765	he	261	“ My wife is pregnant , and I fear for her . The Kitheris are small , and Haʼanala nearly died during the last birth — the baby was large in the hindquarters , like a Laaks . Ha'anala hides a great deal . This pregnancy has been very hard . I fear for her , and for the baby . And for myself , ”
186768	186816	186765	186765	he	261	" Sandoz , shall I tell you what my daughter Sofi'ala asked me when she learned her mother was pregnant again ? She asked , Will this baby die , too ? She has lost two younger brothers . She expects babies to die . So do I. ”
186831	186840	186842	186842	Shetri	661	“ I was once an adept of Sti , ”
186844	186933	186842	186842	Shetri	661	“ I was third - born , and content . Sometimes I long for the time when there was nothing in my life but still water , and the chants . But six must sing together , and I think the others are all dead now , and there is no one who can be spared to learn the ritual . I once believed myself fortunate to become a father but now—. It is an awful thing to love a so much . When my first son died ... "
186934	186942	186943	186943	Sandoz	261	“ I am sorry for your losses , "
186952	186960	186943	186943	Sandoz	261	" When is the new baby due ? "
186961	186986	186987	186987	He	261	“ In a few days , perhaps . Who can tell with women ? Maybe it 's come already . Maybe it 's over . ”
186990	187002	187003	187003	He	261	“ My first son died of a disease of the lungs . ”
187013	187018	187003	187003	He	261	“ But the second — ”
187023	187027	187029	187030	the foreigner	1405	“ Tell me , ”
187033	187091	187029	187030	the foreigner	1405	" The priests of Sti are known — were known for our medicines , our knowledge of how to heal wounds and help the body overcome illness when it was fitting to do so . I could not stand to watch Haʼanala die , so I tried to help her . There are drugs to ease pain ... ”
187102	187113	187114	187114	he	261	“ It was my fault that the child was stillborn , ”
187119	187127	187114	187114	he	261	“ I only wanted to help Ha'anala . ”
187128	187145	187146	187146	Sandoz	261	" I , too , watched a child dear to me die . I killed her , "

187196	187206	187207	187207	I	0	” Shetri said with a soft grunt of commiseration . “
187211	187245	187246	187246	Shetri	661	” They listened for a time , waiting for the low rumble of thunder to reach them . When the foreigner spoke again , his voice was soft but clear in the darkness . “
187282	187283	187277	187277	you	661	" "
187326	187336	187316	187316	Sandoz	261	” Shetri cried , too desperate to be ashamed . “
187450	187456	187483	187483	you	0	" Nico was singing now : “
187461	187470	187471	187471	Shetri	0	” the notes lifting on the night breeze . "
187486	187490	187483	187483	you	0	" Sandoz said . “

187523	187530	187512	187512	I	0	” There was a long silence . “
187534	187540	187512	187512	I	0	" Sandoz said at last . “
187562	187563	187555	187555	Shetri	661	” “
187569	187587	187567	187567	FRANS	533	" EMILIO SAID THE NEXT DAY , AS THOUGH nothing much had occurred since his last transmission . “
187604	187617	187618	187618	Emilio	261	” There was a slight delay before John 's voice was heard . “
187631	187632	187628	187628	you	261	" "
187647	187652	187635	187635	John	378	” Emilio said lightly . “

187688	187694	187686	187686	ace	1870	” said Danny Iron Horse . “
187707	187712	187700	187700	I	0	” Carlo cut in . “

187763	187773	187752	187752	I	0	” Sandoz said , ignoring the sounds of irritation . “
187855	187856	187850	187850	Joseba	395	” "
187863	187868	187850	187850	Joseba	395	” Danny asked suspiciously . “
187929	187943	187944	187944	He	395	” He waited for the clamor on the Giordano Bruno to die down . "
187987	187991	187992	187992	Sandoz	261	” Frans said , “
188006	188007	188008	188008	You	261	" "
188022	188026	188017	188017	We	4791	” Emilio cautioned . "
188044	188045	188049	188049	you	0	” “
188052	188061	188049	188049	you	0	" Carlo asked , self - mockery plain . “
188092	188093	188082	188082	You	261	” “
188099	188158	188082	188082	You	261	” Emilio warned him with a small laugh , and they made arrangements for the landing . 3 37 N’Jarr Valley October 2078 , Earth - Relative Ha'ANALA HAD TWO DREAMS THAT NIGHT . HER THIRD CHILD — THE unnamed stillbirth — appeared at the doorway , small and fetal but cheerful , his face full of mischief . “
188164	188172	188161	188161	you	261	” Ha'anala cried when she saw him . “
188186	188196	188197	188197	You	261	" she scolded affectionately , and the baby answered , “
188204	188302	188197	188197	You	261	” She roused briefly , with a sensation of tightness across her belly , but the risit from her dream son was reassuring and she drifted back to the heavy sleep that had characterized this pregnancy . The second dream was also of a dead child but , this time , she relived the last few minutes of Urkinal 's life and awoke with a start , the hiss and rattle of his tiny lungs in her ears . Suukmel , who had moved in with her while Shetri was gone , came awake in an instant . “
188307	188318	188197	188197	You	261	" she asked quietly in the thin light of dawn . "
188321	188325	188197	188197	You	261	" Haʼanala whispered . “
188331	188385	188326	188326	I	0	” She sat up with a graceless a lurch but as carefully as she could , not wanting to wake Sofi’ala , sleeping in the nest beside her . Another gray day , she noted , peering out through cracks in the stonework . There was no sound yet from the other houses . “
188395	188396	188386	188387	The children	5443	” “
188405	188443	188397	188397	Someone	1080	” Suukmel said , smiling at the superstition . a 392 Mary Doria Russell a But Ha'anala shuddered , as much from the chill of the sunless morning as from the memory of a small rattling chest . “
188461	188462	188452	188452	Ma	544	" “
188467	188481	188452	188452	Ma	544	” Suukmel said , getting to her feet and beginning the morning chores . “
188545	188546	188533	188533	I	0	" “
188558	188629	188632	188632	Shetri	661	” Ha'anala shifted her position and rested her back against her husband 's rolled - up sleeping nest . She felt vaguely uneasy , despite the fact that they 'd received good news directly from Shetri , via the Bruno . He and the others were well and would be arriving today , with the foreigners , in an extraordinary craft that could bring them home quickly and without detection . “
188650	188686	188645	188645	I	0	” She stopped , face still . At last ! she thought , welcoming the wave of cramp , rolling from top to bottom . When she raised her eyes , Suukmel was watching knowingly . “
188694	188709	188690	188691	anyone else	1547	" Ha'anala said , glancing significantly at Sofi'ala , who was beginning to stir . “
188718	188719	188710	188710	I	0	” "
188724	188744	188720	188720	I	0	” Sofi'ala whined , eyes still closed . It was the inevitable morning greeting , this time of year . “
188754	188803	188745	188746	Your father	1768	” Suukmel told the child gaily , and smiled a little sadly when the child 's glorious lavender eyes snapped open at that news . They could hear other households awakening nearby , and the first wisps of smoke from Runa dung fires were beginning to reach them . “
188829	188830	188814	188814	you	0	" "
188832	188868	188869	188869	Sipaj	311	" Haʼanala called as Sofi'ala ran out to join the other children , who spent their mornings dashing around the village , peering into pots , hunting for the most abundant or tastiest meal available . “
188879	188889	188890	188890	She	687	" Suukmel chuckled at that , but Ha'anala insisted , "
188910	188911	188903	188903	she	687	” “
188918	188923	188912	188912	You	0	” Suukmel told her . “
188943	188944	188936	188936	her	687	" “
188958	188964	188936	188936	her	687	” said Haʼanala in riposte . “
188973	188979	188936	188936	her	687	” CHILDREN OF GOD 393 a “
188993	188997	188998	188998	They	3149	” Suukmel parried . “
189003	189031	188998	188998	They	3149	” They spent the morning jousting like this , enjoying the mental combat , but the tempo and strength of the contractions were constantly on their minds . “
189041	189066	189032	189032	They	3149	” Ha'anala said , when all three suns were up , the brightest a flat , white disk burning through the cloud cover overhead . “
189070	189279	189032	189032	They	3149	” Suukmel said , but she , too , was concerned , watching with some dismay as Ha'anala curled up in her nest and fell silent . By that time , Haʼanala 's daughter had worked out what was going on , and Suukmel turned her attention to reassuring the child and greeting the guests who began to gather , alerted by Sofi'ala 's anxious wail . Though the Jana'ata considerately withdrew after conveying their good wishes , the house was soon crowded with Runa , who brought enthusiasm and encouragement and food for the assemblage , along with the warmth of their bodies and of their affection . Like the Runa , Ha'anala believed a birth was an occasion for festivity and seemed happy for the distraction , so Suukmel did not drive the visitors off . If the contractions did not quicken , they did at least increase in intensity and Ha'anala welcomed that , despite the pain . In the midst of an endless discussion of what might hurry the labor along , a boy ran in with news of the lander and soon they all heard its horrifying noise , the room emptying abruptly as the crowd moved off to witness this astonishing arrival . "
189288	189293	189032	189032	They	3149	" Ha'anala told Suukmel . “
189312	189313	189310	189310	Shetri	661	” "
189320	189337	189310	189310	Shetri	661	” Suukmel teased as she left for the landing site at the edge of the valley . “
189343	189414	189415	189415	Someone	1080	” Alone at last , Ha'anala rested as best she could , surprised by how tired she was so early in this labor . She listened as the roar of the engines abruptly ceased , heard the buzz of conversation indistinct in the distance . Days seemed to pass before Shetri came to her ; despite all she wanted to ask him , the only words she spoke aloud were , “
189419	189571	189415	189415	Someone	1080	” Shetri went to the door and shouted for help . Soon Ha'anala was lifted to her feet and , though she stopped and squatted now and then , hit by another contraction , she was able to walk slowly to a place where game in miraculous quantity was spitted and roasting over smoky fires . Smiling at the spontaneous carnival that had erupted , her eyes sought out the foreigners in the crowd . One was close in size to Sofia , the others as tall as Isaac , but with none of his wandlike slenderness . Dark and light ; bearded 394 Mary Doria Russell and hairless and maned . And the languages ! High K San and peasant Ruanja and H'inglish — as hilariously mixed in the confusion of the cooking and greetings and stories as Ha'anala 's own speech had been when she 'd first met Shetri . “
189577	189587	189310	189310	Shetri	661	" she cried , to no one in particular . “
189594	189683	189684	189684	I	0	" Cheered by warmth and the prospect of rapprochement with the south , Ha'anala knelt heavily , bearing down with a will , certain that this was the moment when the new child should be brought into light and laughter . She felt instead a tearing pain that made her scream and silenced the others , so that only the hiss of fire and the distant warbling of a p’rkra could be heard . When she could breathe again , she laughed a little and assured everyone wryly , “
189691	189711	189684	189684	I	0	" Slowly the merriment and conversation resumed , but she could smell Shetri 's anxiety and this worried her . “
189718	189853	189684	189684	I	0	" she commanded affectionately , but he was frightened and made an excuse to help the foreigners distribute meat , sending Rukuei to sit behind her like a Runa husband . Suukmel came as well , and Tiyat , with her youngest riding her back . Content to have her cousin 's arms around her shoulders , Ha'anala leaned back against his belly , his legs drawn up around her own , his cheek resting near hers , and listened as Rukuei sang of his adventure in a spontaneous poem with the rocking rhythm of a steady walk . She was genuinely interested in the story , and drifted along , buoyed by the tale , laughing when Rukuei made comedy out of the fright he had been given by the little foreigner Sandoz . "
189861	189959	189854	189855	Small individuals	4819	” Ha'anala observed breathlessly , leaning over to press her lively belly between her chest and legs , glad that she could summon up a little humor even now . Hearing his name , Sandoz had joined them , making an obeisance rather than offering his hands . When the introductions were over , he sat where he too could watch the party : silent , hunched and rocking slightly , his arms crossed over his chest . His posture very nearly mimicked her own during a contraction , and Haʼanala 's first words to him were , “
189968	189983	189962	189962	you	4820	” He stared and then hooted , startled by the remark but apparently amused . “
190000	190036	190037	190037	My	0	” he replied , and if she did n't understand all of his words , she liked his smile . He had eyes like Sofia's — brown and small — but warm , not stony . “
190046	190054	190055	190055	Ruanja	309	” he asked . CHILDREN OF GOD 395 “
190063	190064	190037	190037	My	0	” “
190068	190072	190037	190037	My	0	” he observed . “
190079	190092	190037	190037	My	0	” Ha'anala continued , pausing as the wave crested and then receded . “
190097	190129	190037	190037	My	0	” For a time , the five of them watched Runa tending fires and roasting a sticks of root vegetables now that the Jana'ata had been able to eat their fill . “
190136	190158	190130	190130	We	4823	” Suukmel said , smiling at Tiyat and then reaching out to grasp first Rukuei 's ankle and then Ha'anala 's . “
190163	190167	190130	190130	We	4823	" Sandoz asked . “
190171	190185	190037	190037	My	0	” Suukmel considered him for a time and decided he was being ironic . “
190188	190201	190037	190037	My	0	” she agreed easily , then swept an arm across the panorama . “
190212	190213	190214	190214	Someone	1080	” “
190223	190243	190214	190214	Someone	1080	" said Tiyat . She looked down at her sleeping son , and then at the people surrounding Ha'anala . "
190251	190252	190253	190253	Sandoz	261	" “
190263	190292	190253	190253	Sandoz	261	” Ha'anala said , in the language of politics . He motioned toward the one with the bare skull first and answered her in the language of affection . “
190345	190355	190338	190338	He	734	” He paused , and switched a to K'San . “
190364	190365	190356	190356	I	0	” "
190372	190392	190356	190356	I	0	" Ha'anala asked , glancing at Suukmel , who was also listening carefully . The answer was in Hebrew . "
190406	190428	190398	190398	He	734	” Sandoz paused , looking at the others , and realized that only Ha'anala spoke Hebrew . In K'San he said , “
190456	190468	190451	190451	he	734	” He gestured then toward Joseba , and simplified the name . “
190487	190488	190480	190480	Hozei	678	” “
190496	190521	190522	190522	Dani	728	" Suukmel asked , when Ha'anala was silenced by another contraction . Sandoz drew in a chestful of air and let it out slowly . “
190524	190538	190522	190522	Dani	728	” he said , and they waited to hear which language he selected . “
190547	190553	190554	190554	He	4832	" he said in K'San . “
190595	190600	190580	190580	he	4832	" 396 Mary Doria Russell "
190606	190610	190580	190580	he	4832	" Suukmel remarked . “
190613	190617	190618	190622	The one who is singing	4836	" Sandoz agreed . “
190624	190628	190618	190622	The one who is singing	4836	" Ha'anala asked . “
190646	190654	190658	190659	a poet	2781	" Sandoz smiled and continued in Ruanja . “
190677	190688	190672	190672	his	4832	” He glanced at Tiyat and chose his words carefully . “
190708	190718	190719	190719	Nico	518	” He paused as the three Jana'ata exchanged looks . “
190742	190747	190735	190735	he	518	” Sandoz told them . “
190794	190795	190797	190797	you	0	” “
190801	190805	190797	190797	you	0	” Rukuei asked . “
190812	190851	190797	190797	you	0	" He did not answer because Ha'anala closed her eyes , folding over her belly , and this time , gave a strangled cry that brought Shetri to her side . When her breath returned , she said , "
190862	191076	190857	190857	I	0	" » AS THE LIGHT FADED , SO DID THE PAINS , WHICH SEEMED NOW TO BE AT some distance . Her attention flickered like the fire that warmed her and lit up the night , but she continued to listen to the quiet conversation around her , marveling at Sandoz 's voice , so unlike Isaac's - not loud and halting but soft and musical , its pitch rising and falling , its cadences varied and flowing . Ha'anala had forgotten that humans could speak that way , and she was saddened by the years that had passed since she had last heard Sofia 's voice . Swept by mourning , she grieved for the past , and also for the future she would not know , for there came a private moment when she knew that she would die — not with the unfocused theoretical understanding that she was mortal but with the physical certainty that death would come for her sooner rather than later . To her surprise , she slept , waking briefly with each gripping muscular wave , aware that she drew on a diminishing reserve of strength each time she rejoined the living . Once she came fully alert in the darkness , and told the others , “
191089	191100	190857	190857	I	0	” Soothing murmurs succeeded shocked silence , but she said , “
191118	191185	191188	191188	I	0	" This said , she sank back into oblivion . CHILDREN OF GOD 397 a At dawn , her husband 's snarl brought her back to the world . She was in the house now but warm , covered with blankets the likes of which she 'd never seen . Without moving , she could look out the door to a ghostly landscape softened by fog . “
191194	191199	191188	191188	I	0	” Shetri was insisting . “
191210	191211	191202	191202	you	0	" “
191218	191237	191213	191213	you	0	" she heard a foreigner demand , his harsh accusatory whisper carrying easily in the still dawn air . “
191247	191248	191245	191245	man	1173	" “
191251	191264	191245	191245	man	1173	” Shetri cried , turning away from Shaan , ears clamped shut . “
191272	191298	191265	191265	I	0	" Closing her eyes , Ha'anala listened to Rukuei explain why she had to die , his words coming to her in scraps and tatters . “
191336	191351	191332	191332	Hozei	678	“ This is not a thing of abnormality but weakness brought on by hunger ! "
191352	191367	191368	191368	Sandoz	261	“ Shetri , I think you are right and that Ha'anala will die soon , ”
191372	191479	191368	191368	Sandoz	261	“ I think Shaan is wrong . The procedure he wishes to try will kill Ha'anala . None of us is an adept — we do n't know how to do this in a way that will preserve the mother 's life , and I think Ha'anala is too weak now to survive it . I am sorry . I am so very sorry . But - among us , when this happens , the child sometimes lives for a very short time after the mother dies . Please — please , if you will permit it , perhaps we can at least save the child . ”
191480	191483	191484	191484	Ha'anala	452	“ How ? "
191491	191499	191484	191484	Ha'anala	452	“ How do you save the child ? "
191537	191576	191517	191517	he	4661	“ Sipaj , Ha'anala , someone thinks that after you are gone , for a few moments , the child will live on . It would be necessary to cut open your body and lift the child out . ”
191577	191580	191581	191581	Shetri	661	“ Desecration , ”
191596	191621	191581	191581	Shetri	661	“ No , no , no ! If—. I do n't want the child ! Not now , not this way ! Ha'anala , please ”
191622	191628	191629	191629	she	452	“ Save what you can , ”
191632	191643	191629	191629	she	452	“ Hear me , Shetri . Save what you can ! ”
191688	191694	191695	191695	she	452	" Get out , Shetri , ”
191718	191727	191695	191695	she	452	“ All of you : leave me alone ! "
191746	191750	191751	191751	she	452	" Not you , ”
191754	191757	191751	191751	she	452	“ Stay . ”
191781	191787	191770	191770	she	452	“ Save what you can . "
192026	192035	192038	192038	him	261	“ Someone likes the sound of your voice , ”
192043	192048	192038	192038	him	261	" Talk to me . "
192052	192053	192038	192038	him	261	" “
192073	192107	192108	192108	Celestina	516	” So he told her about Gina , and Celestina , and they fell silent for a while , first smiling about rowdy little girls , then waiting for another contraction to pass . “
192114	192122	192167	192167	Ha'anala	452	” Haʼanala said when it was over . “
192126	192127	192167	192167	Ha'anala	452	” "
192159	192164	192165	192165	Sipaj	311	” he told her . “
192176	192177	192165	192165	Sipaj	311	” “
192195	192214	192188	192188	Sofia	356	” a CHILDREN OF GOD 399 a a When he hesitated , she opened her eyes and said , “
192243	192331	192235	192235	you	452	" He was ashamed to have failed her , and Sofia , but found himself describing La Perla and his childhood friends , losing himself in old passions and simple beauties : the solid smack of a ball into a worn glove , the swift arc into second base , a whirling throw to first for a double play . She understood very little but knew the joy of motion , and told him so in short , breathless phrases . He helped her take more water . “
192336	192343	192235	192235	you	452	" she said when she could . "
192350	192384	192346	192346	Nico	518	” Nico did , sitting in shafted light : arias , Neapolitan love songs , hymns he 'd learned at the orphanage . Soothed , her thirst slaked , Ha'anala said once more , “
192392	192630	192346	192346	Nico	518	” She slept ; Nico sang on . Tired himself , Emilio dozed off , and awoke to a song that was surely the most beautiful he had ever heard . German , he thought , but he knew only a few of the words . It did n't matter , he realized , transfixed and at peace . The melody was everything : supple and serene , rising like a soul in flight , obeying some hidden law ... All around them , the VaN’Jarri listened as well , children clinging to parents , everyone aware that the time was very near . Opening his eyes , Emilio Sandoz saw the last fall of the chest , drew back the blankets and studied the abdomen ; saw the faint movement and thought , Still alive , still alive . Nico , wide - eyed , handed him the knife . As though from a great distance , Sandoz watched his own unfeeling hands cut quickly and decisively . For hours , he had feared this moment , afraid that he would cut too deeply or too hesitantly . In the event , there was a kind of wordless grace . He felt purified , stripped of all other purpose as this body opened up beneath him , layer after layer , blossoming , glistening like a red rose at dawn , its petals bathed in dew . “
192633	192643	192644	192644	Nico	518	" he said softly , and slit the caul . “
192651	192752	192644	192644	Nico	518	” The big man did as he was told , swarthy face paling in the shadowy hut at the awful sound — sucking and wet - as he pulled the child free . He stood then , thick - fingered hands supporting the infant 's fragile form as though it were made of glass . John stood just beyond the door , ready to clean the baby and take it to the father , but when he saw what Nico carried , the steam rising wispily from its fine , damp fur , he threw back his head and cried , “
192755	192799	192644	192644	Nico	518	" Nico a 400 Mary Doria Russell a burst into tears , and there was a great howl from the others that fell away when Sandoz lurched like a madman through the doorway and whispered in direct address , in denial and defiance , "
192808	192967	192644	192644	Nico	518	" Abruptly he snatched the child away from Nico and dropped to the ground with it , supporting his weight on his knees and his forearms , the tiny body so close he could feel the lingering warmth of its mother 's corpse . With his mouth , he sucked the slimy membrane and fluid from the nostrils and spat , enraged and resolved . Tipping the damp head back with one ruined hand , holding the blunt little muzzle closed with the other , he put his mouth over the nose again : blew gently , and waited ; blew gently and waited , over and over . Eventually he felt hands on his shoulders drawing him back , but he wrenched his body from their grip , and went back to the task until John , more roughly now , yanked him away from the little body , and ordered in a voice ragged with weeping , “
192977	193511	193512	193512	God	654	” a a Beaten , he sat back on his heels , and let a single despairing cry into the air . Only then , as the sound torn from his throat joined the high , thin wail of a newborn , did he understand . The infant 's squall was lost in the eruption of astonishment and joy . Fine Runa hands gathered the baby up and Emilio 's eyes followed the infant as it was cleaned and wrapped , round and round , with homespun cloth , and passed from embrace to embrace . For a long time , he stayed slumped were he was , blood - soaked and spent . Then he pushed himself to his feet and stood , swaying slightly , looking for Shetri Laaks . He was afraid the father would mourn the wife and curse the child . But Shetri was already holding the little one to his chest , eyes downcast , oblivious to everything but the son he jounced gently in his arms to quiet its crying . Emilio Sandoz turned away and ducked back into the stone hut , where he was greeted by the wreckage of a woman , as forgotten as he was in the rejoicing . We cremate our dead , Rukuei had said . When ? Two days ago ? Three ? So the Pope was right , Emilio thought numbly . No grave to dig . ... Drained of emotion , he sat down heavily , next to what had been Ha'anala . If anything could prove the existence of the soul , he thought , it is the utter emptiness of a corpse . Unbidden , unlooked for , the stillness came upon him : evoked by music and by death , and by the shadowless love that can only be felt at a birth . Once more , he felt the tidal pull , but this time he swam against it , as a man being swept out to sea fights the current . Putting his head in his hands , he CHILDREN OF GOD 401 let the weight of his skull press down on the hardware of his braces , for once in his life seeking a physical pain that he could rule , to block out what was beyond his control . It was a mistake . Tears that sprang from his body 's hurt now began to bleed from his soul 's wounds . For a long time , he was lost , and freshly maimed . It was not his body violated , not his blood spilt , not his love shattered , but he wept for the dead , for the irreversible wrongs , the terrible sorrows . For Ha'anala . For Shetri 's losses , and his own — for Gina and Celestina , and the life they might have had together . For Sofia , for Jimmy . For Marc , and D.W. , and Anne and George . For his parents , and his brother . For himself . When the sobbing quieted , he lay down next to Haʼanala , feeling as empty as her corpse . “
193514	193527	193528	193528	God	654	" he whispered , over and over , until exhaustion claimed him . “
193530	193531	193512	193512	God	654	” "
193532	193538	193539	193539	DANNY	728	“ SANDOZ ? I'M SORRY . ”
193547	193551	193552	193552	he	4876	“ I'M sorry , ”
193559	193573	193552	193552	he	4876	“ We waited as long as we could , but this is important . "
193611	193615	193616	193616	John	378	" You okay ? "
193631	193642	193643	193643	John	378	“ Look , there 's something you have to see , ”
193749	193752	193753	193753	Emilio	261	“ Jesus , ”
193761	193774	193753	193753	Emilio	261	“ Do you have an estimate of the size of that force ? ”
193775	193788	193789	193789	Joseba	395	“ I make it something over thirty thousand in the main body , ”
193855	193865	193866	193866	Danny	728	“ This looks like light infantry in the vanguard , ”
193880	193923	193866	193866	Danny	728	“ backed by armor , maybe two day 's march behind them . And that 's an image from about four days ago . Can you see how much brighter it looks ? We 're picking up the glare off the metal . "
193924	193935	193936	193936	Joseba	395	“ There 's infrared showing another large group behind them , ”
193939	193946	193936	193936	Joseba	395	“ Look at the next one . "

193977	193995	193996	193996	Emilio	261	“ But we came in above the cloud cover , and John stayed below the sound barrier ! ”
193999	194007	193996	193996	Emilio	261	“ How could they have tracked us ? "
194014	194031	194010	194010	Danny	728	“ Ca n't say for sure , ace , but I could give it a guess . ”

194057	194062	194063	194063	Nico	518	“ Looks that way . ”
194070	194087	194088	194088	he	518	“ So the signora does n't have to wait for us to bring Isaac to her , ”
194091	194099	194088	194088	he	518	“ She 's coming to get him . ”
194100	194110	194111	194111	Sean	390	" She does n't need an army t'do that , ”
194122	194133	194135	194137	Danny Iron Horse	385	“ Sandoz , there 's something else you should know , ”
194139	194170	194135	194137	Danny Iron Horse	385	“ When you three first went missing , Sofia Mendes swore she would ' track those djanada bastards to their lair and finish this , once and for all . ' ”
194171	194180	194182	194182	Sandoz	261	“ Yes . You can see the appeal , ”
194250	194258	194259	194259	he	261	“ We have to warn the VaN'Jarri , ”
194262	194288	194259	194259	he	261	“ They should probably evacuate . Pull back to that Athaansi 's settlement , yes ? Concentrate in one valley and set up a defense ? "
194294	194306	194289	194289	Danny	385	“ Fish in a barrel , once the artillery gets here . "
194307	194308	194259	194259	he	261	” "
194322	194326	194289	194289	Danny	385	" said Joseba , “

194452	194466	194472	194472	he	526	” John mused as Sean and Joseba stepped past Nico and strode off . “
194475	194487	194472	194472	he	526	” said Emilio , working through the images Frans had sent . “
194523	194531	194509	194510	The drone	4893	” He stopped , and then said , “

194541	194548	194509	194510	The drone	4893	" John asked , frightened now . "

194602	194617	194593	194593	he	526	” said Danny . Sandoz nodded , and Danny sighed , shaking his head . “
194625	194636	194637	194637	Carlo	526	" John cried , throwing his hands in the air . “

194700	194722	194723	194723	You	4898	” He was standing in the doorway , and the light behind him lit up his hair , obscuring his expression . “

By the time Emilio went outside , the evacuation of the N'Jarr valley was under way — parents gathering children , bundling possessions , arguing and shouting , making snap decisions , having second thoughts , trying not to panic . There was an island of calm in the midst of all this , and he pushed toward it , knowing somehow that Suukmel Chirot u Vaadai would be at its center , where Ha'anala 's pyre was still smoking . 404 Mary Doria Russell He dropped to his knees at her side . “

The priests stayed in the N’Jarr to help in whatever ways they could , but Nico would not hear of being separated from him and Emilio did not protest . It was unlikely that what they 'd face in twelve days ' time would yield to a handgun and a resolute attitude , but Nico had repeatedly proved his worth and Emilio was glad of his company . Tiyat and Kajpin came along as well , to lead the way through the mountain passes and twisted ravines and foothills . The plan was to walk back to the ruins of Inbrokar , and then go on a bit farther south , where they would wait on the road for Sofia and the Runa army to come upon them . By second sunset , Emilio and Nico were both bleeding from the knees , and Emilio was beginning to reconsider the definition of “

The sapphire hills darkened to indigo with distance , the near country afire with magenta blossoms flaring in sunlight , and Emilio began to be glad after all that they had remained on foot . Repetitive movement had always calmed him , narrowing the focus to the burning of his muscles , the impact of the ground against his feet . He did not try to anticipate Sofia 's arguments or his own . It will be well , he thought , hour after hour , putting one foot in front of the other like a pilgrim walking to Jerusalem . Over and over : It will be well . He did not believe this ; Ha'anala 's words simply matched the rhythm of his pace . They foraged frequently as they walked ; camped in the open , heedless of detection . “
196271	196279	196262	196262	they	4926	” Kajpin pointed out with untroubled practicality . “
196286	196455	196456	196456	We	4925	" By day , Emilio could almost match that fatalism , but the nights were bad , spent wandering in charred , empty dream - cities , or pacing in the noisy darkness waiting for dawn . At last , the others would rouse , and they 'd break their fast with leftovers from the previous night 's meal . Once or twice , Nico brought down some small game , but much of the meat went to waste . Emilio ate very little — his usual response to tension . Pacing restlessly until their journey resumed , he would lose himself in the silent chant : It will be well . Eight days ' travel south of the mountains , they saw the glint and flash of equipment in the sunlight , flaring now and then on the horizon . By late afternoon , they could pick out a dark mass at the base of a dust plume when the rolling land lifted the army into sight . "
196462	196473	196456	196456	We	4925	" Tiyat said , but she looked west and added , "
196480	196563	196564	196564	We	4925	” That night they all slept badly , and woke to haze and sultry air . Leaving the others to their breakfast , Emilio walked up a low rise , gazing out to- 408 Mary Doria Russell ward the army bivouac . The first sun had barely begun to climb , but even now the heat was making the ground dance and shimmer , and he was already sweating . Screw it , he thought , and called back to his companions , "
196569	196570	196564	196564	We	4925	” “
196574	196581	196564	196564	We	4925	” said Kajpin , joining him . “
196588	196695	196583	196583	them	4928	” They spent the morning sitting on the little hill , Nico and the Runa eating and chatting like picnickers waiting for a parade . But as the army grew closer and they saw the numbers , they fell as silent as Sandoz , ears straining for the first sounds . It was hard to tell if they truly heard or only imagined the thudding of feet , the clank of metal , the caroling of commands and commentary from the ranks ; storm clouds now hid the western horizon with columns of black rain , and the breeze carried away all but the nearest noises . “
196705	196741	196583	196583	them	4928	” Tiyat predicted uneasily , standing with her tail braced against a stiffening wind . The lightning in the west was nearly continuous , illuminating the underside of the thunderheads . Kajpin stood as well . “
196747	196761	196583	196583	them	4928	” she said without concern , but then added the more ominous phrase , “
196766	196797	196583	196583	them	4928	” Tramping down the hillock to a small dip in the ground , she sat again , lowering her profile , calmly contemplating the soldiers ' ranks before remarking cheerfully , “
196805	196806	196799	196799	I	0	” “
196817	196827	196810	196810	you	4930	" Nico asked . Emilio looked west and shrugged . “
196834	196835	196810	196810	you	4930	” “
196850	196851	196854	196854	Nico	518	" “
196864	196877	196810	196810	you	4930	” Sandoz said . He joined Tiyat and Kajpin , and repeated , “
196881	197268	196810	196810	you	4930	” Then , without looking back , he walked without hurry down the road until he 'd halved the distance and stood alone : a small flat - backed figure , silver and black hair lifted and blown by the breeze . By this time the vanguard had also come to a halt , and before long these ranks parted to make way for a curtained sedan chair borne from the bivouac by four Runa . Emilio tried to prepare himself for the sight of her , the sound of her voice , but gave up and simply watched as the bearers set the chair down gently . With dispatch , they unfurled a temporary shelter like a veranda around the litter , its waterproof fabric the color of marigolds , bright in the sunlight east of the approaching storm . There was a short delay while an ingeniously designed folding chair was brought forward from an equipa CHILDREN OF GOD 409 ment wagon , snapped into shape and placed in front of the conveyance . Finally a staircase , hinged at the base of the litter 's entrance , was tipped outward , and he saw a tiny hand as it separated the curtains and took a proffered arm as support in her descent . He had expected her to be altered but still lovely ; he was not disappointed . The raking scars and the empty socket were a shock , but the harsh suns of Rakhat had rendered her face so finely creased that it seemed made of gauze ; the seams of scar tissue were now merely three lines among many , and her remaining eye was lively and observant , and seemed to sweep her surroundings in continual compensation for her halved field of vision . Even the arc of her spine seemed graceful to him : a curve of curiosity , as though she had bent to examine some object on the ground that had caught her attention on her way to the camp chair . She sat , and looked up , her head tilted almost coyly , waiting for him . Delicate as a wren , with her small spare hands in her lap , she had in repose a skeletal purity : elegant and fleshless and still . “
197273	197277	197269	197269	Thou	4932	” he thought , "
197290	197291	197292	197292	Sofia	356	" “
197294	197310	197292	197292	Sofia	356	” he said and held his hands out to her . Her 's remained quiet . “
197318	197328	197329	197329	You	4934	” she observed coldly , when he drew near . “
197337	197351	197329	197329	You	4934	" She held his gaze with her one eye until his own dropped . “
197357	197369	197353	197353	you	4934	" she asked , when he could look at her again . “
197372	197411	197353	197353	you	4934	” he said . She stiffened slightly and took in a breath , and he understood then that Sofia had believed her son long dead , his name used heartlessly to lure more hostages to the djanada stronghold . “
197416	197420	197412	197412	Isaac	363	” he began . "
197423	197430	197412	197412	Isaac	363	” She gave a short laugh . "
197445	197446	197443	197443	you	4934	" "
197448	197449	197450	197450	They	4935	” “

197488	197498	197499	197499	He	363	" He hesitated , not wanting to wound her . "
197518	197534	197509	197509	He	363	” He stopped , looking past her to the troops visible beyond the golden tenting . “
197548	197549	197509	197509	He	363	” “
197555	197562	197509	197509	He	363	" she asked , smiling coolly . “

197611	197616	197617	197617	I	0	” she repeated softly . “
197635	197649	197624	197624	you	356	" she asked lightly , brows up , one twisted by scar tissue . “
197678	197686	197675	197675	me	0	” She stared at him , unblinking . “
197736	197743	197728	197728	you	356	” He refused to be intimidated . “

197788	197797	197784	197784	they	4939	" she asked . She snorted with derision . “

198103	198141	198090	198090	Sofia	356	” The sound was like a gunshot , flat and unresonant , and he could feel the exact outline of her hand , stinging and sharp , form on his face . CHILDREN OF GOD 411 a > “
198146	198150	198144	198144	you	356	” she whispered . “
198174	198229	198230	198230	I	0	" He stood still , face averted , waiting for the sensation to ease , eyes wide to keep the tears from spilling . Tried to imagine forty years alone and unsupported , without John or Gina , without Vince Giuliani or Edward Behr , or any of the others who 'd helped him . “
198234	198239	198240	198240	I	0	” he said finally . “

198428	198436	198425	198425	you	356	” he told her with bleak cheer , “
198484	198485	198477	198477	They	4956	” “
198491	198516	198477	198477	They	4956	” Incredulous , she stood , and left her chair and walked a step or two , bent and hobbled by a coiled spine . “
198537	198546	198526	198526	you	356	" she asked , face twisted with contempt . “
198560	198561	198562	198562	You	356	” "
198570	198582	198564	198564	I	0	" he shouted , his own anger rising to meet hers . “

198733	198742	198721	198721	I	0	” he said , holding up his hands . “
198820	198854	198810	198810	He	295	" . He stopped , spun from her , hardly able to breathe , but turned , trembling , and held her uneasy gaze as he said in a voice soft with outrage , “

199342	199364	199365	199366	The child	923	" He watched her react , her head jerking as though recoiling from a blow , and he pressed on mercilessly . “
199472	199500	199501	199501	I	0	" The rain was beginning - heavy drops as warm as tears — wind whipping the fabric of the shelter noisily , almost drowning out his words . “

199629	199636	199622	199622	You	356	” he said , voice fraying . “
199729	199741	199742	199742	Sofia	356	” He stopped again , hardly able to utter the words . “
199795	199804	199805	199805	I	0	” He shrugged helplessly at her stricken glare . “
199871	199887	199901	199901	God	295	" he shouted , trying to make himself heard through the roar of the rain . “

For a long time , she simply stood in the downpour , listening to its hissing crash , feeling it beat down on her twisted shoulders , work its way through her hair , wash over the ruins of her face . a 414 Mary Doria Russell When she came back from where she had been in memory , Emilio was waiting for her . Soaked and chilled , she walked slowly to her chair , accepting his offer of an arm to steady her climb . When she reached the platform , she sat as heavily as a tiny woman could . The first violence of the storm was passing , the rain now a steady drumming , and for a time they simply gazed out at the drowning landscape . She touched his shoulder and he turned to her . Reaching up , she placed her hand gently over the mark she 'd laid there , minutes before , and then lifted a lock of his hair . “
200114	200118	200106	200106	You	5010	” she said . “
200132	200147	200128	200128	I	0	” His reply was starchy , but the red - rimmed eyes were amused . “
200170	200178	200162	200162	I	0	" He made no move to go . "
200184	200188	200179	200179	I	0	” she said . “

200243	200248	200231	200231	He	654	” Emilio said wearily . “
200265	200281	200295	200295	you	356	" He walked to the edge of the awning to stare out at the rain . “
200347	200363	200338	200338	Sandoz	261	" Braced hands limp at his sides , he snorted at his own absurd grandiosity . “
200388	200435	200436	200437	Miz Mendes	745	” Then , without warning , his posture shifted . He became , somehow , taller , rangier , and Sofia Mendes heard once more the beloved Texas twang of D. W. Yarbrough , the long - dead priest who 'd taught them both so much . "
200439	200449	200436	200437	Miz Mendes	745	" Emilio drawled , defeated but not without humor , "
200462	200556	200557	200557	Signora	356	" TALKED OUT , EMILIO SAT ON THE GROUND NEXT TO HER , AND TOGETHER they watched rain turn the world to mud . Before long , she realized he had fallen asleep , propped against the supports of her chair , the crippled hands lax in his lap . Mind empty , she listened to his soft snore and might have CHILDREN OF GOD 415 slept herself if she had not been disturbed by a huge and sodden young man , clutching a cloth cap and stooping to peer under the awning . “
200568	200573	200557	200557	Signora	356	” he asked anxiously . “
200579	200590	200591	200591	My	0	" she asked very quietly , glancing significantly at Emilio . “

200629	200642	200623	200624	The angels	2894	” She smiled , and he took that for a good sign . “
200650	200662	200663	200665	The Jana people	5023	” he asked again coming in , out of the rain . “
200680	200689	200663	200665	The Jana people	5023	" She did n't answer so he said , “
200712	200713	200706	200706	he	418	" “
200714	200726	200663	200665	The Jana people	5023	" He 's asleep . He must have been very tired . ”
200727	200738	200706	200706	he	418	“ He has nightmares . He 's afraid to sleep . ”
200739	200747	200663	200665	The Jana people	5023	" Are you a friend of his ? "
200749	200763	200706	200706	he	418	“ I 'm his bodyguard . I think his friends are all dead . ”
200785	200797	200782	200782	he	518	“ You 're his friend , and you 're not dead . ”
200798	200802	200803	200803	Sofia	356	" Not yet , "
200823	200830	200831	200831	he	518	“ I like the storms here , ”
200834	200845	200831	200831	he	518	“ They remind me of the last act of Rigoletto . "

200877	200902	200903	200903	She	356	“ He wants you to visit him , but I think he should put some clothes on first . Did I say something wrong ? "
200908	200911	200903	200903	She	356	“ No . ”
200918	200925	200912	200912	She	356	" Isaac has never liked clothes . ”

200935	200948	200949	200949	She	356	“ Yes . Yes , indeed . Isaac has always liked music . ”
200960	200970	200949	200949	She	356	“ Signor d'Angeli , did my son appear well ? ”
200971	200983	200985	200985	Nico	518	“ He 's skinny , but they all are up there , ”
200992	201047	200985	200985	Nico	518	“ There was a lady who died having a baby before we left . Joseba thinks she was too skinny and that 's why she died — because she was n't strong enough . We brought food , but a lot of people were so hungry , they threw up from eating too fast . ”
201090	201097	201098	201098	he	518	" What should we do now ? ”
201119	201125	201126	201126	she	5026	“ I 'm not sure , ”
201130	201138	201126	201126	she	5026	“ I need some time to think . ”

201222	201234	201235	201235	she	5026	“ I have spoken with your colleagues in the N'Jarr valley , ”
201241	201249	201250	201250	She	5026	“ and to a woman named Suukmel . ”
201256	201369	201250	201250	She	5026	“ I do n't rule here , Emilio , no matter what your djanada friends told you . But I have some influence . I will do my best to arrange safe conduct for a delegation of VaN’Jarri to speak with the Parliament of Elders . It will take time and it wo n't be easy , even to get you a hearing . The elders remember what it was like , before . There is a woman named Djalao Vakashan who will be difficult to convince . But I will tell them that you and the priests are good men with good hearts . I ca n't promise more than that . "
201383	201387	201370	201370	He	5028	“ Thank you . ”

202695	202711	202692	202692	John	378	“ Sean and Joseba are out looking for you , What happened to your knees ? "
202712	202718	202719	202719	Danny	385	“ Nothing . I slipped , ”

202750	202766	202767	202767	He	385	“ I do n't know . I have n't looked at a watch in days . "
202778	202790	202767	202767	He	385	“ Must be about eight in the evening , I guess . "
202792	202814	202815	202815	Danny	385	“ So it 's just after supper , ship 's time ? Good . I 've got a job for you , "
202828	202847	202815	202815	Danny	385	“ I want you to get Frans on the radio . Tell him to try the yasapa brandy . ”
202860	202869	202870	202870	Danny	385	“ I could ask you to trust me , ”
202877	202891	202870	202870	Danny	385	“ or I could just tell you to do as you 're told . "
202906	202914	202915	202915	he	378	“ Ours is not to reason why , ”
202933	202944	202945	202945	he	378	“ I do n't suppose you 'd like to explain ? ”
202953	202956	202958	202958	Danny	385	“ Look , ”
202960	203002	202958	202958	Danny	385	“ I could do this myself , but I promise you it 'll be more fun if you help . Just suggest to Frans that this would be a very good time to have a nice little postprandial drink , okay ? ”
203008	203016	203005	203005	John	378	“ But then he 'll tell Carlo — "

203145	203154	203136	203136	Frans	533	“ Lucky guess . Had a taste yet ? ”
203155	203158	203136	203136	Frans	533	" No . "

203306	203320	203321	203321	Danny	385	“ Hell , no . This is all going to shake out fine , ”
203325	203393	203321	203321	Danny	385	" The question is , Do you want to discuss terms with me now ? Or would you like to try your luck with Sofia Mendes again ? I should mention that I 've had a little talk with her , and she seems to feel you 've misrepresented a few facts when you made that last deal with her . She sounded kind of pissed off . ”
203417	203434	203435	203435	Danny	385	“ Or you could come on back down to Rakhat and deal directly with the Runa , ”
203445	203486	203435	203435	Danny	385	“ Just keep that anaphylaxis kit handy . Course , you 'll have to hope you can explain to some Runao how to use it , because we wo n't be around to help you . Your call , ace . ”
203497	203503	203504	203504	Carlo	284	“ And your terms are ? "
203525	203540	203541	203541	Danny	385	“ You off - load all your trade goods here in the N'Jarr valley , ”
203544	203570	203541	203541	Danny	385	“ and do n't try to bullshit me , because I 've read the manifests . We keep the manned lander and all its fuel — ”
203571	203578	203579	203579	Carlo	284	" The lander cost a fortune ! "
203582	203604	203605	203605	Danny	385	“ Yeah , but by the time you get back to Earth , that plane'll be older than most second wives , ”
203633	203638	203639	203639	Danny	385	“ Now , then , ”
203642	203664	203639	203639	Danny	385	“ our cut will be one hundred percent of the coffee trade , but we 'll broker the rest a for you "
203665	203690	203691	203691	Carlo	284	“ What guarantee do I have that you wo n't keep the drone after I send 422 Mary Doria Russell the last shipment down ? ”
203695	203707	203691	203691	Carlo	284	" You could leave me with a half - empty hold . ”
203708	203720	203721	203721	John	378	" Which is exactly what you deserve , you miserable SOB , ”
203731	203746	203748	203748	Danny	385	“ I guess you 're just going to have to trust me , ace , ”
203771	203786	203787	203787	Carlo	284	“ But if you think you can get a better deal from somebody else ... "
203798	203803	203804	203804	EMILIO	654	“ ARE YOU SERIOUS ? "
203823	203836	203812	203812	KAJPIN	701	“ Danny , the reservations were a disaster for the Indians — _ "
203837	203847	203848	203849	the Canadian	5083	" Sandoz , this is not the United States , "
203853	203869	203848	203849	the Canadian	5083	“ and we are not the BIA , and we have the benefit of hindsight , ”
203870	203879	203880	203880	Joseba	395	“ And a reservation is better than extinction , ”
203887	203924	203880	203880	Joseba	395	“ I estimate that even an increase of ten additional deaths a year over present rates could kill the Jana'ata off in a couple of generations . If you have to choose between apartheid and genocide — ”
203925	203939	203940	203940	John	378	“ And Danny knows all the ways a reservation system can be awful , "
203943	203948	203940	203940	John	378	“ so he can — "
203949	203956	203957	203957	Sean	390	“ Desperate measures for desperate times , ”
203961	203997	203957	203957	Sean	390	“ And as much as I hate partition , it 's a way to stop the killin ' . Gives people time to get over their grudges , or at least stop accumulating new ones — ”
203998	204005	204006	204006	Emilio	261	" Wait , wait , wait ! "
204087	204091	204092	204092	he	261	“ All right , ”
204106	204112	204092	204092	he	261	“ Tell me again ... ? "
204113	204122	204124	204124	Danny	385	“ I see this as politically independent territory , ”
204126	204180	204124	204124	Danny	385	“ The Jana'ata are already isolated up here — it 's just a matter of getting the government in the south to formalize the situation ! And Suukmel thinks this may be a workable solution . She 's convinced Shetri , and they 're off trying to get Athaansi 's faction on board . ”
204221	204230	204213	204213	nobody	5860	" Have you spoken to Sofia about this ? "

204245	204270	204237	204237	John	378	“ We talked to her a few days ago . It 's not like we were sitting here sucking our thumbs while you were gone- "
204271	204280	204282	204282	Danny	385	" She said she 'd float the idea , ”
204284	204305	204282	204282	Danny	385	“ but it 'll be up to the Runa Parliament in Gayjur . It 's going to take time , but ”
204306	204312	204313	204313	Joseba	395	“ The problem right now , ”
204316	204358	204313	204313	Joseba	395	“ is getting the word out so the VaN'Jarri know that the army 's turned back and it 's safe to come home . We should have set up some kind of signal for that , but nobody thought of it . "
204371	204375	204376	204376	he	518	“ Don Emilio , ”
204380	204392	204376	204376	he	518	“ I think you should sit down . Are you hungry ? "
204407	204420	204421	204421	Joseba	395	“ — going to rebuild their numbers , they 'll need food , ”
204425	204467	204468	204468	He	518	“ and plenty of it , but that central plains region is a meat factory , and perhaps the Runa would be willing to provide game in exchange for coffee or something . Eventually we 'll find something new to domesticate . ”
204482	204485	204421	204421	Joseba	395	“ we . ”
204486	204501	204468	204468	He	518	“ The Jana'ata think kha'ani could be bred to lay eggs all year round — ”

204578	204589	204575	204575	Sean	390	“ but you and Sandoz'll be goin' home after all . "

206015	206054	205994	205994	You	0	” Emilio confirmed , falling into Isaac 's pattern : a burst of talk , perhaps three seconds long , then a silence of thirty seconds before the next burst . A longer pause meant , Your turn . "

206529	206567	206527	206527	you	0	” There was a kind of numbness . Not the ecstasy , not the oceanic serenity he had once known , a lifetime ago . Just : numbness . When he could speak again , he asked , “

206587	206596	206520	206520	I	0	” Isaac yawned and handed Emilio the tablet . "

The weather on Rakhat was notoriously changeable and the Milky Way was rapidly losing custody of the night to clouds , but he knew that when it was clear , he could look up and , without effort , recognize familiar patterns . Orion , Ursa major , Ursa minor , the Pleiades : arbitrary shapes imposed on random points of light . “

Like father , like son , he thought then , realizing that Jimmy Quinn had , like his extraordinary child , discovered an unearthly music that changed one 's perspective . He was pleased by that , and grateful . 428 Mary Doria Russell EMILIO WOKE JOHN FIRST , AND LED HIM A LITTLE DISTANCE AWAY FROM the settlement to a place where they could listen to the music alone ; where they could speak in privacy , where Emilio could study his friend 's face as he listened and see his own astonishment and awe mirrored . “
206917	206927	206914	206915	My God	1886	” John breathed , when the last notes faded . “

207460	207478	207423	207423	I	0	” Emilio looked away , blinking . When he could speak again , his voice was steady . “
207497	207510	207490	207490	you	353	” John nodded once and then again , as though confirming something . “
207520	208120	207511	207511	I	0	” he said . Coda Earth : 2096 ONCE AGAIN RADIO WAVES CARRIED MUSIC FROM RAKHAT TO EARTH , and once again Emilio Sandoz was preceded by news that would change his life . Long before he arrived home , reaction to the DNA music had rigidified . Believers found it a miraculous confirmation of God 's existence and evidence of Divine Providence . Skeptics declared it a fraud — a clever trick by the Jesuits to distract attention from their earlier failures . Atheists did not dispute the music 's authenticity , but they considered it just another fluke that proved nothing — like the universe itself . Agnostics admitted the music was magnificent , but suspended judgment , waiting for who knew what ? The pattern was established at Sinai and under the Buddha 's tree ; on Calvary and at Mecca ; in sacred caves , at wells of life , amid circles of stone . Signs and wonders are always doubted , and perhaps they are meant to be . In the absence of certainty , faith is more than mere opinion ; it is hope . Emilio himself had read once of a savant in Lesotho who had memorized every street in every city in Africa . If such a person made names into notes , would he have found harmony in addresses ? Perhaps — given enough material and enough time and nothing better to do . And if that happened , Emilio asked himself on the long voyage home , would the music be any less beautiful ? CHILDREN OF GOD 431 He was a linguist , after all , and it seemed entirely possible to him that religion and literature and art and music were all merely side effects of a brain structure that comes into the world ready to make language out of noise , sense out of chaos . Our capacity for imposing meaning , he thought , is programmed to unfold the way a butterfly 's wings unfold when it escapes the chrysalis , ready to fly . We are biologically driven to create meaning . And if that 's so , he asked himself , is the miracle diminished ? It was then that he came very close to prayer . Whatever the truth is , he thought , blessed be the truth . The Giordano Bruno was nearly halfway home when Nico noticed that Don Emilio 's nightmares had ended . WITH ONLY SIX MONTHS OF SUBJECTIVE TIME BEFORE THEIR ARRIVAL ON Earth , Emilio Sandoz concentrated on the task at hand : teaching Rukuei English , trying to prepare the poet for what might await him . It helped to worry about someone else , to put his own experience to work in Rukuei 's behalf . Suspended in time , Emilio refused to listen to the transmissions from Rakhat that Frans intercepted , ignored the responses from Earth . It will be well , he told himself , and let the universe take care of itself while he took care of one apt and eager student . So when Frans Vanderhelst finally docked the Bruno at the Shimatsu Orbital Hotel high above the Pacific , Emilio Sandoz was , in many ways , a man at peace . He was , therefore , completely unprepared for his reaction to a letter that had been waiting for him nearly four decades . Handwritten on a fine rag paper , selected because it would not crumble during his anticipated absence from Earth , the note read : “
208192	208243	208189	208190	Vince Giuliani	281	” The middle - aged Jesuit who handed Sandoz the note did not know its contents , but he knew its author and the circumstances under which it was written , so he could take a pretty good guess at what that long - dead Father General must have said . “
208255	208320	208251	208251	you	5145	" Sandoz cried , confirming the priest 's hypothesis . The rest of the commentary was heartfelt and in a splendid assortment of languages . When Sandoz was done , 432 Mary Doria Russell and he did not finish quickly , he stood in the curving air lock , the letter in one braced hand , arms at his sides , limp with exasperation . “
208327	208333	208251	208251	you	5145	" he demanded in English . “
208338	208349	208350	208350	I	0	” the priest replied , and continued in excellent Spanish . “
208427	208872	208943	208943	anyone	5249	" Still fuming , Sandoz nevertheless listened to Tamang 's summary of the steps that had been taken to make Rukuei comfortable , and to ease the return of Sandoz and the crew of the Giordano Bruno . The hotel staff consisted of carefully chosen , highly trained volunteers who 'd studied the history of the Jesuit missions and who all spoke at least some K'San . A medical team was standing by ; the travelers would be isolated for some months , but the entire hotel had been booked for them and the facilities were quite nice and very extensive . There was a customized suite set aside for Frans Vanderhelst in the center of the hotel , near the microgravity stadium , where he would be able to breathe without strain . Endocrine experts were waiting to examine him ; they had some hope of reversing the genetic damage that had unbalanced his metabolism . Carlo Giuliani 's cargo had , of course , been impounded , pending customs decisions . Giuliani himself was being detained — there were complex legal issues to be settled , not the least of which was whether Sandoz wished to file charges regarding his abduction . Signor Giuliani 's elderly sister had been notified of his return , but seemed in no hurry to provide him with legal representation . The accumulated news from Rakhat was mixed . Athaansi Laaks had been overthrown , but his faction still refused to agree to the reservation solution ; Danny Iron Horse sympathized , but continued to press for negotiations . Some kind of illness swept through the N’Jarr in 2084 but , by that time , the Jana’ata were better fed and the toll was n't as high as everyone first feared it would be . John Candotti had written of Sofia 's death . Shetri Laaks was well , and had remarried . Two more sons had joined the one Emilio had delivered — now a young man with a child of his own . Shetri 's second wife was pregnant again ; they hoped for a third daughter . Sean 's latest census of the Jana’ata reported a population of nearly twenty - six a CHILDREN OF GOD 433 hundred souls . Joseba added an analysis indicating that if birth and death rates and other conditions held steady , this was enough for stability . Some forty Runa had joined the VaN'Jarri in the year of the census . These did not quite balance the number of old VaN’Jarri Runa who had died , but it was a slight increase over the inflow from prior years . "
208878	208891	208874	208874	Suukmel	545	" Emilio asked , knowing this would be Rukuei 's first question . "
208894	208898	208874	208874	Suukmel	545	" said Patras , “

209112	209117	209109	209109	He	261	“ You 're joking ! ”
209147	209162	209163	209163	Patras	759	“ Well , yes , as a matter of fact , I am joking , ”
209174	209187	209188	209188	Emilio	261	“ You know , it 's not nice to tease old people , ”
209197	209209	209188	209188	Emilio	261	" How long have you been waiting to use that line ? "

209293	209351	209285	209286	Emilio Sandoz	261	“ There was a woman Inquiries followed ; databases were searched . She had , evidently , remarried , changed her surname ; had shunned publicity and lived as private a 434 Mary Doria Russell life as wealth could buy and guilt enforce . It was remarkably difficult to find even a minimal actuarial mention of her . “
209358	209365	209366	209366	She	5158	" Patras told him weeks later . "
209372	209574	209366	209366	She	5158	" a a ARIANA FIORE HAD ALWAYS ENJOYED THE DAY OF THE DEAD . SHE LIKED the cemetery , tidy and rectilinear , with its stone paths freshly swept between rows and rows of high - walled burial niches — an island of grace amid the noise of Naples . The vaults themselves , stacked six high , were always brushed and dustless on November first , golden in autumnal sunlight or gleaming in silvery rain . She was an archaeologist , accustomed to the presence of the dead , and savored this orderliness , taking pleasure in the sharp scent of chrysanthemums mingling with the deeper musk of fallen leaves . Some of the loculi were simple : a polished brass plaque with a name and dates , the tiny luminos kept burning for a time after the death . The proud and the prosperous often added a small screen that could be activated with a touch , and she 'd have liked to go from vault to vault , meeting the inhabitants , hearing about their lives , but resisted the impulse . All around her , there were low voices and the crunch of footsteps on gravel paths . “
209577	209766	209767	209767	Padre	649	” she heard now and then , as flowers were placed with a sigh in a loculo 's little vase . Old affections , grudges , attachments and debts were silently acknowledged and then put aside for another year . Adults gossiped , children fidgeted . There was a sense of occasion and a formality that appealed to Ariana , but the cemetery was not a scene of active grief . Which is why she noticed the man sitting on the bench in front of Gina 's vault , gloved hands limp in his lap . Alone among the mourners on this cool and sunny day , he was crying , eyes open , silent tears slipping down a still face . She had no wish to impose herself on this stranger , had not even been certain that he would come today . His first months out of isolation were a circus , a whirlwind of public interest and private receptions — every moment accounted for . Ariana had waited a long time , but she was patient by nature . And now : here he was . "
209769	209789	209790	209790	I	0	" she said , soft - voiced and certain . Solitary in sorrow , he hardly glanced at her . “
