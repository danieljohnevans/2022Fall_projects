3359	3364	3340	3343	The rest of us	612	” Nicolin said intently . “
3375	4291	3367	3367	God	251	" As we walked up from the point I took myself off from the rest , and followed the cliff 's edge . Out on the wide beach the tidal puddles streaking the sand were a dark silver , banded with red — little models of the vast ocean surging beyond them . On the other side of me was the valley , our valley , winding up into the hills that crowded the sea . The trees of the forest blanketing the hills all waved their branches in the sunset onshore wind , and their late spring greens were tinted pollen color by the drowning sun . For miles up and down the curving reach of the coast the forest tossed , fir and spruce and pine like the hair of a living creature , and as I walked I felt the wind toss my hair too . On the ravine - creased hillsides not one sign of man could be seen ( though they were there ) , it was nothing but trees , tall and short , redwood and torrey pine and eucalyptus , dark green hills cascading into the sea , and as I walked the amber cliff 's edge I was happy . I did n't have the slightest inkling of a notion that my friends and I were starting a summer that would ... change us . As I write this account of those months , deep in the harshest winter I have ever known , I have the advantage of time passed , and I can see that this excursion in search of silver was the start of it -- not so much because of what happened , understand , but because of what did n't happen , because of the ways in which we were deceived . Because of what it gave us a taste for . I was hungry , you see ; not just for food ( that was a constant ) , but for a life that was more than fishing , and hoeing weeds , and checking snares . And Nicolin was hungrier than I. But I 'm getting ahead of my story . As I strolled the steep sandstone border between forest and sea , I had no premonition of what was to come , nor any heed for the warnings of the old man . I was just excited by the thought of an adventure . As I turned up the south path towards the little cabin that my pa and I shared , the smells of pine and sea salt raked the insides of my nose and made me drunk with hunger , and happily I imagined chips of silver the size of a dozen dimes . It occurred to me that my friends and I were for the very first time in our lives actually going to do what we had so often boastfully THE WILD SHORE planned to do — and at the thought I felt a thrilling shiver of anticipation , I leaped from root to root in the trail : we were invading the territory of the scavengers , venturing north into the ruins of Orange County . The night we picked to do it , fog was smoking up off the ocean and gusting onshore , under a quarter moon that gave all the white mist patches a faint glow . I waited just inside the door of our cabin , ignoring Pa 's snores . I had read him to sleep an hour before , and now he lay heavily on his side , calloused fingers resting on the crease in the side of his head . Pa is lame , and simple , on account of tangling with a horse when I was young . My ma always used to read him to sleep , and when she died Pa sent me up to Tom 's to carry on with my learning , saying in his slow way that it would be good for both of us . Right he was , I suppose . I warmed my hands now and then over the gray coals of the stove fire , as I had the cabin door partway open , and it was cold . Outside , the big eucalyptus down the path blew in and out of visibility . Once I thought I saw figures standing under it ; then a clammy puff of fog drifted onto the house , smelling like the rivermouth flats , and when it cleared away the tree stood alone . I wished the others would come . Except for Pa 's snoring there was no sound but the quiet patter of fog dew , sliding off leaves onto our roof . W - whooo , w - whooo . Nicolin 's call startled me from a doze . It was a pretty good imitation of the big canyon owls , although the owls only called out once a year or so , it seemed , so it did n't make much sense as a secret call in my opinion . It did beat a leopard 's cough , however , which had been Nicolin 's first choice , and which might have gotten him shot . I slipped out the door and hurried down the path to the eucalyptus . Nicolin had Del 's two shovels over his shoulders ; Del and Gabby stood behind him . "

5578	5581	5582	5582	Nicolin	278	“ Better , ”

5643	5646	5647	5647	he	278	“ Well ? ”
5651	5745	5647	5647	he	278	“ You want some of this silver ? So I walked over and started cutting ; I had wanted to before , but it made me nervous . When we had the grass pulled away so the dirt was exposed , we started digging in earnest . When we were in up to our knees we gave the shovels to Gabby and Del , panting some . I was sweating easily in the fog , and I cooled off fast . Clods of the wet clay squashed unhere ; better light the lantern . ”
5892	5898	5899	5899	he	279	“ They buried them deep , ”
5912	5921	5922	5922	Del	282	“ Maybe this one 's already dug up , ”
5949	5952	5953	5953	Nicolin	278	“ Sure , ”
5956	5970	5953	5953	Nicolin	278	“ Or maybe they buried him alive and he crawled out by himself . ”

6360	6392	6357	6357	Nicolin	278	" Henry , you 've done the least digging so far , and you 're long and skinny , so crawl down there and start pushing the dirt back to us . "

7369	7410	7363	7363	Nicolin	285	“ You know , since they had those plastic handles colored silver , it must mean that some time before that people were buried with real silver handles - richer people , or people buried before 1984 , or whatever . ”
7466	7474	7475	7475	Gabby	279	“ Some sort of God damned plastic , ”

11636	11675	11537	11537	Tom	351	" I went down to look at him . Washed up just north of the rivermouth . A Japanese , I 'd venture . We buried him at the back of the graveyard with the rest of them . ”

I have n't seen a foreigner - a live foreigner , that is — those dead ones make mighty poor informants , hee hee - since the day . That 's too long for coincidence , not that there are n't contributing indications . But that 's the main fact ; where are they?- since they are out there . ”

It 's a blessing to know something for sure , Henry . Surprisingly few things you can say that about . Knowledge is like quicksilver . ”

14275	14317	14268	14268	Steve	285	“ Because it usually was silver , of course . You just dug up some poor guy who died broke . His family bought him a cheap coffin . Now , what were you doing digging up graves for , anyway ? ”

Then one day some giant drew a straight line down it all , and everything THE WILD SHORE 31 west of the line fell down and the ocean came rushing in . Where the line crossed a hill there 's a cliff , and where it crossed a valley there 's a marsh and a beach . But always a straight line , see ? The hills do n't stick out into the ocean , and water does n't come and fill in the valleys . "

Very slowly - in your lifetime it might move an inch - in mine two , hee hee — and we 're next to a fault where the plates meet . The Pacific plate is sliding north , and the land here south . That 's why you get the straight line there . And earthquakes — you 've felt them- those are the two plates slipping , grinding against each other . One time ... one time in the old time , there was an earthquake that shattered every city on this coast . Buildings fell like they did on the day . Fires burned and there was no water to put them out . Freeways like that one down there pointed at the sky , and no one could get in to help , at first . For a lot of people it was the end . But when the fires were burned out ... they came from everywhere . They brought in giant machines and material , and they used the rubble that was all that was left of the cities . A month later every one of those cities was built back up again , just as they had been before , so exactly that you could n't even tell there had been an earthquake . ”

Honey'll keep away colds and all ailments of the lungs , it 'll get rid of gout and bad breath , it tastes ten times better than sugar , it 'll help you live as long as me , and it 's new and natural , not some sixty - year - old synthetic junk .

20820	20889	20817	20817	he	287	“ It would mean there would n't be any God damned Chinese boating off the coast , watching us all the time and bombing every attempt we make to rebuild !

21061	21153	21154	21154	Doc	287	“ That poor country did n't even own a firecracker when we were done with it . And Eliot probably was n't the man who decided not to retaliate , either . He probably died in the first moments of the day , like everyone else . It was some general in a plane who made the decision , you can bet your wooden teeth . And quite a surprise it must have been , too , even to him . Especially to him . Makes me wonder who he was . ”

After some long kisses she sort of let her weight go on me , and I slid down the tree with her , scraping my back good on the bark . Once on the leaves I laid half on top , half beside her , a leg between hers , an awkward position , but it was making my blood pound . We were kissing without pause and I could feel her breathing fast , humming little gasps . I tried to get my hand down her pants but could n't get it far enough , so I pushed it up under her shirt and held her breast . She bit my neck and a jolt ran down that whole side of my body . Someone with a lantern walked by on the promenade , and for a second I could see her shoulder : dirty white cotton twisted against pale skin , the swell of her breast pushed up by my hand ... back to kissing , with the image clear in my closed eyes . She pulled back . "

I helped her to her feet and took a piece of bark out of my back . And laughed . I walked Melissa into camp and with a final quick kiss left her near her father 's set - up . I went back out in the grove to take a leak . Off through the treetrunks I could still see the scavengers ' camps , bouncing in the firelight , and faintly I could hear a group of them singing “
23673	23844	23669	23671	America the Beautiful	327	” I sang along under my breath , a perfect harmony part that only I could 50 Kim Stanley Robinson hear , and the old tune filled my heart . Back on the promenade in front of our camp I saw the old man , talking with two strangers dressed in dark coats . The old man asked them questions , but I could n't make out the words . Wondering who they were , I stumbled back to my sleeping spot . I laid down , head spinning , and looked up at the black branches against the sky , every pine needle clear as an ink stroke . I figured I 'd be out in a second . But when I settled down there was a noise ; someone was crushing leaves over and over again , crick , crick , crick , crick ... from where Steve slept . I started listening and before long I heard breathing , and a soft , rhythmic expelling of breath , “
23851	23980	23981	23981	Hank	284	" I knew it was Kathryn 's voice . My hard - on was back ; I was n't going to be able to fall asleep . After a minute 's listening I felt strange , and making some irritated noises , I got up and went out to the front of the camp , where the fire was a warm mass of coals . I sat watching them shift from gray to orange with every breath of wind , feeling horny and envious and drunk and happy . All of a sudden the old man crashed into camp , looking drunker than I by a good deal . His scruff of hair flew around his head like smoke . He saw me and squatted by the fire . “
23983	23992	23981	23981	Hank	284	” he said , his voice uncommonly excited . “
24007	24008	23999	24005	two men who were looking for me	1135	” "
24021	24035	24036	24036	Hank	284	” He looked at me , his bloodshot eyes gleaming with reflected firelight . "
24096	24098	24099	24100	The men	772	" . "
24102	24103	24099	24100	The men	772	” “
24119	24145	24146	24146	They	1141	” We sat there staring at each other over the fire , and some little flames popped up . Light danced on his wild eyes . “
24151	24274	24146	24146	They	1141	" Chapter Four A few days after we got back from the meet , Pa and I woke up to the sound of a hard rain drumming on the roof . We ate a whole loaf of bread and made a big fire , and sat down to needle clothes , but the rain fisted the roof harder and harder , and when we looked out the door we could scarcely see the big eucalyptus in the general gray . It looked like the ocean had decided to jump up and wash us down to it , and the young crops would be the first to go . Plants , stakes , the soil itself ; they 'd all be ripped away . “
24285	24289	24146	24146	They	1141	" Pa said . “
24295	24364	24146	24146	They	1141	” We paced around the dark room in the firelight , got out our rain gear and paced some more , chattering with excitement . In a sheet downpour we heard Rafael 's bugle faintly calling over the roar of the rain , hitting high - low - highlow - high - low . We put on our gear and rushed out , and were drenched in seconds . “
24367	24872	24146	24146	They	1141	" Pa cried , and ran for the bridge , splashing through puddles . At the bridge a few people were huddled 51 52 Kim Stanley Robinson under ponchos and umbrellas , waiting for the tarps to arrive . Pa and I ran to the bathhouse beside the river path , which was now a little creek bordering the foaming brown river . We had to dodge the occasional group of three or four trundling along awkwardly under the weight of one of the long tarps . At the bathhouse shed the Mendezes , Mando and Doc Costa , and Steve and Kathryn were hauling out tarps and lifting them onto the shoulders of whoever was there . I jumped under the end of a roll and followed it off , spurred by Kathryn 's sharp voice . She had her whole crew jumping , no doubt of that . And it rained down on us like the world was under a waterfall . I helped run three tarps over the bridge and out to the fields , and then it was time to get them down . Mando and I got on one end of a roll — loosely rolled plastic it was , once clear , now opaque with mud — and leaned over to get our arms around it . Rain poured onto my lower back and down my pants ; my poncho was flying around my shoulders . Gabby and Kristen were on the other end of our roll , and the four of us maneuvered it into position at the downhill end of some rows of cabbage . We unrolled it one lift at a time , grunting and shouting directions at each other , walking up the furrows ankle deep in water . The field sloped ahead of us black and lumpy . Gray pools of water bounced under the rain 's onslaught where the grading was not right . When we got to the end of the roll the last cabbages were just covered . Walking back I saw that under the tarps quite a few plants were getting bent into the furrows . It was a poor protection system , but the best we had . Below us small bowed figures were unfurling other tarps : the Hamishes , the Eggloffs , Manuel Reyes and the rest of Kathryn 's farm crew plus Rafael and Steve . Beyond them the river churned , a brown flood studded with treetrunks and drowned shrubs . A thinner cloud rushed over and for a moment the light changed , so that everything glowed through the streaky veils of rain . Then just as suddenly it was twilight again . The old man was at the bottom of the field helping to position the rest of the tarps , striding about under his shoulder umbrella , a plastic thing held over his head by two poles strapped to his back . I laughed and felt the rain in my mouth : “
24886	24887	24877	24877	he	1145	” “
24893	24905	24877	24877	he	1145	” Mando said , hands clamped in his armpits for warmth . “
24916	24921	24922	24922	He	1145	" THE WILD SHORE 53 "
24935	25092	24922	24922	He	1145	" Gabby and Kristen joined us at the bottom . Gabby had fallen and was completely covered with mud . His sheepish grin was extra white by contrast . We got on another roll and began pulling it uphill . Wind hit the trees on the hill above and their branches bobbed and bent , as if the hillside were a big animal struggling under the storm , going whoooo , whoooo , and making the valley seem vast . Water poured down the tarps that were already laid . On the way back from the second tarp Gab and I paused to pull wrinkles out of it , and get it to sag properly into the furrows . The drainage ditch at the bottom of the fields was overflowing , but it all spilled into the river anyway . Tom came over to greet us . His sheltered face was as wet as anyone 's . “
25115	25318	25106	25106	Kathryn	293	” The four of us hurried up the riverbank to the cornfields , shivering and slapping our arms to our sides to drive out the chill . Kathryn was at their foot , running around getting groups together , booting reluctant rolls uphill , pointing out slack in the tarps already tied down . She was as black with mud as Gabby . She shouted instructions at us , and hearing that shrill tone in her voice we ran . The shoots of corn were about two hands high , and we could n't just lay the tarps right on them without breaking them . There were cement blocks every few yards , therefore , and the tarps had to be tied down to these through grommet holes . So the blocks had to be perfectly placed to match the holes . I saw that Steve and John Nicolin were working together , heaving blocks and tying knots . Everyone out there was dripping black . Kathryn had sent us to the upper end of the field , and when we got there we found her two youngest sisters and Doc and Carmen Eggloff , struggling with one of the narrowest tarps . “
25329	25337	25320	25320	Dad	335	” Mando said as we approached them . "
25342	25846	25106	25106	Kathryn	293	" Doc replied wearily . We got them to continue unrolling , while we tied the sides of the tarp down to the blocks . Kathryn had set the blocks out a few weeks before , and I was amazed at how close they were to their correct positions , but still every one had to be shifted a bit . It took a lot of slipping around in the mud to get them right . Finally we got that tarp 54 Kim Stanley Robinson down , and hurried to start on another one . A lot of time passed as we toiled up the slope again . Gusts of wind grabbed at the plastic and tore it away from my cold fingers . It hurt to hold on as hard as I had to . Tying the knots got almost impossible , and it was frustrating to watch my disobedient red and white fingers make mistakes again and again . My feet were long gone , of course . Thicker clouds flowed over , and it got darker . The spread tarps shone faintly . Kneeling in the muck and shivering , I looked up from a knot for a moment to see a field dotted with black figures , crouched or crawling or miserably bowed over , backs to the wind . I yanked the knot down grimly . By the time we got our third tarp down — we were not much of a team for speed — most of the cornfields were covered . We sloshed around our last tarp and down to the riverbank and Kathryn . The river took a torrey pine past us and under the bridge ; it looked forlorn , tumbling in the flood with its needles still green , its roots white and naked . Almost the whole crew had gathered by the drowned drainage channel : twenty of us or more , watching the Mendezes and Nicolins run around the tarps and crawl under them , tightening and letting slack and generally fooling with the raised tarps so they 'd drain properly . A few people made for the bathhouse ; the rest of us stood around under umbrellas describing the unrolling to each other . The fields were now glistening , ridged plastic surfaces , and the rain hitting the tarps leaped back into the air , a score of droplets jumping up from each raindrop that fell , so that the plastic itself was almost invisible under a layer of wild droplet mist . Sheets of water poured off the lower ends of the tarps into the drainage ditch , free of mud and our summer crops . It was a satisfying sight . When they were done adjusting the tarps we all trooped over the bridge to the bathhouse . Inside the big main room Rafael had been hard at work , it was already hot , and the baths were steaming . He was congratulated on his fire , "
25853	26297	25106	25106	Kathryn	293	" as Steve said . As I stripped my wet clothes off I admired for the hundredth time the complicated system of pipes and holding tanks and pumps that Rafael had constructed to heat the bath water . By the time I got in the dirt bath it was crowded . The dirt bath was the hotter of the two , and the air filled with the delighted moans and groans of scalded bathers . I could n't feel my feet , but the rest of me burned . THE WILD SHORE 55 Then the heat penetrated the skin of my feet and they felt like one of Pa 's pin cushions . I hooted loudly . The sheet metal of the bath bottom was hot to the touch , and most of us floated , bumping and splashing and discussing the storm . Rafe pumped away harder than ever , grinning like a frog . The clean bath had wooden seats anchored in it , and soon folks hopped over and gathered around those , talking and relaxing in the warmth . The boom of the rain on the corrugated metal roof washed over the chatter now and then ; the pitch of the boom was an exact sign of how hard the rain was falling , and when it deepened enough people stopped talking and listened . Some of the group had gone out to help spread the tarps before their own gardens were covered , and they had to put their clammy clothes back on ( unless they kept spares at the boathouse ) and leave , promising all the while that they would hurry back . We believed them . The firelight cast dancing shadows of the pipe system across the roof , and the plank walls glowed the color of the fire . Everyone 's skin was ruddy . The women were beautiful : Carmen Eggloff putting branches on the fire , the ribs of her back sticking out ; the girls diving like seals around one of the seats ; Kathryn standing before me to talk , thick and rounded , beads of water gleaming on her freckled skin ; Mrs. Nicolin twisting around and squealing , as John splashed her in a rare display of playfulness . I sat in my usual corner listening to Kathryn and looking around contentedly : we were a room of fire - skinned animals , wet and steaming , crazy - maned , beautiful as horses . Most of us were getting out , and Carmen was handing around her collection of towels , when a voice called from outside . “
26305	26321	25106	25106	Kathryn	293	" Talk stopped . In the silence ( roof drumming ) we heard it clearer : “
26342	26417	26340	26340	Americans	5454	” • Automatically the women , and most of the men , went for their towels or clothes . I yanked on my cold muddy pants , and followed Steve to the door . Tom and Nat Eggloff were already there ; Rafael joined us still naked , holding a pistol in his hand . John Nicolin bulled his way through us , still pulling up his shorts , and pushed out the door . “
26423	26538	26420	26420	you	1152	” we heard him ask . The answer was inaudible . A second passed , and Rafael opened the door again . Two men wearing ponchos entered before John ; they 56 Kim Stanley Robinson looked surprised to see Rafael . They were completely drenched , which made them look weary and bedraggled . One was a skinny man with a long nose and a black beard that was no more than a thin strip around his jaw . The other was short and stocky , wearing a soaked floppy hat under his poncho . They took the ponchos off , revealing dark coats and wet pants . The shorter man saw Tom and said “
26552	26555	26543	26543	We	1154	” Tom said “
26558	26642	26543	26543	We	1154	” They shook hands with him , and then with Rafael ( a funny sight ) , John , Nat , Steve , and me . Without showing it much they looked around the room . All the women were dressed , or wrapped in towels , leaving a room filled with a fire , and steaming baths , and several naked men gleaming like fish among those of us with some cloth on . The shorter man did a sort of bow . “
26663	26669	26656	26657	Mr. Barnard	340	" We stared at them . “
26677	26690	26671	26671	you	1156	” Tom asked . Both men nodded . The skinny one shivered . “
26701	26705	26691	26691	We	1154	” he said . “
26740	26741	26733	26733	we	1154	” “
26750	26756	26742	26742	We	1154	" the shorter one said , "
26763	26764	26742	26742	We	1154	” "
26777	26790	26791	26791	We	1154	" John Nicolin asked . After some hesitation the short one said , “
26808	26820	26791	26791	We	1154	” John tilted his head and squinted , not getting it . “
26831	26835	26791	26791	We	1154	" Tom said , “
26840	26849	26791	26791	We	1154	” Shaking his head the taller one said , “
26855	26862	26791	26791	We	1154	" They looked at each other . “
26866	26872	26791	26791	We	1154	” the short one observed . “
26875	26902	26791	26791	We	1154	” the other said , nodding a few times . He was still shivering . He looked around at us shyly , then said to Tom , "
26934	26935	26927	26927	I	0	” “
26950	26988	26948	26948	yours	1163	” John did n't look too happy at Tom 's wording , but he led the two men over to the fire , and Carmen threw on more wood . THE WILD SHORE 57 Steve nudged me . “
27008	27009	27012	27012	we	1154	" “
27015	27080	27012	27012	we	1154	" I replied . The men were introducing themselves : the taller one was Lee , the short one Jennings . Jennings took off his cap , revealing straggly blond hair , then removed his poncho , coat , shirt , boots , and socks . He laid his clothes over the drying racks and stood with his hands stretched out to the fire . “
27097	27118	27081	27081	We	1154	” he told us . Lee began to strip off his wet things as Jennings had . Jennings went on : “
27149	27150	27012	27012	we	1154	" "
27164	27168	27169	27169	I	0	" Tom asked . “
27177	27181	27182	27182	Jennings	249	“ About that . ”
27185	27301	27182	27182	Jennings	249	“ And since the Mayor began organizing things , we 've accomplished a good deal . The settlements are pretty well scattered , but we have a train system between them that works well . All handcars , you understand , although we do have generators providing a good supply of electricity back home . There 's a weekly swap meet , and a fishing fleet , and a militia — all manner of things there were n't before . Naturally Lee and I are proudest of the exploration team . Why , we cleared highway eight all the way across the mountains to the Salton Sea , and shifted the train tracks onto it . ”
27320	27329	27330	27330	Tom	351	" The Salton Sea must be huge now , "
27341	27371	27338	27338	Lee	341	“ It 's fresh water now , too , and filled with fish . People out there were doing pretty good , considering how few of them there were . ”
27372	27379	27380	27381	John Nicolin	278	“ What brings you up here ? ”
27422	27434	27435	27435	he	249	“ Well , we had the rails going up to Oceanside , ”
27438	27455	27435	27435	he	249	“ and the ruined tracks extended north of that , so we decided to repair them . ”
27456	27459	27460	27460	John	278	“ Why ? "
27479	27500	27501	27501	he	249	“ Why ? I guess you 'd have to ask the Mayor that one . It was his idea . You see"-
27512	27527	27501	27501	he	249	further—“you're all aware that the Japanese are guarding us on the west coast here ? ”
27528	27532	27533	27533	John	278	“ Of course , ”
27536	27543	27544	27544	Rafael	292	" You could hardly miss that , ”
27564	27576	27577	27577	Jennings	249	“ But I do n't mean from just the ships offshore , ”
27580	27590	27577	27577	Jennings	249	“ I mean from the sky . From satellites . ”
27591	27596	27597	27597	Tom	351	“ You mean cameras ? ”
27600	27610	27597	27597	Tom	351	" Sure . You 've all seen the satellites ? ”
27656	27671	27673	27673	Jennings	249	“ Those satellites carry cameras that can see things no bigger than a rat , ”
27675	27684	27673	27673	Jennings	249	“ They really got the eye on us . "
27691	27704	27705	27705	Lee	341	“ go to hell ! ' and they 'd read your lips , ”
27712	27717	27718	27718	Jennings	249	“ That 's right , ”
27721	27754	27718	27718	Jennings	249	“ And at night they have heat sensitive cameras that could pick up something as small as this roof , if you had the fire in here lit on a rainless night . ”
27786	27791	27792	27792	Doc	287	“ I told you , ”
27934	27957	27931	27931	John	278	“ Just how do you know that ? And what does that have to do with your coming this way , again ? ”
27958	27967	27968	27968	Jennings	249	“ We 've learned some things from Catalina , ”
27972	28017	27968	27968	Jennings	249	“ But that 's not the end of it . Apparently the Japs ' policy includes keeping our communities isolated . They do n't want reunification on any scale whatsoever . Why , when we THE WILD SHORE 59 built the tracks on highway eight east”-he
28022	28045	27931	27931	John	278	memory—“we built some bridges big and strong as you please . One night around sunset , wham . They blew them up . "
28046	28049	28050	28050	Tom	351	“ What ? ”
28063	28074	28075	28075	Jennings	249	“ They do n't do it in any big way , ”
28084	28111	28078	28078	Lee	341	" It 's true . Always at dusk - a red streak out of the sky , and thunk , it 's gone . No explosions . ”
28112	28116	28117	28117	Tom	351	“ Burnt up ? "
28123	28147	28120	28120	Lee	341	“ Tremendous heat . The tracks melt , the wood incinerates instantly . Sometimes things around will catch fire , but usually not . "
28148	28158	28159	28159	Jennings	249	" We do n't camp near our bridges much . ”
28162	28168	28159	28159	Jennings	249	“ As you can imagine . ”
28176	28258	28170	28171	no one	668	“ Anyway , when the Mayor found out about this , he got mad . He wanted to complete the tracks , no matter the bombings . Communications with other Americans is a God - given right ! he said . Since they got the upper hand for the time being , and will bomb us when they see us , we 'll just have to see to it that they do n't see us . That 's what he said . ”
28259	28265	28266	28266	Lee	341	" We work real light , ”
28272	28360	28266	28266	Lee	341	“ Most of the old pilings are still there for river bridges , and we just put beams across those and lay the rails across the beams . The handcars are light and do n't need much support . After we 've crossed we take the rails and beams across with us and hide them under trees , and there 's no sign we 've crossed . A few times for practice and we get so we can cross the easier rivers in a couple of hours . ”
28361	28370	28371	28371	Jennings	249	“ Of course sometimes it does n't work , ”
28374	28393	28371	28371	Jennings	249	" Once out near Julian we had bridge pilings burnt right to the water by those red streaks . ”
28394	28410	28411	28411	Lee	341	" Once they know we 're at it , they may keep a closer watch , "
28414	28458	28411	28411	Lee	341	“ We do n't know . They 're not consistent . Mayor says there may be disagreements on how to deal with us . Or spotty surveillance . So we ca n't predict very well . But we do n't camp near bridges . "
28508	28528	28503	28503	John	278	“ And now that you 've managed to get up here , what might your mayor want with us ? ”
28550	28644	28542	28542	Jennings	249	“ Why , to say hello , I reckon . To show that we can get to each other quick if we need to . And he was hoping we could convince you to send one of your valley 's officials to come down and talk about trade agreements and such . And then there 's the matter of extending the tracks farther north - we'd need your permission and cooperation to do that , of course . The Mayor is mighty anxious to establish tracks up to the Los Angeles basin . ' “
28656	28660	28661	28661	Our	1188	” Rafael said . "
28668	28673	28666	28666	officials	1190	” John said belligerently . “
28685	28690	28674	28674	Someone	5387	” Jennings said mildly . "
28702	28706	28691	28692	The Mayor	5274	” said Lee . “
28720	28725	28726	28726	We	1188	” No one answered . “
28740	28760	28734	28734	they	1194	” Steve had been nudging me so often that my ribs were sore ; now he almost busted them . “
28766	28774	28762	28762	you	1192	” he said in a fierce whisper . “
28794	28891	28791	28791	their	1197	” Kathryn and I shushed him so we could hear the rest of the discussion . Then there was an absence : the roof was silent . The rain had let up , at least for the moment . Those who wanted to go home dry inquired , and found that Lee and Jennings planned to stay for a day or two . So several people gathered their ponchos and boots and left . Tom invited the San Diegans to stay up at his place , and they quickly accepted . Pa came over to me . "
28905	28918	28791	28791	their	1197	” It looked like the talking was over , so I said , “
28924	29070	28791	28791	their	1197	” There was a sense of slowness and confusion to our departures . The strangers had told us so much we had never learned even at the swap meets that it filled our minds , and even finding the dry clothes that many kept at the bathhouse became difficult . I looked around ; after all the projects Lee and Jennings had listed the bathhouse did n't seem like much anymore . Pa and I got back into our wet clothes , as we had none to spare for the bathhouse , and we hurried home along the hissing brown river . By the time we got home it was drizzling again . We got the fire going good and sat in our beds as we ate our dried fish THE WILD SHORE 61 and tortillas , gabbing about the San Diegans and their train . "
29082	29086	29072	29072	they	1201	” I said . “
29112	29127	29100	29100	they	1201	" Bent tracks sticking off the cliff over the river marked where that was . “
29144	29146	29141	29141	Tom	351	" . "
29153	29158	29141	29141	Tom	351	" Pa said admiringly . "
29177	29178	29170	29170	You	1206	" “
29183	29427	29428	29428	Henry	284	" I fell asleep thinking of trains , and of bridges made of nothing but train tracks . The next morning I was fishing drowned greens out of our garden when I caught sight of Kathryn walking down the path , muddy once again , holding a bunch of scraggly young com stalks in her hand . She 'd been rolling up the tarps , and if they were up already , then she and her farm crew must have been at it since before first light , because they could never get as many people to help roll the tarps up as they could to put them down . Getting them back up was more or less their problem . And so of course Kathryn had just had a look at the damages . I could tell she was mad by the way she walked . The Mendezes ' dog ran out barking playfully at her and she swung a foot at it with a curse . The dog slipped avoiding her boot and yelped , then ran back to its garden . Kathryn stood in the path cursing , and then kicked the base of the big eucalyptus with her heavy boot , thump thump thump thump . I decided to pass on saying good morning to her . I could talk to her some other time . She walked on , cursing still . Tom appeared from the other direction . “
29430	29455	29456	29456	Henry	284	” he called . I waved to him as he approached . He stood looking down at me with a twinkle in his eye . “
29469	29470	29460	29460	you	284	” “
29473	29477	29460	29460	you	284	” I cried . “
29485	29499	29500	29500	I	0	” He laughed and sat down on the barrel half in our yard . “
29556	29557	29549	29549	I	0	” “
29562	29568	29549	29549	I	0	" I stalked around him . “
29573	29574	29575	29575	I	0	” "
29591	29592	29588	29589	your pa	5291	” "
29596	29625	29588	29589	your pa	5291	" Pa said , looking around the corner of the house . 62 Kim Stanley Robinson He grinned , came around the corner carrying two buckets of water . "
29632	29633	29588	29589	your pa	5291	” “
29638	29642	29636	29636	Sky	346	" Tom said , “
29654	29733	29643	29643	I	0	” Pa put down the buckets and pulled his moustache while Tom told him about it . They wrangled over the value of a week of my work , both agreeing it was n't much , but differing over just how little it was , until they 'd worked out an agreement whereby Tom rented my services for whatever it took him to get a sewing machine that Pa had seen at the swap meet two months ago . “
29746	29750	29744	29744	Sky	346	” said Tom . “
29753	29757	29744	29744	Sky	346	” Pa said . “
29769	29785	29760	29760	Rafe	292	" And Tom was to deal with John Nicolin concerning my absence from the fishing . “
29788	29792	29760	29760	Rafe	292	” I said . “
29802	29815	29793	29793	You	292	" Tom looked at me . Fingering his beard , he said , “
29825	29827	29820	29820	I	0	” . “
29830	29833	29820	29820	I	0	” said Pa. "
29916	29966	29967	29967	Tom	351	” I agreed , and soon I was off running to the cliffs , singing San Diego , Sandy Dandy - ay - go . On the beach I shut up , and spent the afternoon fishing as usual . When we were back ashore I said to John , “
29997	29998	29981	29981	He	1218	” “
30007	30015	30017	30017	him	1218	” John said in his abrupt way . "
30023	30027	30017	30017	him	1218	” he added . “
30039	30041	30035	30035	You	1220	” . "
30047	30192	30045	30045	sir	1218	” I said . With a mysterious wink at Steve I was off up the cliff . I ran the river path home , splashing every puddle . To San Diego ! To San Diego by train ! Chapter Five Late that afternoon the old man and I walked down the river path to the Nicolins ' . The valley cupped us like a green bowl , tilted to spill us into the sea . The air smelled of wet earth and wet trees . Overhead crows cawed and dipped and lazily flapped their ways home . Above them there was n't a cloud in the sky ; nothing but that pure dome of early evening blue . Naturally we were in high spirits . We skipped over puddles , cracked jokes , and described to each other the dinner we were headed for . “
30197	30203	30193	30193	I	0	” the old man declared . “
30206	30226	30227	30227	I	0	” He waved at Marvin Hamish and Nat Eggloff , who were fishing over a pool across the river . "
30241	30242	30234	30234	you	0	” “
30252	30253	30234	30234	you	0	” “
30263	30443	30257	30257	I	0	” We turned off the river path and climbed the trail leading to the Nicolins ' house . Once over the freeway we could see it through the trees . It was the biggest house in the valley , set on a fine patch 63 64 Kim Stanley Robinson of cleared land just behind the highest part of the beach cliff . The yard around the house had been planted with canyon grass , and the two - story , tile - roofed building stood on its green lawn ( well apart from the storage shed and the doghouses and the chicken coop ) like something left over from the old time . There were shutters bracketing glass windows , big eaves over the doors , and a brick chimney . Smoke lofted from this chimney into the river - blue sky , and lamps glowed in the windows . Tom and I gave each other a look , and went to pump the door knocker . Before we got there Mrs. Nicolin threw the door open , crying , “
30465	30466	30451	30451	you	1223	" "
30471	30475	30469	30469	Christy	350	" Tom said . “
30491	30492	30616	30616	they	1225	" "
30497	30610	30616	30616	they	1225	" Mrs. Nicolin said , pulling back a loose strand of her thick black hair . But Tom was telling the truth ; Christy Nicolin had a beautiful face , strong and kind , and she was tall and rangy , even after bearing seven kids . Steve took a lot of his features from her rather than from John : his height , his sharp - edged nose and jaw , his mouth . Now she waved us in the door past her , shaking her head at the ceiling to show us , as she always did , that her day had been too harried to be described or imagined . “
30635	30772	30619	30619	They	1225	” Their house had a dozen or more rooms , but only the dining room had a giant set of windows facing west , so despite Mrs. Nicolin 's protests it got used for everything that needed good light , especially when the yard was wet . All of the rooms we passed on our way through the front of the house had fine furniture in them , beds and tables and chairs that John and Teddy , Steve 's twelve - year - old brother , had built in imitation of old time stuff . To me the whole house looked like something right out of books , and when I had said that to Tom he had agreed , saying it was more like houses used to be than any he 'd ever seen : “
30802	30897	31033	31033	he	351	" When we got to the dining room the kids ran out of it yelling . Mrs. Nicolin sighed and led us in . John and Teddy were sweeping up splinters and chunks of wood . Tom and John shook THE WILD SHORE 65 hands , something they would n't do unless one was visiting the other in his home . Through the big west windows we had a good view out to sea . Sunlight slanted in and lit the bottom of the east wall , and the wood dust in the air . “
30903	30978	31033	31033	he	351	" Mrs. Nicolin ordered . She pulled a hand through her hair , as if just standing in the room was making her dirty . John lifted his eyebrows in mock surprise , and tossed a scrap of wood in her direction . I left and went through the kitchen , which was stuffy with good smells , to find Steve . He was out back , cleaning the inside of the new churn . “
30983	31005	31006	31006	Jennings	249	” he asked . I decided to tell him , as I could n't think of any way to avoid it . “
31040	31050	31033	31033	he	351	" Steve let the churn fall to the grass . “
31059	31063	31033	31033	he	351	" I nodded . “
31071	31096	31033	31033	he	351	" He leaped over the churn , wiggled his arms in his victory shimmy dance . Suddenly he stopped and turned to examine me . "
31104	31105	31033	31033	he	351	” “
31113	31128	31110	31110	Tom	351	” His eyes narrowed , and his wide mobile mouth became straight and tight . “
31134	31135	31136	31136	I	0	” "
31164	31439	31440	31441	Mrs. N.	356	" He picked up the churn again , and thumped the last chips out of it . . Soon Mrs. Nicolin called us all into the dining room , and got us seated around the big oak table : John and her at the head , her grandmother Marie , who was ninety - five and simple - minded , Tom , Steve and Teddy and Emilia , who was thirteen , and very quiet and shy ; then me , and then the kids , Virginia and Joe the twins , and Carol and Judith , the babies of the family , back around the table next to Mrs. N. John lit the lamps on the table , while Mrs. N. and Emilia brought in the food . The yellow lamplight was in sharp contrast to the blue evening outside . Faint reflections of us all sprang to in the big west window . Emilia and Mrs. N. brought out plate after plate , until the tabletop was nearly invisible under them . Tom and I kicked each other under the table . Several of the plates were covered , and when John took off their tops steam puffed out , fragrant with the smell of chicken bubbling in a red sauce . There was 66 Kim Stanley Robinson a cabbage salad in a large wooden bowl , and soup in a porcelain tureen . There were plates of bread and tortillas , and plates covered with sliced tomatoes and eggs . There were jugs of goat 's milk and water . All of the smells made me drunk , and I said , “
31485	31496	31497	31497	He	357	” The Nicolins laughed at me , and Tom said , “
31512	31623	31503	31504	The Irish	1237	” We passed the plates around following Mrs. Nicolin 's orders , and when our plates were piled high we started eating , and it was quiet for a time , except for the clink of cutlery on plates and bowls . Soon enough Marie wanted to talk to Tom , for she just picked at her chicken and greens . Tom bolted his food so quicklynever stopping to chew , it seemed - that he had time to talk between bites , and while he refilled his plate . Marie was pleased to see Tom , who was one of the few people outside the family she regularly recognized . “
31626	31631	31501	31501	Christy	350	” she piped loudly , “
31638	31669	31501	31501	Christy	350	” . Virginia and Joe giggled . Tom snapped down a chunk of chicken like it was bread , leaned over and spoke directly into Marie 's nearly deaf ear : “
31675	31690	31673	31673	Marie	351	” Marie blinked wisely and nodded , while across from Tom Virginia giggled again . “
31707	31708	31673	31673	Marie	351	" “
31714	31720	31673	31673	Marie	351	” Mrs. N. said automatically . “
31726	31727	31673	31673	Marie	351	" “
31732	31742	31673	31673	Marie	351	” Tom gobbled down some of the fish soup . “
31748	31749	31673	31673	Marie	351	" "
31754	31755	31756	31756	Marie	351	" “
31764	31765	31756	31756	Marie	351	” “
31776	31777	31766	31766	She	1238	" “
31784	31785	31766	31766	She	1238	” “
31788	31798	31801	31801	Marie	351	" Marie cried , sensing the talk concerned her . “
31803	31810	31801	31801	Marie	351	" Tom said in her ear . “
31819	31820	31813	31813	she	1238	" "
31823	31828	31813	31813	she	1238	” Mrs. N. warned . “
31865	31870	31871	31871	You	0	” THE WILD SHORE 67 “
31878	31879	31871	31871	You	0	” “
31905	31921	31900	31900	we	1239	” He swallowed some more chicken , licking the sauce out of his moustache luxuriously . “
31942	31943	31944	31944	Yooks	359	” “
31948	31949	31944	31944	Yooks	359	” “
31952	31953	31944	31944	Yooks	359	” "
31958	31959	31944	31944	Yooks	359	” “
31964	32128	31944	31944	Yooks	359	” John growled , looking up from his plate . I saw Steve wince a little . He had n't said a word since we came inside , even when his mother talked directly at him . It made me a little apprehensive , but to tell the truth I was distracted by the food . I had started too quickly , and now I slowed down , chewing each mouthful into nothing but its taste . There were so many different flavors , aromas , textures ; each forkful of food had a different taste to it , and a mouthful of water after each swallow made my tongue fresh for more . I was getting full , but I could n't stop . John began to slow down , and talked to no one in particular about the warm current that had hit the coast with the previous day 's rain . Tom was still tossing it down , and Virginia said “
32140	32162	32138	32138	Tom	352	” He heard that one a lot , but he smiled at Virginia all the same , and the kids laughed . “
32168	32174	32138	32138	Tom	352	” Mrs. N. urged me , “
32179	32180	31944	31944	Yooks	359	” “
32185	32227	31944	31944	Yooks	359	” I replied . Little Carol started to cry , and Emilia got up to sit by her and spoon some soup into her mouth , or try to . It was getting pretty noisy , and Marie noticed and cried , “
32234	32302	31944	31944	Yooks	359	" which she knew would get her a laugh . Meanwhile Steve continued to eat silently , and I saw John notice it . I took another swallow of milk to reassure myself that everything would go all right . Over the remains of the meal we talked and nibbled equally . When Carol was calmed Emilia got up and started taking out dishes to the kitchen . “
32309	32356	31944	31944	Yooks	359	” Mrs. N. reminded Steve . Without a word he got up and carried plates away . When the table was almost cleared they brought out berries and cream , and another jug of milk . Tom kicked me , and flapped his eyebrows like wings . “
32362	32483	32360	32360	Christy	350	” he said piously . After we had feasted on berries and cream the kids were allowed to take Gran and scamper off , and John and Mrs. N. , 68 Kim Stanley Robinson Steve and Emilia and Tom and I sat back in our chairs , shifting them around to face the window . John got a bottle of brandy from a cabinet , and we contemplated our reflections as we sipped . We made a funny picture . Steve was n't talking tonight , and Emilia never talked , so the conversation was left to Tom and John , mostly , with an occasional word from Mrs. N. or me . John speculated some more about the current . “
32525	32581	32625	32625	they	1247	” None of us ventured a theory ( I was surprised to see Tom pass on an opportunity to discuss the weather ) , and we sat in silence . Mrs. N. began to knit , and Emilia wordlessly moved over to hold the yarn . Suddenly John knocked back the rest of his brandy . “
32591	32603	32585	32585	you	1246	” he asked Tom . The old man sipped his brandy . “
32697	32698	32691	32691	I	0	” “
32708	32713	32700	32700	they	1247	” Steve said darkly . “
32716	32720	32700	32700	they	1247	" Tom replied . “
32785	32791	32792	32792	I	0	" John shook his head . “
32801	32815	32792	32792	I	0	" The corners of Steve 's mouth went white . Tom said casually , “
32882	32883	32884	32884	Steve	351	" “
32886	32894	32884	32884	Steve	351	” John glared at the old man . "
32897	32908	32884	32884	Steve	351	" He glanced at Steve , looked back at Tom . “
32920	32925	32884	32884	Steve	351	” THE WILD SHORE 69 "
32934	32939	32926	32926	You	0	” Steve burst out . "
32961	32963	32926	32926	You	0	" . "
32966	33028	33029	33029	Steve	351	" John said in his on - the - water voice . In the next room the sounds of the kids playing abruptly died . Steve had stood up , and now he jerked toward his father , who was still leaning back in his chair ; Steve 's hands were balled into fists , and his face was twisted up . “
33031	33049	33029	33029	Steve	351	” Mrs. Nicolin said quietly . John shifted in his chair to better stare up at Steve . "
33104	33106	33107	33107	I	0	” . "
33117	33239	33110	33110	someone	5387	” Steve said desperately . But John just shook his head , the grim set of his mouth shifting to an angry down - curve . I shrank in my chair , frightened . So often it came to this between them ; they got right to the breaking point so fast that it seemed certain they would snap through one day . For a moment I was sure of it ; Steve 's hands clenched , John was ready to launch himself .... But once again Steve deferred . He turned on his heel and ran out the dining room . We heard the kitchen door slam open and shut . Mrs. Nicolin got up and refilled John 's glass . “
33256	33257	33260	33260	Christy	350	” "
33279	33294	33274	33274	People	5352	" He glanced at Tom , drank deeply , said in an annoyed voice , “
33318	33324	33306	33306	you	351	” ' Tom said mildly , “
33335	33336	33327	33327	you	351	” “
33339	33353	33327	33327	you	351	" John said for the last time , putting his bulk into it . "
33363	33365	33361	33361	Tom	351	” . “
33374	33505	33370	33370	I	0	” Tom sipped his brandy and gave me an uncomfortable look . I imitated Emilia and pretended I was n't there , staring at the portrait of us all on the black glass of the window . We were a pretty unhappy looking group . The silence stretched on ; we heard the kids laughing at the other end of the house . Steve was long gone , on the beach , I figured . I thought about how he felt at that moment , and the fine meal in my stomach turned lumpy . Mrs. Nicolin , face tight with distress , tried to refill our glasses . I shook my head , and Tom covered his glass with his hand . He cleared his throat . Kim Stanley Robinson "
33519	33523	33512	33512	I	0	” We stood . “
33529	33557	33527	33527	Christy	350	" Tom muttered to Mrs. N. She began to say goodbye as if nothing had happened ; Tom cut her off with a pained expression and said , “
33574	33617	33568	33568	I	0	” John grunted and waved a hand , lost in his thoughts . We all stood looking at him , a big man brooding in his chair , staring at his own colorless image , surrounded by all his goods and possessions .... “
33621	33630	33631	33631	I	0	" he said , as if releasing us . “
33655	33656	33657	33657	We	1266	” “
33660	33684	33657	33657	We	1266	” Tom thanked Mrs. N. again and we backed out the door . She followed us out . On the doorstep she said , “
33692	33693	33690	33690	Tom	351	” “
33702	33734	33700	33700	Christy	350	" We walked up the river path full of food , but glum and heavy - footed . Tom muttered under his breath and took swings at branches near the path . “
33753	33759	33785	33785	you	1265	" He raised his voice . “
33790	33791	33785	33785	you	1265	” “
33794	33795	33785	33785	you	1265	” “
33798	33807	33808	33808	I	0	" He started muttering again , sounding disgusted . “
33822	33823	33785	33785	you	1265	” “
33827	33834	33785	33785	you	1265	" Tom snapped . I did . “
33841	33859	33785	33785	you	1265	" he went on . Suddenly he stopped and grabbed my arm , swung me around violently . “
33864	33877	33785	33785	you	1265	" he cried , pointing across the river at the other bank . “
33880	33889	33785	33785	you	1265	" I protested , peering into the dark . “
33972	33978	33951	33952	John Junior	361	" His voice was harsh . “
34037	34042	34070	34070	Steve	351	" THE WILD SHORE 71 “
34045	34062	34070	34070	Steve	351	" I said , uneasy at the strain in his voice . We started walking again . “
34078	34080	34070	34070	Steve	351	" . "
34084	34111	34070	34070	Steve	351	” he said again , not as sharp as the first time . After a few steps he said quietly , as if talking to himself , “
34129	34130	34122	34122	We	1279	” “
34138	34201	34131	34131	I	0	” I said , irritated that he kept going back to the past . That was all we heard about : the past , the past , the God damned past . The explanation for everything that happened was contained in our past . A man could behave like a tyrant to his son , and what was his excuse ? History . "
34213	34283	34206	34206	you	0	" he told me , irritated himself . Watching him in the dark I saw marks of the past on him : the scars , the caved - in side of his face where he had no teeth left , his bent back . He reminded me of one of the trees high on the hills above us , gnarled by the constant onshore winds , riven by lightning . “

34458	34467	34493	34494	John Nicolin	278	” He snorted , spat at the river . “
34556	34589	34590	34590	He	278	" Well , Nicolin had the answer . He went up into Clemente and looked in a telephone book , for God 's sake . Looked in the God damned yellow pages . ”
34599	34704	34590	34590	He	278	“ He found the listing for commercial fishing warehouses , took some men up there to look for them . First one 72 Kim Stanley Robinson we found was empty . Second one had been blown flat on the day . The third one we walked into was a warehouse full of nets . Steel cables , heavy nylon — it was great . And that was just the start . We used the phone book and map to find the boatyards in Orange County , because all of the harbors were clean empty , and we hauled some boats right down the freeway . "
34705	34711	34755	34755	he	1291	“ What about the scavengers ? ”
34712	34736	34590	34590	He	278	" That was when there were n't too many scavengers , and there was n't any fight in the ones that were there . "
35033	35040	35041	35041	Rafe	292	“ One thing 's for sure , ”
35044	35075	35041	35041	Rafe	292	“ I walked with him by one of the scavengers ' geiger counters at a swap meet once , and that machine almost busted its bell . Scavengers took off .... "
35076	35079	35080	35080	Tom	351	“ Anyway , ”
35087	35238	35080	35080	Tom	351	" John Nicolin did or directed everything that had to do with fishing , and doing it was what brought the people in this valley together , and made us a town . The second winter after he arrived was the first one no one died from hunger . Boy , you do n't know what that means . We ate dried fish till we were dead sick of it , but THE WILD SHORE 73 no one was dead dead . There 's been hard times since , but none to match those before Nicolin arrived . I admire him . So if he 's got fish on the brain , if he wo n't let his son leave it for a week or even a day , then that 's too bad . That 's the way he is now , and you 've got to understand it . ”
35239	35259	35357	35357	Tom	351	“ But it does n't matter how well fed he is , if he makes his son hate him . "
35260	35328	35329	35329	I	0	" Aye . But that 's not his intention . I know he does n't intend that . Remember John Junior . Could be , even if John himself does n't know it , he just wants to keep Steve where he can see him . To try and keep him safe . So that even the fishing is just a cover . I do n't know . ”
35424	35431	35433	35433	Tom	351	“ Steve'll make it another time , "
35435	35452	35433	35433	Tom	351	“ But us — we 'll be off to San Diego on the next cloudy night . ”
35453	35456	35468	35468	Tom	351	“ Yeah . "
35479	35483	35484	35484	he	351	“ Be ready ! ”
35623	35655	35618	35618	he	351	“ Just when you do n't want clear days they come blaring down . Come on , let 's use this one for what it was meant to be used for . ”

36173	36179	36126	36126	she	309	" Just me and Tom . ”

36189	36202	36126	36126	she	309	“ Oh they 're going too . They 're taking us down . ”
36207	36216	36126	36126	she	309	“ Just those two who came up here ? ”
36217	36239	36240	36240	I	0	“ No , they have a whole crew of men waiting down the freeway where they stopped fixing up the tracks . "

38144	38154	38155	38159	The men on both cars	1418	“ We know it ai n't Jennings doing that ! ”
38164	38169	38170	38172	one of them	5447	“ It is Jennings , "

38210	38222	38170	38172	one of them	5447	“ Throw us a tow rope if you feel that good ! ”
38223	38229	38230	38230	Lee	341	“ Slow it down some , ”
38236	38256	38230	38230	Lee	341	" We got a ways to go , do n't want to tire out those poor men back there . "
38418	38425	38426	38426	Jennings	249	“ Now comes the complicated part , ”
38561	38568	38569	38569	Jennings	249	“ That 's our bridge foundation , ”
38585	38607	38577	38577	Lee	341	“ It 's all that 's left of the old bridge , which must have burned when the water was high . ”
38608	38618	38619	38619	Tom	351	“ More likely the Pendleton bomb knocked it down , "
38622	38635	38619	38619	Tom	351	“ I doubt the river was ever higher than it is now . ”
38636	38644	38645	38645	Jennings	249	" You 've got a point there , ”
38648	38732	38645	38645	Jennings	249	“ Anyway , the pilings are in pretty good shape . We leveled them , and brought up some beams that sit over the pilings sideways , like lintels . Then we set rail over the beams at the right gauge , and roll the cars over , and haul all the beams and rail to the other bank after us . It 's a lot of work , but with the material hidden no one can tell we 're crossing this bridge . ”
38733	38737	38738	38738	Tom	351	“ Very ingenious , "
38966	38997	38961	38961	Lee	341	“ Someone 's going to have to swim over and clear that pulley . We ca n't mess with carrying the beams out ; they 're too heavy to carry . ”

39119	39123	39124	39124	Jennings	249	“ Good man , ”
39128	39188	39124	39124	Jennings	249	“ You see , Henry , we 've swum this river many times , but it 's not easy . You 're best off pulling yourself over with the rope ; that way you wo n't be carried downstream . Just get over there and clear that pulley , and we 'll have this bridge up in no time . ”

40146	40162	40163	40163	Tom	351	" The first time they did this it must have been a lot of trouble , "
40180	40205	40163	40163	Tom	351	“ I guess it must hold those cars , but I sure would n't have wanted to be the first to take one across . "
40206	40217	40218	40218	I	0	" They look like they know what they 're doing , "
40221	40244	40218	40218	I	0	“ Yeah . Tough work in the dark . Too bad they ca n't just build a bridge and leave it there . "
40245	40259	40260	40260	I	0	“ That 's what I was thinking . I ca n't believe the ... "
40269	40282	40260	40260	I	0	“ That they 'd actually bomb a little bridge like this one . "
40283	40287	40292	40292	Tom	351	" I know . ”
40298	40349	40350	40350	Jennings	249	“ But I do n't think these folks are lying , or going to all this trouble for nothing . I guess whoever 's up there is keeping the existing communities separated , like Jennings said . But I was n't aware of it . It 's a bad sign . ”
40365	40370	40371	40371	he	249	“ Just about done , ”
40374	40405	40371	40371	he	249	“ You men should walk across now . We take the cars over as empty as we can get them , although it 's just a precaution , you understand . ”
40406	40411	40413	40413	Tom	351	" That we do , "
40515	40587	40503	40503	Jennings	249	“ It 's true . We ca n't keep those ties perfectly flat . It makes for a little yaw when you cross , but nothing worse than that . At least not so far . We 'll see if Lee has to go for a swim like you did when he brings the first car over . I hope not — it 's still a fair walk to San Diego . ”
40702	40706	40699	40700	the men	772	“ All right , ”
40708	40715	40699	40700	the men	772	“ That was a good one , ”

41185	41190	41191	41191	Lee	341	“ Kill the lanterns , ”
41251	41265	41266	41266	Jennings	249	“ They do n't come so close to the land in inhabited areas , "
41276	41283	41266	41266	Jennings	249	“ That was a rare sighting . ”
41707	41711	41712	41712	Jennings	249	“ San Elijo , ”
41788	41806	41785	41785	Tom	351	“ How do you cross it ? Pretty long bridge to build , would n't you say ? "
41810	41828	41807	41807	Jennings	249	“ We go around it . We 've set rails on the roads permanently . Down here they "
41833	41838	41807	41807	Jennings	249	skyward—“don't seem to mind . "
41879	41899	41900	41900	Tom	351	“ Have you been able to determine how far away from San Diego you can build without disturbing them ? ”
41930	41978	41922	41922	Lee	341	“ Lee here has a theory that there are very strict and regular limits to what we can do before they intervene - a matter of isolating each of the old counties , to the extent they can . Is n't that what you said , Lee ? "
41994	42011	42012	42012	Jennings	249	“ Me , I 'm not so sure I do n't agree more with the Mayor , ”
42022	42072	42012	42012	Jennings	249	“ The Mayor says there is no rhyme nor reason to what they do ; madmen watch us from space , he says , and control what we can and ca n't do . He really gets upset . We 're like flies to the gods , he says . ”
42073	42086	42094	42094	Madmen	5967	“ ‘ Like flies to wanton boys are we to the gods , ”
42087	42091	42094	42094	Madmen	5967	” Tom corrected . "
42101	42107	42094	42094	Madmen	5967	" Lee shook his head . “
42161	42180	42185	42185	they	5967	" But there he stopped himself , frowning as if he felt he had gone on too long . “
42195	42200	42185	42185	they	5967	” Jennings disagreed complacently . “
42343	42572	42339	42339	you	1571	” We were rolling through a thick forest of torrey pine . The sun split the shadows and sparked the dew . The air warmed and I felt drowsy again , despite my fascination with the new country we were passing through . Among the trees were groups of houses from the old time , many of them restored and occupied ; smoke rose from many a chimney . When I saw this I nudged Tom , powerfully disturbed . These San Diegans were nothing else but scavengers ! Tom saw what I meant , but he just shook his head briefly at me . It was n't the time to discuss it , that was sure . But it made me uneasy . The tracks led to a village somewhat like ours , except there were more houses , and they were placed closer together , and many of them had been built in the old time . The screech of our brakes sent chickens cackling and dogs howling , and it made me grind my teeth . Several men and women emerged from a big house across the clearing from the tracks . The San Diegans jumped off the cars and greeted the locals . In the light of day they looked filthy and red - eyed and whiskery , but no one seemed to mind . “
42578	42591	42339	42339	you	1571	” Jennings said to us as he helped Tom off the car . “
42609	42718	42721	42722	the Mayor	5274	” We agreed heartily to that , and I realized I was as hungry as I was tired , or even more so . We were introduced to the group who had come from the big house to greet us , and we followed them into it . Inside the front door was an entryway two stories tall , carpeted red , with red and gold wallpaper on the walls , and a glass candle holder hanging from the ceiling . The staircase against one wall was carpeted as well , and it had a bannister of carved and varnished oak . Wide - eyed , I said , “
42726	42755	42721	42722	the Mayor	5274	” The San Diegans erupted with laughter . I felt my cheeks burn . Jennings put his arm around my shoulders with a whoop . THE WILD SHORE 91 “
42821	42889	42893	42893	quick	1583	” -- - - - - … . - … . -- - - . ... -- -- - -- - - - - - - - -- - - Chapter Seven • After breakfast Tom and I slept for most of the day , on old couches in the Jennings ' front room . Late in the day Jennings bustled in and woke us , saying , “
42925	42926	42916	42916	he	5274	” “
42935	42961	42916	42916	he	5274	” Jennings ' wife said as she looked over his shoulder at us . She looked remarkably like him , short , thick and cheerful . “
42974	43144	42966	42966	I	0	” Tom and I followed her to it , and relieved ourselves in a working water toilet . When we were done Jennings hustled us outside . Lee and the short man were already on one of the train cars . We joined them , and they pumped us south . Apparently in the light of day the tubby man felt more sociable , and he introduced himself as Abe Tonklin . We rattled over tracks laid on the cracked concrete of another freeway , under a canopy of torrey pine and eucalyptus , redwood and oak . The car crunched swiftly through alternating shadows and slanted beams of sunlight , and now and then we 93 94 Kim Stanley Robinson iPi passed a big clearing in the forest , packed with crops , usually corn . Once I waved at a man standing in one of these yellowy green expanses , and then realized he was a scarecrow . Over the roar of wheel on rail Jennings shouted , “
43150	43360	42966	42966	I	0	” We topped a rise and below us was a narrow lake , stretching right to left in front of us . It was as if a marsh similar to the ones to the north had flooded . Scattered on the lake 's surface were towering buildings , skyscrapers , at least a dozen of them . One of them , to the left , was a giant circular wall . And in the middle of the lake stood a piece of freeway , up on concrete pilings above the water . A white house stood on this platform . Flying above this house I could make out a little American flag , snapping in the breeze . I looked at Tom , my mouth hanging open in amazement . Tom 's eyes were big . I took in the sight again . Flanked by forested hills , lit by the low sun , the long lake and its fantastic collection of drowned and ruined giants was the most impressive remnant of the old time I had ever laid eyes on . They were so big ! Once again I had that feeling like a hand squeezing my heart — that I knew what it had been like . ... "
43369	43373	43364	43365	the Mayor	5274	” Jennings said . "
43382	43386	43375	43375	God	251	" Tom said . “
43391	43603	43604	43604	You	1590	” Jennings replied , as proudly as if he 'd made it all himself . Tom shook his head and laughed in a dumbfounded way . The tracks came to an end , and Lee braked the car with the usual nerve - jangling screech . We got off and followed the San Diegans down the freeway . It led right into the lake and disappeared . The piece of freeway standing on stilts in the lake 's center was on a line with it , and in a notch of the hills forming the opposite shore I saw the gray concrete rising out of the lake again . All at once I understood that the section of freeway on stilts in the lake was all that was left of a bridge that had spanned the whole valley . Rather than have their road dip into the valley and rise again , they had placed it on towers for well over a mile , from hillside to hillside — just to avoid a drop and rise for their cars ! I was stunned ; I stared at it ; I could n't get a grasp on the sort of thinking that would even imagine such a bridge . It was unbelievable . “
43607	43612	43604	43604	You	1590	” Lee asked me . "
43625	43626	43375	43375	God	251	” "
43643	43726	43375	43375	God	251	” This was as friendly as Lee had been to me , and I THE WILD SHORE 95 saw that he appreciated my astonishment . Where the road plunged into the lake a large floating dock moored a score of rowboats and small catboats . Lee and Abe led us to one of the larger rowboats . We got in , and Abe rowed us toward the freeway island . As we got closer Jennings answered Tom 's questions about the lake : “
43815	43819	43852	43852	they	1599	” Tom laughed . “
43843	43844	43852	43852	they	1599	” “

44100	44105	44106	44106	Lee	341	“ We 're late , ”
44109	44114	44106	44106	Lee	341	“ Let 's go . ”
44518	44526	44527	44527	he	5274	“ Jennings , who are these men ? ”
44573	44577	44578	44579	the Mayor	5274	“ Timothy Danforth , "
44584	44591	44578	44579	the Mayor	5274	“ Mayor of this fine town . ”
44663	44677	44658	44658	He	351	“ I am told you are not the elected leader of San Onofre ? ”
44678	44687	44688	44688	Tom	351	“ Onofre does n't have an elected leader , "
44691	44700	44701	44702	the Mayor	5274	“ But you hold some sort of authority ? "
44720	44728	44729	44729	he	351	“ Nice view you 've got here , ”
44807	44815	44816	44817	the Mayor	5274	“ Always good to meet another neighbor , "
44825	44847	44816	44817	the Mayor	5274	" We 'll celebrate with a meal out here , if you like . It should be a warm enough evening . ”
44866	44880	44881	44881	His	5274	“ Tell me , are you one who lived in the old time ? ”
44899	44905	44906	44906	Tom	351	“ How did you guess ? "
44924	44958	44918	44918	Danforth	368	“ It 's an honor to meet you , sir . There are n't many of you left , especially in such good health . You 're an inspiration to all of us . "
44966	44969	44960	44960	Tom	351	“ Really ? ”
44970	44974	44975	44976	the Mayor	5274	“ An inspiration , "
44980	45018	44975	44976	the Mayor	5274	“ A monument , so to speak . A reminder of what we 're striving for in these most difficult of times . I find that old timers like you understand better what we 're striving for . "
45020	45024	45026	45026	Tom	351	“ Which is ? ”
45056	45063	45064	45064	he	5274	“ Well , come sit down , ”

45546	45559	45542	45542	I	0	“ I was anxious to get down here and see this town . "
45595	45611	45612	45613	the Mayor	5274	“ What 's the shortest time it would take you to train up to Onofre ? "
45702	45739	45697	45697	Lee	341	“ Last night it took about eight hours , from our stopping point up there to University City . That 's about as fast as it could be done , unless we left the bridges up . ”
45740	45747	45748	45748	Danforth	368	“ We ca n't do that . ”
45755	45782	45748	45748	Danforth	368	" I guess not . Anyway , another fifteen minutes to Onofre . The track 's in good shape to there . ' THE WILD SHORE 99 “
45788	45802	45748	45748	Danforth	368	” Jennings added , which made Tom look up . The Mayor scowled . “
45811	45870	45697	45697	Lee	341	" he said . After the girls had set the tables , with plates and glasses and cloth napkins and silverware that looked like real silver , they brought out big glass bowls filled with salads made of lettuce and shrimp . Tom examined the shrimp with interest , forking one to get it closer to his eyes . “
45877	45885	45873	45873	you	1703	” he inquired . The Mayor laughed . “
45899	45955	45893	45893	Ben	369	" All the serving girls came out and stood still , and the Mayor stood and walked to the rail , so he could be seen from below . He had a limp , I noticed ; his left foot would n't bend . We all bowed our heads . The Mayor declaimed the prayer : “
45988	46038	46039	46039	We	1704	" Everyone joined in on the amen , which covered the little choking sounds Tom was making beside me . I ribbed him hard . We started in on the salad . From below voices chimed with the sounds of clinking dishes . Between bites Ben said to Tom , “
46047	46048	46039	46039	We	1704	” “

46222	46226	46219	46220	the Japs	343	” Danforth said . “

46321	46330	46312	46312	Tom	351	" Sure . Do n't you like it ? ”

46339	46349	46312	46312	Tom	351	" Gun parts , mostly . Souvenirs . Junk . ”
46350	46355	46356	46356	Danforth	368	“ Mexicans love junk , ”
46364	46387	46388	46388	He	1724	“ But we 'll sell them something different someday . Put them back where they belong , like it used to be . ”

46418	46433	46388	46388	He	1724	“ Up in Orange County , mostly . I came down here to school . "
46434	46441	46403	46403	he	1724	“ Changed , has n't it ? "
46442	46445	46446	46446	Tom	351	" Sure . ”

46705	46709	46710	46710	Tom	351	" That so ? "

46824	46827	46828	46828	Tom	351	" They ? ”
46835	46867	46828	46828	Tom	351	" Mostly Japanese , although there are other nationalities too . But the Japanese , who were given the charter to guard our west coast , make up most of them . "
46868	46875	46876	46876	Tom	351	“ Who guards the other coasts ? ”
46889	46903	46876	46876	Tom	351	“ Canada was assigned the east coast , the Mexicans the Gulf Coast . ”

46917	46934	46914	46914	Ben	369	“ Although in the world today the very idea of a neutral power is a joke . ”
46940	46980	46914	46914	Ben	369	“ Japanese own the offshore islands here , and Hawaii . It 's easiest for the rich Japanese to get to Hawaii , and then here , but we 're told tourists of all nationalities want to try it . "

47052	47101	47048	47049	the Mayor	5274	“ The Russians did it . So we 've been told . Of course it 's obvious . Who else was going to come up with two thousand neutron bombs ? Most countries could n't even afford the vans those things were hidden in when they went off . ”

PRINTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA GL 2744910 engl 3 - 785 INTRODUCTION by Terry Carr If you 're getting a little tired of reading science fiction novels that are just like the ones you read last month or last year , this book is for you . It 's published under the label “
47526	48123	47228	47228	Ben	369	” because it 's just that , something fresh and different and , we believe , a novel superior to most of those you 'll find today . I 'll tell you why I think so a little later ; first , though , I should say a little about the Ace Science Fiction Specials series . The SF Specials program is specifically designed to present new novels of high quality and imagination , books that are as exciting as any tale of adventures in the stars and as convincing as the most careful extrapolation of the day after tomorrow 's science . Add to that a rigorous insistence on literary qualitylucid and evocative writing , fully rounded characterization , and strong underlying themes ( but not Messages ) and you have a good description of the stories you 'll see in this series . The publishers of Ace Books believe that there are many readers today who are looking for such books , at a time when vi Terry Carr so many science fiction novels are simply skilled ( or not so skilled ) rehashings of plots and ideas that have been popular in the past . Science fiction by its very nature ought to tell stories that are new and unusual , but too many of the science fiction books published recently have been short on real imagination — they are , in fact , timid and literarily defensive . The Ace SF Specials are neither . The SF Specials began more than fifteen years ago , when the science fiction field was in a period of creative doldrums similar to the present : science fiction novels then were mostly of the traditional sort , often hackneyed and familiar stories that relied on fast action and obvious ideas . Ace began the first series of SF Specials with the idea that science fiction readers would welcome something more than that , novels that would expand the boundaries of imagination , and that notion proved to be correct : the books published in that original series sold well , collected numerous awards , and many of them are now considered classics in the field . Beginning in 1968 and continuing into 1971 , the Ace SF Specials included such novels as Past Master by R. A. Lafferty , Rite of Passage by Alexei Panshin , Synthajoy by D. G. Compton , The Left Hand of Darkness by Ursula K. Le Guin , Picnic on Paradise and And Chaos Died by Joanna Russ , Pavane by Keith Roberts , The Isle of the Dead by Roger Zelazny , The Warlord of the Air by Michael Moorcock , The Year of the Quiet Sun by Wilson Tucker , Mechasm by John Sladek , The Two - Timers by Bob Shaw , and The Phoenix and the Mirror by Avram Davidson ... among many others that could be mentioned , but the list is already long . Most of those books were nominated for awards . Rite of Passage won the Nebula Award ; The Left Hand of Darkness won both the Nebula and the Hugo ; The Year of the Quiet Sun won the John W. Campbell Award . Other books in the series won more specialized awards . Most of the novels have remained in print over the years since they were first published . That original series ended when I left Ace Books and moved to California in 1971 , but its successes had n't gone unnoticed . Both writers and publishers saw that a more “
48125	49113	47228	47228	Ben	369	” sort of science fiction could attract a large readership , and during the seventies more venturesome sf novels were published than ever before . A number of critics have credited the Ace Science Fiction INTRODUCTION vii Specials with bringing about a revolution in sf publishing , and I like to think this is at least partly true . But nothing would have changed if there had n't been editors and publishers who wanted to upgrade the product ; and in particular , it required science fiction writers who could produce superior novels . Fortunately , such writers were there ; some of them had contributed to the SF Specials series , some had been writing quality sf novels already ( Samuel R. Delany , Philip K. Dick , and Robert Silverberg are examples ) , and many writers of talent entered the science fiction field during this period who did n't feel constrained by the thud - and - blunder traditions of earlier sf . So in the early seventies science fiction was an exciting field : quality sf novels appeared from many publishers , they sold very well , and science fiction moved toward the front of literary achievement . It was reviewed in The New York Times and analyzed by academic critics ; major universities offered courses studying science fiction . It seemed that science fiction had finally become respectable . But other trends began to be felt , and although they brought many new readers to science fiction , for the most part they caused sf to look back instead of forward . The television series Star Trek attracted an enormous following , as did the Star Wars movies , Alien , Close Encounters of the Third Kind , E.T. , and others ; these products of the visual media introduced millions of people to science fiction , but though many were enthusiastic enough to buy sf books too , what they wanted were stories as simple and familiar as the films they had enjoyed . When they found science fiction books that were like the television and movie productions , they bought them in great numbers ; when the books were more complex or unusual , sales were much lower . So in recent years sf publishers have catered to this vast new market . The result has been that most of the science fiction published today is no more advanced and imaginative than the sf stories of the fifties , or even the forties : basic ideas and plots are reworked time and again , and when a novel proves to be popular , a sequel or a series will come along soon . There 's nothing wrong with such books ; when they 're well written they can be very good . But when authors are constrained to writing nothing but variations on the plots and styles of the past , much of the excitement of science fiction disappears . Science fiction is a literature of change ; more than any other viii Terry Carr kind of writing , sf needs to keep moving forward if it 's to be exciting . The novels in this new series of Ace SF Specials do look forward rather than back . They 're grounded in the traditions of science fiction but they all have something new to add in ideas or literary development . And they are all written by authors who are comparatively new to science fiction , because it 's usually the new writers who have the freshest ideas . ( Most of those novels in the original series that came to be called classics were written by authors who were then at the beginnings of their careers . ) Ace Books asked me to edit this new SF Specials series because they believe the time is right for such adventurous books . The new readers who swelled the science fiction market in the last several years are by now familiar with the basic ideas and plots , and many of them will want something more . This new SF Specials series offers stories that explore more imaginative territory . Kim Stanley Robinson 's The Wild Shore is a good example . It 's the first published novel of a new sf writer whose short stories and novelettes have been nominated for both the Hugo and Nebula awards . Its story of life in the United States as it might be after a nuclear strike that destroys our cities and reduces the nation to isolated enclaves of people living in the ruins and working their way back to civilization is familiar in its opening premises , but it adds a depth of characterization and background that has rarely been approached in science fiction before now . The Wild Shore is a novel of adventure , the story of a boy growing up rapidly in dangerous circumstances , and you 'll find yourself turning the pages to see what happens next ; this is the criterion for any good novel . But there 's much more in the book , and I 'll let you discover the rest for yourself . There will be more Ace Science Fiction Specials coming soon , and each will be as different from the usual science fiction fare as this one is . I hope you 'll watch for them .

49177	49267	49324	49326	cuffKim Stanley Robinson	259	” The five of us considered it . Near sunset the cliffs at the mouth of our valley glow amber , and on the wide beach below tangles of driftwood cast shadows all the way to the sandstone boulders at the foot of the cliff . Each clump of wave - worn wood could have been a gravemarker , swamped and washed on its side , and I imagined digging under one to find what lay beneath it . Gabby Mendez tossed a pebble out at a gliding seagull . “
49276	49282	49324	49326	cuffKim Stanley Robinson	259	” he demanded of Nicolin . “
49294	49310	49311	49311	We	1741	" Nicolin winked at me ; I was his partner in these sorts of things . “

49349	49507	49324	49326	cuffKim Stanley Robinson	259	” said Kristen Mariani . We were on the point of the cliff above the rivermouth Steve Nicolin and Gabby , Kristen and Mando Costa , Del Simpson and me — all old friends , grown up together , out on our point as we so often were at the end of a day , arguing and talking and making wild plans ... that last being the specialty of Nicolin and me . Below us in the first bend of the river were the fishing boats , pulled up onto the tidal flats . It felt good to sit on the warm sand in the cool wind with my friends , watching the sun leak into the whitecaps , knowing my work for the day was done . I felt a little drowsy . Gabby slung another pebble at the gulls , who ignored it and landed in a group near the boats , bitching over fishheads . "
49523	49528	49530	49530	queens	5277	” Nicolin went on . “
49532	49541	49530	49530	queens	5277	" he said to Kristen , who nodded . “
49573	49602	49605	49605	you	1747	” And not what your father tells you to , I thought to myself . But I felt the pull of what he said , I admit it . “
49626	49633	49605	49605	you	1747	" Gab asked , looking doubtful . “
49648	49652	49653	49653	Henry	284	” Nicolin scolded . “
49659	49660	49653	49653	Henry	284	” "
49673	49683	49661	49661	They	1749	" I said , like I was an authority . “
49712	49719	49720	49720	He	351	" Steve nodded at me approvingly . “
49731	49732	49733	49733	He	351	” “
49743	49747	49733	49733	He	351	” Gabby replied . "
49762	49814	49733	49733	He	351	” But I had almost convinced him ; he knew that Tom Barnard , who had taught us to read and write ( taught Steve and Mando and me , anyway ) , would describe the wealth of the old time , in detail , as quick as you might say , "
49818	49820	49733	49733	He	351	” . “
49832	49840	49822	49822	we	1751	” Nicolin went THE WILD SHORE on , “
49859	49860	49855	49855	we	1751	” “
49869	49873	49874	49874	Tom	351	” said Gabby . "
49883	49896	49874	49874	Tom	351	" Kristen reminded us . Nicolin tilted his head back and laughed . “
49906	49912	49900	49900	he	351	” He looked more serious . “
49946	49980	49938	49938	they	5289	” He had no way to be sure of that , as we had never been up there day or night ; but before Gabby could call him on it , Mando squeaked , “
49984	49986	49938	49938	they	5289	” . “
49989	49993	49994	49994	I	0	” Nicolin cried . “
50005	50009	49994	49994	I	0	” Kristen said . "
50025	50030	50011	50012	your pa	5291	" Nicolin asked Mando . “
50057	50063	50046	50047	This gang	5292	" He lowered his voice : “
50078	50088	50046	50047	This gang	5292	" laughing at the look on Mando 's face . “
50101	50109	50093	50093	you	1758	” I said , half to myself . “
50116	50120	50110	50110	I	0	” Del said . "
50128	50383	50122	50122	I	0	” Mando said quickly , to show he was n't scared . And suddenly we were talking a plan . I perked up and paid more attention , a bit surprised . Nicolin and I had outlined a number of schemes before : trapping a tiger in the back country , diving for sunken treasure on the concrete reef , extracting the silver contained in old railroad tracks by melting them . But most of these proposals had certain practical difficulties to them that became apparent at some time or other in the discussion , and we let them slide . They were just talk . With this particular plan , however , all we had to do was sneak up into the ruins — something we always swore we really wanted to do — and dig . So we talked about which night the scavengers were least likely to be out and about ( full moon , Nicolin assured Mando , when the ghosts were visible ) , who we might ask to come along , who it would have to be kept secret from , how we could chop the silver handles into tradeable discs , and so forth . Then the ocean was lapping at the red rim of the sun , and Kim Stanley Robinson it got a good deal colder . Gabby stood up and kneaded his butt , talking about the venison supper he was going to have that night . The rest of us got up too . “
50393	50398	50384	50384	We	1764	” Nicolin said intently . “
50409	51324	50403	50403	I	0	" As we walked up from the point I took myself off from the rest , and followed the cliff 's edge . Out on the wide beach the tidal puddles streaking the sand were a dark silver , banded with red little models of the vast ocean surging beyond them . On the other side of me was the valley , our valley , winding up into the hills that crowded the sea . The trees of the forest blanketing the hills all waved their branches in the sunset onshore wind , and their late spring greens were tinted pollen color by the drowning sun . For miles up and down the curving reach of the coast the forest tossed , fir and spruce and pine like the hair of a living creature , and as I walked I felt the wind toss my hair too . On the ravine - creased hillsides not one sign of man could be seen ( though they were there ) , it was nothing but trees , tall and short , redwood and torrey pine and eucalyptus , dark green hills cascading into the sea , and as I walked the amber cliff 's edge I was happy . I did n't have the slightest inkling of a notion that my friends and I were starting a summer that would ... change us . As I write this account of those months , deep in the harshest winter I have ever known , I have the advantage of time passed , and I can see that this excursion in search of silver was the start of it — not so much because of what happened , understand , but because of what did n't happen , because of the ways in which we were deceived . Because of what it gave us a taste for . I was hungry , you see ; not just for food ( that was a constant ) , but for a life that was more than fishing , and hoeing weeds , and checking snares . And Nicolin was hungrier than I. But I 'm getting ahead of my story . As I strolled the steep sandstone border between forest and sea , I had no premonition of what was to come , nor any heed for the warnings of the old man . I was just excited by the thought of an adventure . As I turned up the south path towards the little cabin that my pa and I shared , the smells of pine and sea salt raked the insides of my nose and made me drunk with hunger , and happily I imagined chips of silver the size of a dozen dimes . It occurred to me that my friends and I were for the very first time in our lives actually going to do what we had so often boastfully THE WILD SHORE planned to do — and at the thought I felt a thrilling shiver of anticipation , I leaped from root to root in the trail : we were invading the territory of the scavengers , venturing north into the ruins of Orange County . The night we picked to do it , fog was smoking up off the ocean and gusting onshore , under a quarter moon that gave all the white mist patches a faint glow . I waited just inside the door of our cabin , ignoring Pa 's snores . I had read him to sleep an hour before , and now he lay heavily on his side , calloused fingers resting on the crease in the side of his head . Pa is lame , and simple , on account of tangling with a horse when I was young . My ma always used to read him to sleep , and when she died Pa sent me up to Tom 's to carry on with my learning , saying in his slow way that it would be good for both of us . Right he was , I suppose . I warmed my hands now and then over the gray coals of the stove fire , as I had the cabin door partway open , and it was cold . Outside , the big eucalyptus down the path blew in and out of visibility . Once I thought I saw figures standing under it ; then a clammy puff of fog drifted onto the house , smelling like the rivermouth flats , and when it cleared away the tree stood alone . I wished the others would come . Except for Pa 's snoring there was no sound but the quiet patter of fog dew , sliding off leaves onto our roof . W - whooo , w - whooo . Nicolin 's call startled me from a doze . It was a pretty good imitation of the big canyon owls , although the owls only called out once a year or so , it seemed , so it did n't make much sense as a secret call in my opinion . It did beat a leopard 's cough , however , which had been Nicolin 's first choice , and which might have gotten him shot . I slipped out the door and hurried down the path to the eucalyptus . Nicolin had Del 's two shovels over his shoulders ; Del and Gabby stood behind him . “
51332	51344	51345	51345	Costa	281	" I said . Del and Gabby looked at each other . “
51347	51356	51345	51345	Costa	281	” Nicolin said . I stared at him . “
51364	51395	51357	51357	He	281	" Mando and I were younger than the other three - me by one year , Mando by three - and I sometimes felt obliged to stick up for him . “
51404	51486	51396	51396	His	281	” Nicolin told the others . We took the river path to the bridge , crossed and hiked up the hill path leading to the Costas ' . Kim Stanley Robinson Doc Costa 's weird oildrum house looked like a little black castle out of one of Tom 's books - squat as a toad , and darker than anything natural in the fog . Nicolin made his call , and pretty soon Mando came out and hustled down to us . "
51495	51505	51487	51487	You	1767	” he asked , peering around at the mist . “
51508	51527	51487	51487	You	1767	” I said quickly , before the others seized on his hesitation as an excuse to leave him . “
51533	51534	51535	51535	I	0	” “
51538	51798	51535	51535	I	0	" He went back inside and got it . When he returned we walked back down to the old freeway and headed north on it . We walked fast to warm up . The freeway was two pale ribbons in the mist , heavily cracked underfoot , black weeds in every crack . Quickly we crossed the ridge marking the north end of our valley , and narrow San Mateo Valley immediately to the north of the ridge . After that , we were walking up and down the steep hills of San Clemente . We held close together , and did n't say much . On each side of us ruins sat in the forest : walls of cement blocks , roofs held up by skeletal foundations , tangles of wire looping from tree to tree -- all of it dark and still . But we knew the scavengers lived up here somewhere , and we hurried along as silently as the ghosts Del and Gab had been joking about , a mile back where they 'd felt more comfy . A wet tongue of fog licked over us as the freeway dropped into a broad canyon , and we could n't see a thing but the broken surface of the road . Creaks emerged from the dark wet silence around us , as well as an occasional flurry of dripping , as if something had brushed against leaves , something following us , for instance . Nicolin stopped to examine an offramp curving down to the right . “
51803	51807	51853	51853	you	1771	” he hissed . “
51817	51818	51821	51821	you	1771	" “
51824	51837	51821	51821	you	1771	” Gab said in his ordinary voice , which sounded awfully loud . “
51846	51850	51838	51838	I	0	” Nicolin said . “
51858	52201	51853	51853	you	1771	” We followed him off the highway , pretty impressed that he had come up here alone . Even I had n't heard about that one . Down in the forest there were more buildings than trees , almost , and they were big buildings . They were falling down every way possible ; windows and doors knocked out like teeth , with shrubs and ferns growing in every hole ; walls slumped ; roofs THE WILD SHORE piled on the ground like barrows . The fog followed us up this street , rustling things so they sounded like thousands of scurrying feet . Wires looped over poles that sometimes tilted right down to the road ; we had to step over them , and none of us touched the wires . A coyote 's bark chopped the drippy silence and we all froze . Was that a coyote or a scavenger ? But nothing followed it , and we took off again , more nervous than ever . The street made some awkward switchbacks at the head of the valley , and once we got up those , we were on the canyon - cut plateau that once made up the top of San Clemente . Up here were houses , big ones , all set in rows by the street like fish out to dry , as if there had been so many people that there was n't room to give each family a decent garden . A lot of the houses were busted and overgrown , and some were gone entirely- just floors , with pipes sticking out of them like arms sticking up out of a grave . Scavengers had lived here , and had used the houses one by one for firewood , moving on when their nest was burned ; it was a practice I had heard about , but I 'd never before seen the results first hand , the destruction and waste . Nicolin stopped at a street crossing filled with a bonfire pit . "
52210	52214	52205	52205	their	1772	” Del observed . “
52220	52401	52205	52205	their	1772	” said Nicolin . We followed him north , along a street that paralleled the ocean on the plateau 's edge . Below us the fog was like another ocean , putting us on the beach again so to speak , with occasional white waves running up over us . The houses lining the street stopped , and a fence began , metal rails connecting stone piles . Beyond the fence the rippling plateau was studded with squared stones , sticking out of tall grass : the cemetery . We all stopped and looked . In the mist it was impossible to see where it ended ; it looked like an awful big cemetery . Finally we stepped over a break in the fence and walked into the thick grass , between bushes and tombstones . They had lined up the graves as straight as their houses . Suddenly Nicolin faced the sky and yowled his coyote yowl , yip yip yoo - ee - oo - ee - oo - eeee , yodeling as crazily as any bush dog . “
52405	52411	52205	52205	their	1772	” Gabby said , disgusted . “

52428	52436	52437	52437	Boys	5338	” Mando added fearfully . Nicolin laughed . “
52456	52474	52449	52451	Kim Stanley Robinson	287	” He crouched down to read a gravestone ; too dark ; he hopped over to another . “
52482	52500	52449	52451	Kim Stanley Robinson	287	” He put his face next to it and with the help of his fingers read it . “
52537	52539	52449	52451	Kim Stanley Robinson	287	” . “
52550	52554	52449	52451	Kim Stanley Robinson	287	” I said . “

52569	52573	52574	52577	Be - loved father	5342	” Nicolin said . “
52593	52605	52579	52579	I	0	” For a while no one answered . Then Gab said , “
52611	52612	52579	52579	I	0	" “
52615	52629	52579	52579	I	0	” Nicolin replied . He put down one shovel and hefted the other . “
52640	52677	52579	52579	I	0	" He started stabbing the shovel into the ground , making a line cut . Gabby and Del and Mando and I just stood and stared at him . He looked up and saw us watching . “
52680	52685	52579	52579	I	0	” he demanded quickly . “
52781	52794	52778	52778	Gabby	279	“ It 's getting dark down here ; better light the lantern . ”
52941	52947	52948	52948	he	279	“ They buried them deep , ”
52961	52970	52971	52971	Del	282	“ Maybe this one 's already dug up , ”
52997	53000	53001	53001	Nicolin	336	“ Sure , ”
53004	53018	53001	53001	Nicolin	336	“ Or maybe they buried him alive and he crawled out by himself . ”
53019	53024	53025	53025	Mando	281	“ My hand hurts , ”
53043	53049	53050	53050	Nicolin	336	“ My hand hurts ’ , ”
53053	53062	53050	53050	Nicolin	336	“ Well get out of there , then . ”
53215	53219	53220	53220	he	281	“ Got it , ”
53238	53247	53235	53235	he	281	" Move the lantern down to this end . "
53333	53343	53309	53309	him	281	“ The damn thing 's buried under the headstone ! "
53408	53440	53405	53405	Nicolin	336	" Henry , you 've done the least digging so far , and you 're long and skinny , so crawl down there and start pushing the dirt back to us . "
53528	53537	53518	53519	The others	5328	“ Well , we 're going home now , "
53539	53547	53521	53523	Kim Stanley Robinson	287	“ Oh , who 's that coming ? "
53549	53557	53521	53523	Kim Stanley Robinson	287	" Did you feel the coffin shake just then?”—but
53601	53611	53612	53612	Steve	285	“ Henry , I can always count on you , ”
53712	53718	53719	53719	Del	282	“ Look at those handles , ”
53766	53769	53771	53771	Mando	281	" Man , "
53773	53782	53771	53771	Mando	281	“ Will you look at all that silver . ”
53873	53876	53877	53877	he	279	“ Hey , ”
53880	53883	53877	53877	he	279	“ Uh ... ”
53953	53959	53960	53960	he	279	“ This ai n't silver , ”
53963	53982	53960	53960	he	279	“ It 's cut . It 's some kind of ... some kind of plastic , I guess . ”
53983	53987	53989	53989	Nicolin	285	“ God damn , ”
54033	54040	54041	54041	Nicolin	285	“ God damn that old liar , "
54050	54068	54069	54069	He	285	“ He told us that every single one of those funerals cost a fortune . He said — ”
54085	54094	54095	54095	He	285	“ He told us there 'd be silver . "
54117	54125	54126	54126	he	281	“ Should call this headstone a kneestone , ”
54143	54151	54137	54137	Nicolin	285	“ Should we go for his ring ? "
54152	54155	54156	54156	Mando	281	“ No ! ”
54166	54178	54179	54179	Nicolin	285	" Go for his ring and belt buckle and dental work ? ”
54237	54251	54230	54230	He	285	“ Let 's bury this guy and then go bury the old man . "
54306	54320	54321	54321	Gabby	279	“ Appears he 's been bucking around down there , do n't it , "
54415	54456	54410	54410	Nicolin	285	“ You know , since they had those plastic handles colored silver , it must mean that some time before that people were buried with real silver handles — richer people , or people buried before 1984 , or whatever . ”
54512	54520	54521	54521	Gabby	279	“ Some sort of God damned plastic , ”
54546	54567	54536	54536	he	279	" Whoo , hoo hoo hoo ... we just spent all night digging up five pounds of plastic . Plastic ! "
54695	54700	54701	54701	Mando	281	“ What is it ? ”
54704	54707	54708	54708	Nicolin	285	“ Scavengers ! ”

58673	58712	58573	58573	Tom	351	" I went down to look at him . Washed up just north of the rivermouth . A Japanese , I 'd venture . We buried him at the back of the graveyard with the rest of them . "

I have n't seen a foreigner - a live foreigner , that is — those dead ones make mighty poor informants , hee hee — since the day .

Then one day some giant drew a straight line down it all , and everything THE WILD SHORE west of the line fell down and the ocean came rushing in . Where the line crossed a hill there 's a cliff , and where it crossed a valley there 's a marsh and a beach . But always a straight line , see ? The hills do n't stick out into the ocean , and water does n't come and fill in the valleys . "

Very slowly - in your lifetime it might move an inch - in mine two , hee hee — and we 're next to a fault where the plates meet . The Pacific plate is sliding north , and the land here south . That 's why you get the straight line there . And earthquakesyou've felt them — those are the two plates slipping , grinding against each other . One time ... one time in the old time , there was an earthquake that shattered every city on this coast . Buildings fell like they did on the day . Fires burned and there was no water to put them out . Freeways like that one down there pointed at the sky , and no one could get in to help , at first . For a lot of people it was the end . But when the fires were burned out ... they came from everywhere . They brought in giant machines and material , and they used the rubble that was all that was left of the cities . A month later every one of those cities was built back up again , just as they had been before , so exactly that you could n't even tell there had been an earthquake . ”

We walked over to the north half of the park , where the scavengers stayed - keeping a clear route back home , perhaps . The camps and goods for trade were much different here : no food , except for several women guarding trays of spices and canned delicacies . We passed a man dressed in a shiny blue suit , trading tools that were spread out over a blanket on the grass . Some of the tools were rusty , others brighter than silver , each a different shape and size . We tried to guess what this or that tool had been for . One that gave us the giggles was two pairs of greenish metal clamps at each end of a wire in a tube of orange plastic . “

We walked on , past large displays of bright clothing and shiny shoes , and big rusty machines that were no use without electricity , and gun men with their crowd of spectators , on hand to watch the occasional big trade or demonstration shot . The seed exchange , on the border between the scavengers ' camps and ours , was hopping as usual . I wanted to go over and see if Kathryn was trading , because the way she traded for seeds was an art ; but in the crowd of traders I could n't see THE WILD SHORE 39 if she was there , and suddenly Melissa tugged on my arm . “

66102	66109	66020	66020	I	0	” said the tool trader . ( “
66113	66121	66020	66020	I	0	” the old man got in ) . “
66156	66157	66020	66020	I	0	" "
66170	66175	66020	66020	I	0	" Tom said scornfully . “
66306	66330	66289	66289	I	0	” The tool man dipped two fingers in the jar the old man held before him , and licked the honey off them . “
66337	66339	66289	66289	I	0	” . “
66378	66397	66400	66400	you	2154	" Tom cracked his palm against the side of his head to loosen the hinges of his memory . “
66407	66408	66400	66400	you	2154	" “
66416	66417	66413	66413	you	2154	" “

66495	66502	66490	66490	they	2160	" handing the jars to him . “
66520	66521	66517	66517	I	0	" "
66533	66541	66522	66522	I	0	” the scavenger said with a laugh . “
66548	66569	66522	66522	I	0	” He took the lighter , clear plastic with a metal cap , and gave it to the old man . “
66576	66598	66522	66522	I	0	" Tom said , pocketing the lighter eagerly and pulling me away with him . Under the next tree he stopped . “
66635	66669	66627	66627	you	284	” He pulled out the lighter and held it before my face , pulled his thumb down the side . He let the flame stand for a second , then shut it off . “
66674	66678	66627	66627	you	284	” I said . “
66687	66697	66703	66703	you	284	" He put his wrinkled face close to mine . “
66738	66750	66627	66627	you	284	” He reached over his shoulder and rooted in his pack . “
66757	66768	66627	66627	you	284	” He offered me a small bottle of amber liquid . “
66778	66787	66769	66769	You	2154	” He grinned his gap - toothed grin . “
66813	66821	66827	66829	that first one	2165	” I took a swallow , gasped . "
66841	66845	66827	66829	that first one	2165	” I did . “
66849	66874	66827	66829	that first one	2165	” I traded swallows with him and pointed out Melissa , who looked like she was n't making much headway with the barrel woman . “
66877	66884	66827	66829	that first one	2165	” said Tom , leering significantly . “
66895	66899	66887	66887	she	2166	” I agreed . “
66921	66922	66912	66912	I	0	” “

66952	66956	66939	66939	you	2154	” he protested . “
66970	66974	66939	66939	you	2154	” THE WILD SHORE “
66995	67021	67022	67022	We	2171	” I got back to Melissa with my stomach burning and my head spinning . Melissa was saying slowly , like for the fourth time , “
67091	67092	67093	67093	I	0	" “
67098	67103	67093	67093	I	0	” the woman snapped . “
67154	67155	67142	67142	I	0	” "
67174	67182	67163	67163	you	0	" I interrupted in a friendly way . "
67258	67293	67235	67235	we	2171	” Melissa had been glaring at me for butting in on her deal , but now she smiled hopefully at the woman . The woman stared at the honey jar , but looked unconvinced . “
67305	67309	67235	67235	we	2171	” I said . "
67344	67345	67327	67327	you	0	" “
67356	67361	67346	67346	Everyone	938	” the woman said . "

67383	67385	67379	67379	you	2181	” . "
67412	67417	67398	67398	they	938	" The woman hesitated . “
67428	67429	67430	67430	You	0	” "
67433	67453	67430	67430	You	0	” I said , hoping there was n't a copy nearby , for crabs are only a dollar fifty .. “
67456	67461	67462	67462	I	0	" said the woman , “
67471	67487	67462	67462	I	0	" Rolling the barrel half back to our camp , Melissa forgot about my rudeness . “
67491	67495	67489	67489	Henry	284	” she sang , “
67502	67507	67498	67498	I	0	” 42 Kim Stanley Robinson “
67510	67514	67498	67498	I	0	” I said , "
67521	67590	67591	67591	You	284	” I stopped the barrel to let pass a crowd of shepherds with a giant table upside - down on their heads . Melissa wrapped her arms around me and gave me a good kiss . We stood there looking at each other before starting up again ; her cheeks were flushed , her body warm against mine . As we started walking again she smacked her lips . “
67597	67598	67599	67599	Ah	2184	” “
67611	67612	67602	67602	Barnard	351	" “
67616	67623	67602	67602	Barnard	351	” She looked over her shoulder . "
67632	67826	67630	67630	myself	0	” Back at camp Melissa went off to meet Kristen and I helped the end of the fish trading . Nicolin came by with a cigarette and under the sunbeams sparking the dust in the afternoon air we smoked it . Soon after that a fight started between a Pendleton cowboy and a scavenger , and it was broken up by a crowd of big angry men whose job was keeping things peaceful . These meet sheriffs did n't like their authority ignored , and people fighting were always going to lose , slapped around hard by this gang . After that I nodded off for an hour or two , back with the sleeping dogs . Rafael woke me when he came back to feed scraps to the perros . Only the western sky was still blue ; high clouds overhead still glowed with a bit of sunset light . I stood up too fast . When the blood got back to my head I walked over to our fire , where a few people were still eating . I crouched beside Kathryn and ate some of the stew she offered me . “
67831	67832	67829	67829	Steve	285	" “
67858	67859	67841	67841	He	285	" “
67862	67870	67841	67841	He	285	” I said , wolfing down stew . “
67879	67880	67873	67873	you	2187	" “
67962	67963	67952	67952	he	285	" "
67966	67970	67952	67952	he	285	" She shrugged . “
67983	67985	67971	67971	I	0	” : “
67995	67996	67971	67971	I	0	” “

68098	68099	68093	68093	They	2193	" “
68102	68108	68093	68093	They	2193	" I finished the stew . “
68118	68119	68116	68116	Steve	285	" “
68129	68133	68116	68116	Steve	285	” She laughed . “
68148	68276	68144	68144	you	297	" Among the new town camps on the south side of the park it was dark and quiet , except for the eerie , piercing cries of the Trabuco peacocks , protesting their cages . Small fires here and there made the trees above them flicker and dance with reflected light , and voices floated from the dark shapes blocking off the tiny flames . I stumbled over a root . In the northern half of the park it was different . Bonfires roared in three clearings , making the colored awnings flap in the branches . Lanterns casting a mean white glare hung from the trees . I stepped onto the promenade and was shoved in the back by a large woman in an orange dress . “
68281	68440	68279	68279	boy	5376	" I walked over to the Mission Viejo camp . A jar flew past me , spilling liquid and smashing against a tree . The bright plastic colors of scavenged clothing wavered in the firelight , and every scavenger , man , woman and child , had gotten out their full collection of jewelry ; they wore gold and silver necklaces , earrings , nose rings , ankle , belly , and wrist bracelets , and all of it studded with gems winking red and blue and green . They were beautiful . The Viejo camp had tables set end to end in long rows . The benches lining them were jammed with people drinking and talking and listening to the jazz band at one end of the camp . I stood and looked for a while , not seeing anyone I knew . Then Nicolin deliberately struck me in the arm , and with a grin said , “
68462	68599	68454	68454	Doc	287	” Tom was set up at the end table with a few other survivors from the old time : Doc Costa , Leonard Sarowitz from Hemet , and George something from Cristianitos . The four of them were a familiar sight at swap meets , and were often joined by Odd Roger and other survivors old enough to remember what the old time was like . Tom was the senior member of this group by a long shot . He saw us and made a spot on the bench beside him . We had a drink from Leonard 's jar ; I gagged and sent half my swallow down my shirt . This put the four ancients in hysterics . Kim Stanley Robinson Old Leonard 's gums were as clear of teeth as a babe 's . “
68604	68620	68621	68621	He	2197	" Doc asked George , getting back to their conversation . George shook his head . “
68625	68626	68621	68621	He	2197	” “
68632	68633	68621	68621	He	2197	” “
68642	68659	68634	68634	You	2198	” Tom said , slapping me on the shoulder . Leonard shook his head , frowning . “
68694	68706	68676	68676	I	0	” The others laughed , but Leonard shook his head again . “
68720	68721	68713	68713	You	2198	" “
68727	68728	68724	68724	you	2198	” “
68772	68773	68814	68814	I	0	" “
68779	68783	68814	68814	I	0	” Tom asked . “
68795	68796	68784	68784	I	0	" “
68802	68808	68784	68784	I	0	” Doc put in sourly . “
68817	68831	68814	68814	I	0	” Steve observed , rolling his eyes and going for the jar . . “
68851	68857	68834	68834	I	0	" Leonard went on . . "
68863	68867	68834	68834	I	0	" Tom said . “
68911	68926	68898	68898	we	2202	” . Doc was so outraged he cut Leonard off and answered for him : “
68933	68937	68898	68898	we	2202	” he said . “
69006	69007	68996	68997	Tom Barnard	351	” “
69010	69025	68996	68997	Tom Barnard	351	" Steve growled , and took another drink . I took the next one . “
69037	69041	68996	68997	Tom Barnard	351	” Tom said . “
69100	69101	69093	69098	the Chinese that planted the bombs	2216	” “
69107	69115	69102	69102	You	2217	” Doc said . THE WILD SHORE 45 “

69147	69151	69144	69145	The French	319	” George cried . “

69164	69168	69161	69162	the Vietnamese	320	" Leonard said . “
69174	69178	69161	69162	the Vietnamese	320	” Tom replied . “
69270	69274	69267	69267	he	317	” Doc said , “
69287	69288	69289	69289	He	317	" "
69296	69300	69289	69289	He	317	” said Tom . "
69355	69356	69357	69357	Ants	321	" "
69363	69386	69357	69357	Ants	321	” George said . Steve and I bent our heads to the table , giggling and pushing our fingers in each others ' sides—“pushing
69390	69427	69357	69357	Ants	321	” as the old men said . Odd that pushing a button could start a war .... Tom was giving us a mean look , so we straightened up and drank some more to calm ourselves . "
69436	69448	69357	69357	Ants	321	" Doc was saying . Every meet the number went up . “
69473	69511	69469	69469	I	0	” The bantering tone was gone from his voice ; even though they had this argument every time they joined the other antiques , almost , Doc was still getting angry at Tom . Bitterly he cried , “
69548	69549	69537	69537	They	5562	" “
69556	69578	69554	69554	Ernest	322	" Tom said jovially , trying to put the fun back in their argument . He waved at the surrounding scene . “
69582	69586	69587	69587	I	0	” Doc said . “
69596	69597	69598	69598	I	0	” “
69604	69608	69598	69598	I	0	” said Tom . “
69617	69628	69609	69609	They	5562	" Leonard , however , was only listening to Doc : “
69658	69659	69655	69655	We	2202	” “
69662	69666	69655	69655	We	2202	” said George . “
69672	69693	69695	69696	a doctor	5565	” Barnard just shook his head and grabbed the jar from Steve , who gave him a struggle for it . “
69708	69709	69706	69706	Ernest	322	” “
69729	69734	69724	69724	they	2236	” Doc replied fiercely . “
69742	69743	69724	69724	they	2236	” “
69751	69757	69758	69758	They	2236	” Steve said to me . “
69774	69775	69771	69772	the Chinese	299	" “
69780	69807	69777	69778	the French	319	” I said , and we slithered off the bench . I took a last gulp of the old man 's liquor and he whacked me . “
69816	69820	69812	69812	you	2237	” he cried . “
69831	69832	69833	69833	We	2202	” “
69839	69843	69833	69833	We	2202	” Steve said . “

69896	69900	69901	69901	You	2242	" Leonard said . “
69912	70046	69903	69903	you	2242	" We wandered off to the sound of this sort of thing , and made our way with some stumbling to the orange tree . This was a giant old oak , one of a half dozen or so in the park , that held in its branches gas lanterns wrapped in transparent orange plastic . It was the mark of the scavengers from central Orange County , and our gang used it as the meeting place for later at night . We did n't see anyone from Onofre , so we sat on the grass under the tree , arms around each other , and made ribald comments on the passing crowd . Steve waved down a man selling jars of liquor and gave him two dimes for a jar of tequila . “
70062	70114	70054	70054	we	2243	" the man intoned as he moved on . On the other side of the orange tree a small bike - powered generator was humming and crackling ; a group of scavengers was using it to operate a small instant oven , cooking slabs of meat or whole potatoes in seconds . “
70121	70125	70054	70054	we	2243	” they cried . "
70141	70166	70167	70167	I	0	” I took a sip of the tequila ; it was strong stuff , but I was drunk enough to want to get drunker . “
70171	70176	70167	70167	I	0	” I told Steve . “
70187	70192	70181	70181	I	0	” THE WILD SHORE 47 “
70197	70201	70194	70194	you	2242	” Steve said . “
70207	70220	70194	70194	you	2242	" He pointed at one of the scavenger women 's heavy necklaces . “
70225	70232	70233	70233	Hanker	297	” He took a long swallow . “
70385	70386	70370	70370	Hanker	297	” “
70394	70484	70370	70370	Hanker	297	” I remarked solemnly as I gave him the jar . Neither of us needed any more liquor , but when Gabby and Rebel and Kathryn and Kristen showed up , we were quick to help drink another jar . Steve forgot about silver for a while in favor of a kiss ; Kathryn 's red hair covered the sight . The band started again , a trumpet , a clarinet , two saxes , a drum and a bass fiddle , and we sang along with the tunes : “
70488	70490	70486	70486	Matilda	323	” or “
70494	70496	70492	70492	Susannah	324	” or “
70504	70637	70497	70497	I	0	" Melissa showed up and sat down beside me . She 'd been drinking and smoking , I could see . I put an arm around her , and over her shoulder Kathryn winked at me . More and more people crowded around the orange tree as the band heated up , and soon we could n't see anything but legs . We played a game of guessing what town people were from by their legs alone , and then we danced around the tree with the rest of the crowd . Much later we started our return to camp . I felt great . We pushed our way through singing people , gave our jars to the liquor man , and staggered onto the promenade , holding each other up and singing “
70640	70675	70676	70676	Chinga	365	” all out of tune with the fading sound of the band . Halfway home we collided with a group coming out of the trees , and I was roughly shoved to the ground . “
70678	70707	70676	70676	Chinga	365	” I said , and scrambled up . There were shouts and scufflings , a few others hit the ground and rolled back up swinging and shouting angrily . "
70711	70745	70765	70765	his	285	” The two groups separated and stood facing each other belligerently ; by the light of a distant lantern we saw that it was the gang from San Clemente , decked Kim Stanley Robinson "
70757	70760	70762	70762	Nicolin	285	“ Oh , ”
70773	70778	70765	70765	his	285	“ it 's them . "
70844	70850	70851	70851	Nicolin	285	“ Hello , Doll Grin , ”
70854	70865	70867	70868	the scavenger	1068	“ Little people should n't come into Clemente at night , "
70870	70875	70876	70876	Nicolin	285	“ What 's Clemente ? ”
70880	70892	70876	70876	Nicolin	285	“ Nothing north of us but ruins , ruins on ruins . "
70893	70906	70907	70908	Doll Grin	325	“ Little people might get scared . They might hear a sound , ”
70925	70930	70913	70916	the guys behind him	1125	" uhnnnnnn - eeeeeehhhhhhh , "
70955	70977	70951	70952	their leader	1127	“ We do n't like people like you in our town . Next time you wo n't get away so easy .... "
70984	70994	70995	70995	he	285	“ Found any good dead bodies to eat lately ? ”
71057	71066	71053	71053	he	285	“ Vultures ! Buzzards ! Wreckrats ! Zopilotes ! "
71099	71109	71094	71094	sheriffs	5585	“ What 's this ? Stop this — HEY ! "
71132	71142	71143	71146	one of the sheriffs	5587	“ You kids get the fuck out of here , "
71170	71208	71209	71209	We	2258	“ We 'll ban you all from swap meets forever if we have to break up these fights again . Now get out of here before we cave your faces in to make you think about it . ”
71250	71255	71241	71243	the Clemente gang	5592	" uhnnnnnneeeeeeee - uhnnnnnneeeeeeeeeeeeuhnnnnnnnnnnneeeeeeee ... "

72108	72123	72100	72100	he	5280	“ I 've just been talking with two men who were looking for me . ”
72124	72137	72138	72138	He	5280	" I saw you out there with them . Who were they ? ”
72151	72213	72138	72138	He	5280	“ Hank , those men were from San Diego . And they came here — or up to just south of Onofre , actually — they talked to Recovery Simpson and followed us to the meet , to talk with me , ai n't that nice - word gets around , you know , who a village elder is . Anyway ... ”
72214	72218	72143	72143	his	5280	“ The men . ”
72219	72235	72236	72236	We	2289	“ Yes ! These men say they got from San Diego to Onofre by train . "
72261	72267	72143	72143	his	5280	“ They came by train . ”

72406	72412	72403	72403	Pa	286	“ No doubt about it . ”
72481	72484	72485	72485	Pa	286	“ Whoo ! "
72988	73002	72978	72978	I	0	“ Now why ca n't he just wear a hat like everyone else ? ”

73021	73032	73010	73010	Mando	281	“ He does n't want to be like everyone else . ”

74436	74457	74460	74461	the women	5695	“ Hello in there , I say ! Greetings to you ! We 're travelers from the south ! Americans ! ”
74532	74538	74541	74541	him	278	“ What brings you here ? ”
74653	74667	74646	74648	The shorter man	5706	" Hello , Barnard . We met at the swap meet , remember ? ”
74670	74673	74668	74668	Tom	351	“ Yes . ”
74757	74778	74748	74750	The shorter man	5706	“ Thanks for taking us in . We 're from San Diego , as Mr. Barnard here will tell you . "
74784	74792	74793	74793	Tom	351	" Did you get here by train ? "
74805	74816	74817	74817	he	5713	“ We brought the cars within five miles of here , ”
74820	74855	74817	74817	he	5713	“ We left our crew • there and walked the rest of the way . We did n't want to work on the tracks closer to you until we talked with you about it . "
74856	74865	74866	74868	the shorter one	5714	“ We thought we 'd get here sooner , "
74871	74878	74866	74868	the shorter one	5714	“ but the storm slowed us . "
74879	74892	74893	74894	John Nicolin	278	" Why 'd you hike in a storm in the first place ? ”
74905	74923	74900	74902	the short one	5715	“ We prefer to hike under cloud cover . Ca n't be seen from above , then . ”
74935	74946	74947	74947	Tom	351	“ If you want to jump in that hot water , "
74950	74955	74947	74947	Tom	351	“ go right ahead . ”
74964	74970	74959	74961	the taller one	5716	“ Thank you , but ... "
74977	74981	74982	74984	the short one	5715	“ Looks warm , ”
74987	74990	74991	74992	the other	5705	“ True , ”
75017	75049	75005	75005	He	5705	" Perhaps we 'll just warm up by your fire , if that 's all right . It 's been a wet walk , and I 'd like to get dry . ”
75050	75065	75066	75066	John	278	“ Sure , sure . Do what you like ; the place is yours . ”
75103	75123	75099	75099	Steve	285	“ Did you hear that ? A train to San Diego ? We can get a ride down there ! "
75124	75130	75131	75131	I	0	" I guess we might , "
75195	75212	75213	75213	he	249	“ We 've been working on the rails north of Oceanside for a few weeks now , "
75233	75264	75229	75229	Jennings	249	“ The Mayor of San Diego has organized a bunch of work forces of various sorts , and our job is to establish better travel routes to the surrounding towns . ”
75265	75279	75280	75280	Tom	351	" Is it true that San Diego has a population of two thousand ? "
75283	75292	75229	75229	Jennings	249	“ I heard that at a swap meet . "
75293	75297	75298	75298	Jennings	249	" About that . ”
75301	75417	75298	75298	Jennings	249	“ And since the Mayor began organizing things , we 've accomplished a good deal . The settlements are pretty well scattered , but we have a train system between them that works well . All handcars , you understand , although we do have generators providing a good supply of electricity back home . There 's a weekly swap meet , and a fishing fleet , and a militia — all manner of things there were n't before . Naturally Lee and I are proudest of the exploration team . Why , we cleared highway eight all the way across the mountains to the Salton Sea , and shifted the train tracks onto it . ”
75436	75445	75446	75446	Tom	351	" The Salton Sea must be huge now , "
75457	75487	75454	75454	Lee	341	“ It 's fresh water now , too , and filled with fish . People out there were doing pretty good , considering how few of them there were . "
75488	75495	75496	75497	John Nicolin	278	“ What brings you up here ? ”
75538	75550	75551	75551	he	249	“ Well , we had the rails going up to Oceanside , ”
75554	75571	75551	75551	he	249	“ and the ruined tracks extended north of that , so we decided to repair them . "
75572	75575	75576	75576	John	278	“ Why ? ”
75595	75617	75619	75619	he	249	“ Why ? I guess you 'd have to ask the Mayor that one . It was his idea . You see "
75630	75645	75619	75619	he	249	further—"you're all aware that the Japanese are guarding us on the west coast here ? ”
75646	75650	75651	75651	John	278	“ Of course , ”
75654	75661	75662	75662	Rafael	292	“ You could hardly miss that , ”
75682	75694	75695	75695	Jennings	249	“ But I do n't mean from just the ships offshore , ”
75698	75708	75695	75695	Jennings	249	“ I mean from the sky . From satellites . ”
75709	75714	75715	75715	Tom	351	“ You mean cameras ? "
75718	75728	75715	75715	Tom	351	" Sure . You 've all seen the satellites ? ”
75774	75789	75791	75791	Jennings	249	“ Those satellites carry cameras that can see things no bigger than a rat , ”
75793	75802	75791	75791	Jennings	249	“ They really got the eye on us . "
75822	75830	75816	75816	they	2408	” Lee added with a humorless laugh . “
75835	75839	75816	75816	they	2408	” Jennings said . “
75872	75904	75905	75905	I	0	” People were shaking their heads in disbelief , but Tom and Rafael looked as if they believed it , and as people noticed this there were some angry comments made . “
75909	76052	75905	75905	I	0	" Doc said to Tom . Nat and Gabby and a couple others stared at the roof in dismay . To think we were being watched that closely ... it was terrible , somehow . Strangers are good for news , they say , but these two were really something . I wondered if this was something Tom had known about all along , and had never bothered to tell us , or if he had been ignorant of it too . From his look I guessed he might have known . I was n't sure that such surveillance made any difference in a practical way , but it sure felt awful , like a permanent trespass . At the same time it was fascinating . John looked to Tom for confirmation , and after a slight nod from him John said , “
76075	76076	76068	76068	your	2410	” “
76085	76090	76068	76068	your	2410	” Jennings said vaguely . “
76135	76140	76148	76148	you	2414	east"-he swelled indignantly at the memory—“we
76163	76164	76158	76158	They	2413	” “
76167	76181	76158	76158	They	2413	” Tom cried . At the words blew them up he had jerked . “
76192	76202	76182	76182	They	2413	” Jennings said . Lee snorted to hear this . "
76228	76229	76182	76182	They	2413	” “
76233	76240	76182	76182	They	2413	" Tom asked . Lee nodded . “
76264	76265	76266	76266	We	2411	" "
76275	76279	76266	76266	We	2411	” Jennings cackled . “
76285	76293	76266	76266	We	2411	” But no one laughed with him . “
76375	76376	76372	76372	he	5274	” “
76382	76389	76377	76377	We	2411	” Lee said with sudden enthusiasm . “
76477	76478	76513	76513	they	2413	" “
76487	76491	76513	76513	they	2413	” Jennings added . “
76510	76511	76513	76513	they	2413	" "
76527	76531	76520	76520	they	2413	" Lee said . “
76575	76625	76568	76568	we	2411	” The fact that these two men were struggling with the Japanese , even indirectly , silenced everyone in the room . They had a lot of eyes on them , and Jennings basked in it . Lee did n't notice . After a bit John pursued his question : “
76645	76667	76639	76640	your mayor	5756	” 60 Kim Stanley Robinson Lee was eyeing John sharper and sharper , but Jennings replied in a perfectly friendly way : "
76761	76762	76746	76747	The Mayor	5274	" “
76774	76778	76746	76747	The Mayor	5274	” Rafael said . “
76786	76791	76784	76784	officials	1190	” John said belligerently . “
76803	76809	76792	76792	Someone	5387	” Jennings said mildly . . “
76821	76825	76810	76811	The Mayor	5274	” said Lee . “
76839	76844	76845	76845	We	2411	” No one answered . “
76859	76879	76853	76853	they	1194	” Steve had been nudging me so often that my ribs were sore ; now he almost busted them . “
76885	76893	76881	76881	you	2422	” he said in a fierce whisper . “
76913	77010	76910	76910	their	1194	" Kathryn and I shushed him so we could hear the rest of the discussion . Then there was an absence : the roof was silent . The rain had let up , at least for the moment . Those who wanted to go home dry inquired , and found that Lee and Jennings planned to stay for a day or two . So several people gathered their ponchos and boots and left . Tom invited the San Diegans to stay up at his place , and they quickly accepted . Pa came over to me . "
77024	77038	76910	76910	their	1194	” . It looked like the talking was over , so I said , “
77044	77190	76910	76910	their	1194	" There was a sense of slowness and confusion to our departures . The strangers had told us so much we had never learned even at the swap meets that it filled our minds , and even finding the dry clothes that many kept at the bathhouse became difficult . I looked around ; after all the projects Lee and Jennings had listed the bathhouse did n't seem like much anymore . Pa and I got back into our wet clothes , as we had none to spare for the bathhouse , and we hurried home along the hissing brown river . By the time we got home it was drizzling again . We got the fire going good and sat in our beds as we ate our dried fish THE WILD SHORE 61 and tortillas , gabbing about the San Diegans and their train . “
77202	77206	77192	77192	they	2439	” I said . "
77232	77247	77220	77220	they	2439	" Bent tracks sticking off the cliff over the river marked where that was . “
77264	77265	77261	77261	Tom	351	" “
77272	77277	77261	77261	Tom	351	" Pa said admiringly . “
77296	77297	77289	77289	You	2444	" "
77302	77546	77547	77547	Henry	284	" I fell asleep thinking of trains , and of bridges made of nothing but train tracks . The next morning I was fishing drowned greens out of our garden when I caught sight of Kathryn walking down the path , muddy once again , holding a bunch of scraggly young corn stalks in her hand . She 'd been rolling up the tarps , and if they were up already , then she and her farm crew must have been at it since before first light , because they could never get as many people to help roll the tarps up as they could to put them down . Getting them back up was more or less their problem . And so of course Kathryn had just had a look at the damages . I could tell she was mad by the way she walked . The Mendezes ' dog ran out barking playfully at her and she swung a foot at it with a curse . The dog slipped avoiding her boot and yelped , then ran back to its garden . Kathryn stood in the path cursing , and then kicked the base of the big eucalyptus with her heavy boot , thump thump thump thump . I decided to pass on saying good morning to her . I could talk to her some other time . She walked on , cursing still . Tom appeared from the other direction . "
77549	77574	77575	77575	Henry	284	” he called . I waved to him as he approached . He stood looking down at me with a twinkle in his eye . "
77588	77589	77579	77579	you	284	” “
77592	77596	77579	77579	you	284	" I cried . “
77604	77620	77621	77621	I	0	” . · He laughed and sat down on the barrel half in our yard . “
77677	77679	77670	77670	I	0	" . "
77684	77690	77670	77670	I	0	" I stalked around him . “
77695	77696	77697	77697	I	0	" “
77713	77714	77710	77711	your pa	5291	" "
77718	77747	77710	77711	your pa	5291	” Pa said , looking around the corner of the house . 62 Kim Stanley Robinson He grinned , came around the comer carrying two buckets of water . “
77754	77755	77710	77711	your pa	5291	” “
77760	77764	77758	77758	Sky	346	" Tom said , “
77776	77855	77765	77765	I	0	” Pa put down the buckets and pulled his moustache while Tom told him about it . They wrangled over the value of a week of my work , both agreeing it was n't much , but differing over just how little it was , until they 'd worked out an agreement whereby Tom rented my services for whatever it took him to get a sewing machine that Pa had seen at the swap meet two months ago . “
77868	77872	77866	77866	Sky	346	” said Tom . “
77875	77879	77866	77866	Sky	346	” Pa said . “
77891	77907	77882	77882	Rafe	292	" And Tom was to deal with John Nicolin concerning my absence from the fishing . “
77910	77914	77882	77882	Rafe	292	” I said . “
77924	77937	77915	77915	You	2452	" Tom looked at me . Fingering his beard , he said , “
77947	77948	77942	77942	I	0	” "
77951	77954	77942	77942	I	0	” said Pa. “
78037	78087	78088	78088	Tom	351	” I agreed , and soon I was off running to the cliffs , singing San Diego , Sandy Dandy - ay - go . On the beach I shut up , and spent the afternoon fishing as usual . When we were back ashore I said to John , “
78118	78119	78102	78102	He	351	” “
78128	78136	78138	78138	him	351	” John said in his abrupt way . “
78144	78148	78138	78138	him	351	” he added . “
78160	78161	78156	78156	You	0	" “
78167	78316	78165	78165	sir	1218	” I said . With a mysterious wink at Steve I was off up the cliff . I ran the river path home , splashing every puddle . To San Diego ! To San Diego by train ! with . Thank you Chapter Five Late that afternoon the old man and I walked down the river path to the Nicolins ' . The valley cupped us like a green bowl , tilted to spill us into the sea . The air smelled of wet earth and wet trees . Overhead crows cawed and dipped and lazily flapped their ways home . Above them there was n't a cloud in the sky ; nothing but that pure dome of early evening blue . Naturally we were in high spirits . We skipped over puddles , cracked jokes , and described to each other the dinner we were headed for . “
78321	78327	78317	78317	I	0	” the old man declared . “
78330	78350	78351	78351	I	0	” He waved at Marvin Hamish and Nat Eggloff , who were fishing over a pool across the river . “
78365	78366	78358	78358	you	0	” “
78376	78377	78358	78358	you	0	" “
78387	78567	78381	78381	I	0	” We turned off the river path and climbed the trail leading to the Nicolins ' house . Once over the freeway we could see it through the trees . It was the biggest house in the valley , set on a fine patch 63 64 Kim Stanley Robinson of cleared land just behind the highest part of the beach cliff . The yard around the house had been planted with canyon grass , and the two - story , tile - roofed building stood on its green lawn ( well apart from the storage shed and the doghouses and the chicken coop ) like something left over from the old time . There were shutters bracketing glass windows , big eaves over the doors , and a brick chimney . Smoke lofted from this chiminey into the river - blue sky , and lamps glowed in the windows . Tom and I gave each other a look , and went to pump the door knocker . Before we got there Mrs. Nicolin threw the door open , crying , “
78589	78590	78575	78575	you	2459	" "
78595	78599	78593	78593	Christy	350	" Tom said . “
78615	78616	78740	78740	they	2461	" "
78621	78734	78740	78740	they	2461	" Mrs. Nicolin said , pulling back a loose strand of her thick black hair . But Tom was telling the truth ; Christy Nicolin had a beautiful face , strong and kind , and she was tall and rangy , even after bearing seven kids . Steve took a lot of his features from her rather than from John : his height , his sharp - edged nose and jaw , his mouth . Now she waved us in the door past her , shaking her head at the ceiling to show us , as she always did , that her day had been too harried to be described or imagined . “
78759	78896	78743	78743	They	2461	" Their house had a dozen or more rooms , but only the dining room had a giant set of windows facing west , so despite Mrs. Nicolin 's protests it got used for everything that needed good light , especially when the yard was wet . All of the rooms we passed on our way through the front of the house had fine furniture in them , beds and tables and chairs that John and Teddy , Steve 's twelve - year - old brother , had built in imitation of old time stuff . To me the whole house looked like something right out of books , and when I had said that to Tom he had agreed , saying it was more like houses used to be than any he 'd ever seen : “
78926	79021	79157	79157	he	351	" When we got to the dining room the kids ran out of it yelling . Mrs. Nicolin sighed and led us in . John and Teddy were sweeping up splinters and chunks of wood . Tom and John shook THE WILD SHORE 65 hands , something they would n't do unless one was visiting the other in his home . Through the big west windows we had a good view out to sea . Sunlight slanted in and lit the bottom of the east wall , and the wood dust in the air . “
79027	79102	79157	79157	he	351	” Mrs. Nicolin ordered . She pulled a hand through her hair , as if just standing in the room was making her dirty . John lifted his eyebrows in mock surprise , and tossed a scrap of wood in her direction . I left and went through the kitchen , which was stuffy with good smells , to find Steve . He was out back , cleaning the inside of the new churn . “
79107	79129	79130	79130	Jennings	249	” he asked . I decided to tell him , as I could n't think of any way to avoid it . “
79164	79174	79157	79157	he	351	” Steve let the churn fall to the grass . “
79183	79187	79157	79157	he	351	" I nodded . “
79195	79220	79157	79157	he	351	" He leaped over the churn , wiggled his arms in his victory shimmy dance . Suddenly he stopped and turned to examine me . “
79228	79229	79157	79157	he	351	” “
79237	79252	79234	79234	Tom	351	" His eyes narrowed , and his wide mobile mouth became straight and tight . “
79258	79259	79260	79260	I	0	” "
79288	79563	79564	79565	Mrs. N.	356	” He picked up the churn again , and thumped the last chips out of it . . Soon Mrs. Nicolin called us all into the dining room , and got us seated around the big oak table : John and her at the head , her grandmother Marie , who was ninety - five and simple - minded , Tom , Steve and Teddy and Emilia , who was thirteen , and very quiet and shy ; then me , and then the kids , Virginia and Joe the twins , and Carol and Judith , the babies of the family , back around the table next to Mrs. N. John lit the lamps on the table , while Mrs. N. and Emilia brought in the food . The yellow lamplight was in sharp contrast to the blue evening outside . Faint reflections of us all sprang to in the big west window . Emilia and Mrs. N. brought out plate after plate , until the tabletop was nearly invisible under them . Tom and I kicked each other under the table . Several of the plates were covered , and when John took off their tops steam puffed out , fragrant with the smell of chicken bubbling in a red sauce . There was 66 Kim Stanley Robinson a cabbage salad in a large wooden bowl , and soup in a porcelain tureen . There were plates of bread and tortillas , and plates covered with sliced tomatoes and eggs . There were jugs of goat 's milk and water . All of the smells made me drunk , and I said , “
79609	79620	79621	79621	He	357	" The Nicolins laughed at me , and Tom said , “
79636	79747	79627	79628	The Irish	384	" We passed the plates around following Mrs. Nicolin 's orders , and when our plates were piled high we started eating , and it was quiet for a time , except for the clink of cutlery on plates and bowls . Soon enough Marie wanted to talk to Tom , for she just picked at her chicken and greens . Tom bolted his food so quickly never stopping to chew , it seemed that he had time to talk between bites , and while he refilled his plate . Marie was pleased to see Tom , who was one of the few people outside the family she regularly recognized . “
79750	79755	79625	79625	Christy	350	” she piped loudly , “
79762	79792	79625	79625	Christy	350	” Virginia and Joe giggled . Tom snapped down a chunk of chicken like it was bread , leaned over and spoke directly into Marie 's nearly deaf ear : “
79798	79813	79796	79796	Marie	351	” Marie blinked wisely and nodded , while across from Tom Virginia giggled again . “
79830	79831	79796	79796	Marie	351	” “
79837	79843	79796	79796	Marie	351	” Mrs. N. said automatically . “
79849	79850	79796	79796	Marie	351	" “
79856	79866	79796	79796	Marie	351	" Tom gobbled down some of the fish soup . “
79872	79873	79796	79796	Marie	351	” "
79878	79879	79880	79880	Marie	351	" “
79888	79889	79880	79880	Marie	351	” “
79900	79901	79890	79890	She	2473	" “
79908	79909	79890	79890	She	2473	” “
79912	79922	79925	79925	Marie	351	" Marie cried , sensing the talk concerned her . “
79927	79934	79925	79925	Marie	351	" Tom said in her ear . “
79943	79944	79937	79937	she	2473	" "
79947	79952	79937	79937	she	2473	” Mrs. N. warned . “
79989	79994	79995	79995	You	350	” THE WILD SHORE 67 “
80002	80003	79995	79995	You	350	” “
80029	80045	80024	80024	we	2474	" He swallowed some more chicken , licking the sauce out of his moustache luxuriously . “
80066	80067	80068	80068	Yooks	359	” “
80072	80073	80068	80068	Yooks	359	” “
80076	80077	80068	80068	Yooks	359	” "
80082	80083	80068	80068	Yooks	359	” “
80088	80252	80068	80068	Yooks	359	” John growled , looking up from his plate . I saw Steve wince a little . He had n't said a word since we came inside , even when his mother talked directly at him . It made me a little apprehensive , but to tell the truth I was distracted by the food . I had started too quickly , and now I slowed down , chewing each mouthful into nothing but its taste . There were so many different flavors , aromas , textures ; each forkful of food had a different taste to it , and a mouthful of water after each swallow made my tongue fresh for more . I was getting full , but I could n't stop . John began to slow down , and talked to no one in particular about the warm current that had hit the coast with the previous day 's rain . Tom was still tossing it down , and Virginia said “
80264	80286	80262	80262	Tom	352	” He heard that one a lot , but he smiled at Virginia all the same , and the kids laughed . “
80292	80298	80262	80262	Tom	352	” Mrs. N. urged me , "
80303	80304	80068	80068	Yooks	359	” “
80309	80351	80068	80068	Yooks	359	" I replied . Little Carol started to cry , and Emilia got up to sit by her and spoon some soup into her mouth , or try to . It was getting pretty noisy , and Marie noticed and cried , “
80358	80426	80068	80068	Yooks	359	” which she knew would get her a laugh . Meanwhile Steve continued to eat silently , and I saw John notice it . I took another swallow of milk to reassure myself that everything would go all right . Over the remains of the meal we talked and nibbled equally . When Carol was calmed Emilia got up and started taking out dishes to the kitchen . “
80433	80480	80068	80068	Yooks	359	” Mrs. N. reminded Steve . Without a word he got up and carried plates away . When the table was almost cleared they brought out berries and cream , and another jug of milk . Tom kicked me , and flapped his eyebrows like wings . “
80486	80607	80484	80484	Christy	350	” he said piously . After we had feasted on berries and cream the kids were allowed to take Gran and scamper off , and John and Mrs. N. , 68 Kim Stanley Robinson Steve and Emilia and Tom and I sat back in our chairs , shifting them around to face the window . John got a bottle of brandy from a cabinet , and we contemplated our reflections as we sipped . We made a funny picture . Steve was n't talking tonight , and Emilia never talked , so the conversation was left to Tom and John , mostly , with an occasional word from Mrs. N. or me . John speculated some more about the current . “
80648	80704	80748	80748	they	1247	” None of us ventured a theory ( I was surprised to see Tom pass on an opportunity to discuss the weather ) , and we sat in silence . Mrs. N. began to knit , and Emilia wordlessly moved over to hold the yarn . Suddenly John knocked back the rest of his brandy . “
80714	80726	80708	80708	you	2481	” he asked Tom . The old man sipped his brandy . “
80820	80821	80814	80814	I	0	” “
80831	80836	80823	80823	they	1247	” Steve said darkly . “
80839	80843	80823	80823	they	1247	" Tom replied . “
80908	80914	80915	80915	I	0	" John shook his head . “
80924	80938	80915	80915	I	0	” The corners of Steve 's mouth went white . Tom said casually , “
81006	81007	81008	81008	Steve	351	" “
81010	81018	81008	81008	Steve	351	” John glared at the old man . "
81021	81032	81008	81008	Steve	351	" He glanced at Steve , looked back at Tom . “
81044	81049	81008	81008	Steve	351	" THE WILD SHORE 69 “
81058	81063	81050	81050	You	0	” Steve burst out . "
81084	81085	81073	81073	I	0	" "
81088	81150	81151	81151	Steve	351	" John said in his on - the - water voice . In the next room the sounds of the kids playing abruptly died . Steve had stood up , and now he jerked toward his father , who was still leaning back in his chair ; Steve 's hands were balled into fists , and his face was twisted up . "
81153	81171	81151	81151	Steve	351	” Mrs. Nicolin said quietly . John shifted in his chair to better stare up at Steve . "
81226	81227	81228	81228	I	0	” “
81238	81360	81231	81231	someone	5387	” Steve said desperately . But John just shook his head , the grim set of his mouth shifting to an angry down - curve . I shrank in my chair , frightened . So often it came to this between them ; they got right to the breaking point so fast that it seemed certain they would snap through one day . For a moment I was sure of it ; Steve 's hands clenched , John was ready to launch himself .... But once again Steve deferred . He turned on his heel and ran out the dining room . We heard the kitchen door slam open and shut . Mrs. Nicolin got up and refilled John 's glass . “
81377	81378	81381	81381	Christy	350	” “
81400	81415	81395	81395	People	5352	” He glanced at Tom , drank deeply , said in an annoyed voice , “
81439	81444	81427	81427	you	351	” Tom said mildly , “
81455	81456	81447	81447	you	2494	" “
81459	81473	81447	81447	you	2494	” John said for the last time , putting his bulk into it . "
81483	81484	81481	81481	Tom	351	" “
81493	81625	81489	81489	I	0	” Tom sipped his brandy and gave me an uncomfortable look . I imitated Emilia and pretended I was n't there , staring at the portrait of us all on the black glass of the window . We were a pretty unhappy looking group . The silence stretched on ; we heard the kids laughing at the other end of the house . Steve was long gone , on the beach , I figured . I thought about how he felt at that moment , and the fine meal in my stomach turned lumpy . Mrs. Nicolin , face tight with distress , tried to refill our glasses . I shook my head , and Tom covered his glass with his hand . He cleared his throat . 70 Kim Stanley Robinson “
81639	81643	81632	81632	I	0	” We stood . “
81649	81677	81647	81647	Christy	350	" Tom muttered to Mrs. N. She began to say goodbye as if nothing had happened ; Tom cut her off with a pained expression and said , “
81694	81737	81688	81688	I	0	” John grunted and waved a hand , lost in his thoughts . We all stood looking at him , a big man brooding in his chair , staring at his own colorless image , surrounded by all his goods and possessions .... “
81741	81750	81751	81751	I	0	” he said , as if releasing us . “
81775	81776	81777	81777	We	2500	” “
81780	81804	81777	81777	We	2500	” Tom thanked Mrs. N. again and we backed out the door . She followed us out . On the doorstep she said , “
81812	81813	81810	81810	Tom	351	” “
81822	81854	81820	81820	Christy	350	” We walked up the river path full of food , but glum and heavy - footed . Tom muttered under his breath and took swings at branches near the path . “
81873	81879	81905	81905	you	2499	" He raised his voice . “
81910	81911	81905	81905	you	2499	” "
81914	81915	81905	81905	you	2499	" “
81918	81927	81928	81928	I	0	" He started muttering again , sounding disgusted . “
81942	81943	81905	81905	you	2499	” “
81947	81954	81905	81905	you	2499	" Tom snapped . I did . “
81961	81979	81905	81905	you	2499	” he went on . Suddenly he stopped and grabbed my arm , swung me around violently . “
81984	81997	81905	81905	you	2499	" he cried , pointing across the river at the other bank . “
82000	82008	81905	81905	you	2499	” I protested , peering into the dark “
82091	82097	82070	82071	John Junior	361	" His voice was harsh . “
82156	82161	82189	82189	Steve	351	" THE WILD SHORE 71 “
82164	82181	82189	82189	Steve	351	” I said , uneasy at the strain in his voice . We started walking again . “
82197	82198	82189	82189	Steve	351	" “
82202	82229	82189	82189	Steve	351	” he said again , not as sharp as the first time . After a few steps he said quietly , as if talking to himself , “
82247	82248	82240	82240	We	2516	” "
82256	82319	82249	82249	I	0	” I said , irritated that he kept going back to the past . That was all we heard about : the past , the past , the God damned past . The explanation for everything that happened was contained in our past . A man could behave like a tyrant to his son , and what was his excuse ? History . "
82331	82401	82324	82324	you	0	" he told me , irritated himself . Watching him in the dark I saw marks of the past on him : the scars , the caved - in side of his face where he had no teeth left , his bent back . He reminded me of one of the trees high on the hills above us , gnarled by the constant onshore winds , riven by lightning . “
82518	82529	82505	82505	Rafe	292	” He paused to collect himself and remember his point . “
82576	82585	82611	82612	John Nicolin	278	” He snorted , spat at the river . “
82674	82707	82708	82708	He	278	“ Well , Nicolin had the answer . He went up into Clemente and looked in a telephone book , for God 's sake . Looked in the God damned yellow pages . ”
82717	82821	82708	82708	He	278	“ He found the listing for commercial fishing warehouses , took some men up there to look for them . First one 72 Kim Stanley Robinson we found was empty . Second one had been blown flat on the day . The third one we walked into was a warehouse full of nets . Steel cables , heavy nylon- it was great . And that was just the start . We used the phone book and map to find the boatyards in Orange County , because all of the harbors were clean empty , and we hauled some boats right down the freeway . ”
82822	82828	82872	82872	he	2527	“ What about the scavengers ? "
82829	82853	82708	82708	He	278	“ That was when there were n't too many scavengers , and there was n't any fight in the ones that were there . "
83150	83157	83158	83158	Rafe	292	“ One thing 's for sure , ”
83161	83192	83158	83158	Rafe	292	“ I walked with him by one of the scavengers ' geiger counters at a swap meet once , and that machine almost busted its bell . Scavengers took off .... "
83193	83196	83197	83197	Tom	351	“ Anyway , ”
83204	83355	83197	83197	Tom	351	“ John Nicolin did or directed everything that had to do with fishing , and doing it was what brought the people in this valley together , and made us a town . The second winter after he arrived was the first one no one died from hunger . Boy , you do n't know what that means . We ate dried fish till we were dead sick of it , but THE WILD SHORE 73 no one was dead dead . There 's been hard times since , but none to match those before Nicolin arrived . I admire him . So if he 's got fish on the brain , if he wo n't let his son leave it for a week or even a day , then that 's too bad . That 's the way he is now , and you 've got to understand it . ”
83356	83376	83474	83474	Tom	351	“ But it does n't matter how well fed he is , if he makes his son hate him . ”
83377	83445	83446	83446	I	0	“ Aye . But that 's not his intention . I know he does n't intend that . Remember John Junior . Could be , even if John himself does n't know it , he just wants to keep Steve where he can see him . To try and keep him safe . So that even the fishing is just a cover . I do n't know . ”
83541	83548	83550	83550	Tom	351	“ Steve'll make it another time , "
83552	83568	83550	83550	Tom	351	“ But us — well be off to San Diego on the next cloudy night . ”
83569	83572	83584	83584	Tom	351	“ Yeah . ”
83595	83599	83600	83600	he	351	“ Be ready ! ”
83739	83771	83734	83734	he	351	“ Just when you do n't want clear days they come blaring down . Come on , let 's use this one for what it was meant to be used for . ”

84091	84099	84088	84088	she	309	“ Have you been out body surfing ? "
84100	84109	84071	84071	her	309	“ Yeah . What brings you down here ? ”
84110	84123	84130	84130	she	309	“ Oh , I was looking for clams up on the flats . ”

84186	84203	84204	84204	She	309	“ The next cloudy night . Seems like the weather does n't want me to go . ”

84249	84266	84242	84242	she	309	“ It 's just so — well , you 're the best man to do it . "
84280	84288	84242	84242	she	309	“ How many of you are going ? "
84289	84295	84242	84242	she	309	" Just me and Tom . ”
84296	84304	84242	84242	she	309	“ But what about those San Diegans ? ”
84305	84318	84242	84242	she	309	“ Oh they 're going too . They 're taking us down . ”
84322	84331	84242	84242	she	309	“ Just those two who came up here ? ”
84332	84354	84355	84355	I	0	“ No , they have a whole crew of men waiting down the freeway where they stopped fixing up the tracks . "
84367	84386	84355	84355	I	0	“ So we have to go on a cloudy night , so the Japs wo n't see us . ”
84387	84391	84392	84392	She	309	“ My God . ”
84395	84400	84392	84392	She	309	“ It sounds dangerous . ”
84401	84411	84412	84412	I	0	" Oh no , I do n't think so . "
84447	84454	84455	84455	she	309	“ Not here on the beach , ”
84458	84469	84441	84441	she	309	“ Why , anyone on the cliff could see us . ”
84470	84476	84441	84441	she	309	“ No they could n't . ”
84477	84492	84493	84493	She	309	“ Oh yes they could , you know they could . Tell you what . "
84525	84546	84503	84503	I	0	“ When you get back from San Diego , maybe we could go up Swing Canyon and take some swings . ”
84570	84592	84593	84593	She	309	“ I have to be off now , really , my pa is going to be wondering where I got to . "

85204	85207	85209	85211	the short man	1367	“ Granted , ”
85213	85231	85209	85211	the short man	1367	“ And one of Onofre 's leaders . And this boy here is his most able assistant . ”
85289	85310	85280	85280	he	341	“ Get that fire out and get on the cars . I want to be in San Diego by sunup . "
85848	85857	85843	85843	he	351	“ The only way to travel , eh ? "
85883	85892	85893	85893	I	0	" How f - fast are we going ? ”
85911	85918	85919	85919	he	351	“ About thirty miles an hour , ”
85922	85947	85919	85919	he	351	“ Maybe thirty - five . It 's been a good long while since I 've gone this fast , I 'll tell you . "
85948	85954	85955	85955	I	0	“ Thirty miles an hour ! ”
85958	85963	85955	85955	I	0	“ Yeee - ow ! "
86010	86015	86016	86016	Jennings	249	“ Want to pull ? "

86240	86252	86230	86235	the men on the following car	2652	“ Hey up there ! Who you got on the bar ? "
86253	86263	86264	86268	The men on both cars	1418	" We know it ai n't Jennings doing that ! ”
86273	86278	86279	86281	one of them	5447	“ It is Jennings , "
86284	86296	86279	86281	one of them	5447	“ I did n't know you missed your wife that much ! "
86297	86307	86230	86235	the men on the following car	2652	" What are you worried she 's up to ? ”
86308	86318	86279	86281	one of them	5447	“ Better not waste all your pumping up here ! ”
86319	86331	86279	86281	one of them	5447	“ Throw us a tow rope if you feel that good ! ”
86332	86338	86339	86339	Lee	341	“ Slow it down some , "
86345	86365	86339	86339	Lee	341	“ We got a ways to go , do n't want to tire out those poor men back there . "
86527	86534	86535	86535	Jennings	249	“ Now comes the complicated part , ”
86670	86677	86678	86678	Jennings	249	“ That 's our bridge foundation , ”
86694	86716	86686	86686	Lee	341	" It 's all that 's left of the old bridge , which must have burned when the water was high . ”
86717	86727	86728	86728	Tom	351	“ More likely the Pendleton bomb knocked it down , ”
86731	86744	86728	86728	Tom	351	“ I doubt the river was ever higher than it is now . ”
86745	86753	86754	86754	Jennings	249	" You 've got a point there , ”
86757	86841	86754	86754	Jennings	249	“ Anyway , the pilings are in pretty good shape . We leveled them , and brought up some beams that sit over the pilings sideways , like lintels . Then we set rail over the beams at the right gauge , and roll the cars over , and haul all the beams and rail to the other bank after us . It 's a lot of work , but with the material hidden no one can tell we 're crossing this bridge . ”
86843	86847	86848	86848	Tom	351	“ Very ingenious , "
87063	87094	87057	87057	Lee	341	“ Someone 's going to have to swim over and clear that pulley . We ca n't mess with carrying the beams out ; they 're too heavy to carry . ”

87167	87174	87175	87175	I	0	“ Sure I 'll do it , "
87178	87189	87175	87175	I	0	“ I 'm probably the best swimmer here , anyway . ”
87190	87197	87198	87198	Tom	351	“ He 's right about that , ”
87201	87216	87198	87198	Tom	351	“ He and his friends go out swimming in surf higher than your head . ”
87217	87221	87222	87222	Jennings	249	“ Good man , ”
87226	87286	87222	87222	Jennings	249	“ You see , Henry , we 've swum this river many times , but it 's not easy . You 're best off pulling yourself over with the rope ; that way you wo n't be carried downstream . Just get over there and clear that pulley , and we 'll have this bridge up in no time . ”
87892	87895	87896	87896	I	0	“ Chinga ! ”
87899	87905	87896	87896	I	0	“ Shit ! Pinché buey ! "
87906	87909	87910	87910	they	2698	" Hey ! "
87917	87924	87910	87910	they	2698	“ Anything wrong · out there ? ”
87925	87928	87929	87929	Tom	351	“ Henry ! ”

87941	87946	87937	87937	I	0	“ I 'm okay ! ”
88246	88262	88263	88263	Tom	351	“ The first time they did this it must have been a lot of trouble , ”
88280	88305	88263	88263	Tom	351	" I guess it must hold those cars , but I sure would n't have wanted to be the first to take one across . "
88306	88317	88318	88318	I	0	“ They look like they know what they 're doing , ”
88321	88344	88318	88318	I	0	“ Yeah . Tough work in the dark . Too bad they ca n't just build a bridge and leave it there . "
88345	88359	88360	88360	I	0	“ That 's what I was thinking . I ca n't believe the ... "
88369	88382	88360	88360	I	0	“ That they 'd actually bomb a little bridge like this one . "
88383	88387	88392	88392	Tom	351	" I know . ”
88398	88449	88450	88450	Jennings	249	“ But I do n't think these folks are lying , or going to all this trouble for nothing . I guess whoever 's up there is keeping the existing communities separated , like Jennings said . But I was n't aware of it . It 's a bad sign . "
88465	88470	88471	88471	he	249	“ Just about done , ”
88474	88505	88471	88471	he	249	“ You men should walk across now . We take the cars over as empty as we can get them , although it 's just a precaution , you understand . ”
88506	88511	88513	88513	Tom	351	“ That we do , ”
88615	88687	88603	88603	Jennings	249	“ It 's true . We ca n't keep those ties perfectly flat . It makes for a little yaw when you cross , but nothing worse than that . At least not so far . We 'll see if Lee has to go for a swim like you did when he brings the first car over . I hope not - it 's still a fair walk to San Diego . "
88802	88806	88799	88800	the men	772	“ All right , ”
88808	88815	88799	88800	the men	772	“ That was a good one , ”
88877	88881	88883	88883	Tom	351	“ Very ingenious , "
88885	88896	88883	88883	Tom	351	“ Very clever , very dangerous , very well done . ”
88897	88904	88905	88905	I	0	“ Looked simple enough to me , ”
88950	88959	88960	88960	Jennings	249	“ The next one 's a lot easier , ”
89033	89045	89046	89046	Jennings	249	" This kid swims and pumps like a good resistance man , "
89154	89161	89147	89147	I	0	“ We at the next river ? ”
89162	89165	89166	89166	Tom	351	“ No , "
89170	89174	89175	89175	He	351	“ Look there . ”
89285	89290	89291	89291	Lee	341	“ Kill the lanterns , ”
89351	89365	89366	89366	Jennings	249	“ They do n't come so close to the land in inhabited areas , ”
89376	89383	89366	89366	Jennings	249	" That was a rare sighting . ”
89808	89812	89813	89813	Jennings	249	“ San Elijo , ”
89889	89907	89886	89886	Tom	351	“ How do you cross it ? Pretty long bridge to build , would n't you say ? ”
89911	89928	89908	89908	Jennings	249	“ We go around it . We 've set rails on the roads permanently . Down here they”-thrusting
89931	89936	90006	90006	Lee	341	skyward_"don't seem to mind . ”
89977	89997	89998	89998	Tom	351	" Have you been able to determine how far away from San Diego you can build without disturbing them ? ”
90028	90076	90014	90014	Jennings	249	“ Lee here has a theory that there are very strict and regular limits to what we can do before they intervene - a matter of isolating each of the old counties , to the extent they can . Is n't that what you said , Lee ? ”
90094	90111	90112	90112	Jennings	249	“ Me , I 'm not so sure I do n't agree more with the Mayor , ”
90122	90172	90112	90112	Jennings	249	“ The Mayor says there is no rhyme nor reason to what they do ; madmen watch us from space , he says , and control what we can and ca n't do . He really gets upset . We 're like flies to the gods , he says . "
90173	90186	90187	90187	Tom	351	“ Like flies to wanton boys are we to the gods , ' ”
90190	90200	90187	90187	Tom	351	“ Exactly . Madmen , looking down on us . "
90206	90260	90203	90203	his	341	“ There 's more to it than that . It 's a question of how much they see . But their reaction is governed by rules . I imagine it 's a charter from the United Nations or some such thing , telling the Japs out there what to do . In fact — "
90279	90294	90295	90295	Jennings	249	“ Oh , no question they 've got cameras that can image a man , ”
90299	90442	90295	90295	Jennings	249	“ So it 's not a question of how much they can see . The question is , how much they will notice . Now , we 've made changes on that rail line north 90 Kim Stanley Robinson that ca n't be hid . The bridges are the same , but we 've cleared some brush off the tracks , for instance . So hiding the bridge work may be a waste of time . We 're not invisible , like I told the Mayor , though I 'm not sure he listened . We 're just unobtrusive . Now the watchers may pore over every photograph they take , or they may have machines scanning for major changes , we do n't know . This line north should be a good test of their attention , if you ask me . ”
90671	90677	90678	90678	Jennings	249	“ Welcome to San Diego ! ”
90690	90708	90678	90678	Jennings	249	“ Or to University City , to be more exact . Care to join us for breakfast ? ”
90817	90825	90814	90814	I	0	“ Is this the Mayor 's house ? ”
90854	90959	90839	90839	Jennings	249	“ You 've proved yourself tonight , Henry my boy . We are n't laughing at you ; it 's just ... well , when you see the Mayor 's place , you 'll understand why . This here is my house . Come on in and clean up and meet the wife , and we 'll have a good meal to celebrate your arrival . ' Chapter Seven • After breakfast Tom and I slept for most of the day , on old couches in the Jennings ' front room . Late in the day Jennings bustled in and woke us , saying , “
90995	90996	90986	90986	he	5274	” “
91005	91031	90986	90986	he	5274	” Jennings ' wife said as she looked over his shoulder at us . She looked remarkably like him , short , thick and cheerful . “
91044	91213	91036	91036	I	0	” Tom and I followed her to it , and relieved ourselves in a working water toilet . When we were done Jennings hustled us outside . Lee and the short man were already on one of the train cars . We joined them , and they pumped us south . Apparently in the light of day the tubby man felt more sociable , and he introduced himself as Abe Tonklin . We rattled over tracks laid on the cracked concrete of another freeway , under a canopy of torrey pine and eucalyptus , redwood and oak . The car crunched swiftly through alternating shadows and slanted beams of sunlight , and now and then we 93 94 Kim Stanley Robinson passed a big clearing in the forest , packed with crops , usually corn . Once I waved at a man standing in one of these yellowy green expanses , and then realized he was a scarecrow . Over the roar of wheel on rail Jennings shouted , “
91219	91429	91036	91036	I	0	” We topped a rise and below us was a narrow lake , stretching right to left in front of us . It was as if a marsh similar to the ones to the north had flooded . Scattered on the lake 's surface were towering buildings , skyscrapers , at least a dozen of them . One of them , to the left , was a giant circular wall . And in the middle of the lake stood a piece of freeway , up on concrete pilings above the water . A white house stood on this platform . Flying above this house I could make out a little American flag , snapping in the breeze . I looked at Tom , my mouth hanging open in amazement . Tom 's eyes were big . I took in the sight again . Flanked by forested hills , lit by the low sun , the long lake and its fantastic collection of drowned and ruined giants was the most impressive remnant of the old time I had ever laid eyes on . They were so big ! Once again I had that feeling - like a hand squeezing my heart — that I knew what it had been like ..... “
91438	91442	91433	91434	the Mayor	5274	” Jennings said . “
91451	91455	91444	91444	God	251	" Tom said . “
91460	91604	91613	91613	they	2826	” Jennings replied , as proudly as if he 'd made it all himself . Tom shook his head and laughed in a dumbfounded way . The tracks came to an end , and Lee braked the car with the usual nerve - jangling screech . We got off and followed the San Diegans down the freeway . It led right into the lake and disappeared . The piece of freeway standing on stilts in the lake 's center was on a line with it , and in a notch of the hills forming the opposite shore I saw the gray concrete rising out of the lake again . All at once I understood that the section of freeway on stilts in the lake was all that was left of a bridge that had spanned the whole valley . Rather than have their road "
91673	91677	91678	91678	Lee	341	“ You okay ? ”
91682	91695	91678	91678	Lee	341	“ Huh ? Yeah , sure . Just looking at the lake . ”
91696	91713	91719	91719	Lee	341	“ Quite a sight . Maybe we can take a sail around it in the morning . ”
91796	91885	91886	91886	Tom	289	“ The rains washed mountains of dirt down to the rivermouth , which was bracketed by a pair of long jetties and crossed by several roads — just generally obstructed . So the dirt stuck there and formed a plug . A big dam . What ? There 's still a channel through to the ocean , but it 's on top of the plug , so we got the lake back here . It 's well above sea level . Runs all the way to El Cajon . "
91889	91914	91886	91886	Tom	289	“ Ha ! We always said a good rain would flood this valley , but this . ... What about the overpass out here ? "
91915	91971	91775	91775	Abe	366	“ The first floods were pretty violent , they say , and the sides of the hills got ripped away , so the towers holding the road fell . Only the center ones held . We blasted the wreckage hanging from the center section so it would look cleaner . More planned , you know . "
91972	91975	91787	91787	Jennings	249	" Sure . ”
92171	92176	92177	92177	Lee	341	“ We 're late , ”
92180	92185	92177	92177	Lee	341	“ Let 's go . ”
92588	92596	92597	92597	he	5274	“ Jennings , who are these men ? ”
92643	92647	92648	92649	the Mayor	5274	“ Timothy Danforth , ”
92654	92661	92648	92649	the Mayor	5274	“ Mayor of this fine town . "
92733	92747	92728	92728	He	5274	“ I am told you are not the elected leader of San Onofre ? "
92748	92757	92758	92758	Tom	289	“ Onofre does n't have an elected leader , ”
92761	92770	92771	92772	the Mayor	5274	“ But you hold some sort of authority ? "
92790	92798	92799	92799	he	289	“ Nice view you 've got here , ”
92877	92885	92886	92887	the Mayor	5274	" Always good to meet another neighbor , ”
92895	92917	92886	92887	the Mayor	5274	“ We 'll celebrate with a meal out here , if you like . It should be a warm enough evening . ”
92936	92950	92951	92951	His	5274	“ Tell me , are you one who lived in the old time ? ”
92969	92975	92976	92976	Tom	289	" How did you guess ? "
92994	93028	92988	92988	Danforth	368	“ It 's an honor to meet you , sir . There are n't many of you left , especially in such good health . You 're an inspiration to all of us . "
93036	93039	93030	93030	Tom	289	“ Really ? ”
93040	93044	93045	93046	the Mayor	5274	" An inspiration , "
93050	93088	93045	93046	the Mayor	5274	“ A monument , so to speak . A reminder of what we 're striving for in these most difficult of times . I find that old timers like you understand better what we 're striving for . ”
93090	93094	93096	93096	Tom	289	“ Which is ? ”
93126	93133	93134	93134	he	5274	“ Well , come sit down , ”
93606	93611	93612	93612	I	0	“ It was nothing , ”
93616	93629	93612	93612	I	0	" I was anxious to get down here and see this town . "
93665	93681	93682	93683	the Mayor	5274	“ What 's the shortest time it would take you to train up to Onofre ? ”
93772	93809	93767	93767	Lee	341	“ Last night it took about eight hours , from our stopping point up there to University City . That 's about as fast as it could be done , unless we left the bridges up . ”
93810	93817	93818	93818	Danforth	368	“ We ca n't do that . ”
93825	93847	93818	93818	Danforth	368	“ I guess not . Anyway , another fifteen minutes to Onofre . The track 's in good shape to there . ”
93852	93858	93859	93859	Jennings	249	“ And beyond as well , ”
93872	93881	93882	93882	he	5274	“ Let 's talk about that after dinner , "
93940	93947	93948	93948	he	289	“ Where do you get these ? ”
93955	93969	93951	93952	The Mayor	5274	“ Wait till after the grace , and Ben here will tell you . "
94025	94058	94019	94020	The Mayor	5274	“ Dear Lord , we eat this food you have provided us in order to make us strong in the service of you and of the United States of America . Amen . ”
94108	94117	94103	94103	Ben	369	“ We get the shrimp from the south . "
94118	94126	94019	94020	The Mayor	5274	" I thought the border was closed . ”
94127	94209	94211	94211	he	289	“ Oh , it is . Definitely . Not the old border , though . Tijuana is no more than a battleground for rats and cats . About five miles south of that is the new border . It 's made of barbed wire fences , and a bulldozed strip on each side of it three hundred yards wide . And guard towers , and lights at night . I 've never heard of a single person that got over it . ”
94227	94285	94222	94222	their	6072	" There 's a jetty where the fence hits the beach , too , and beyond that guard boats . But they 're Mexican guard boats , you see . The Japanese have the coast right down to the border , but beyond that the Mexicans take over . They do n't do too good a job . ”
94286	94292	94293	94293	Danforth	368	" Neither do the Japs , ”
94296	94370	94293	94293	Danforth	368	“ True . Anyway , the Mexican guard boats are there , but it 's easy to get past them , and once past them the fishing boats will sell you anything they have or can get . We 're just another customer as far as they 're concerned . Except they know they have us over a barrel , so they squeeze us every trade . But we get what we want . "
94375	94380	94382	94382	Tom	289	“ Which is shrimp ? "
94391	94400	94386	94386	His	289	“ Sure . Do n't you like it ? ”
94401	94408	94293	94293	Danforth	368	“ What do the Mexicans want ? ”
94409	94419	94386	94386	His	289	“ Gun parts , mostly . Souvenirs . Junk . ”
94420	94425	94426	94426	Danforth	368	“ Mexicans love junk , ”
94434	94457	94426	94426	Danforth	368	“ But we 'll sell them something different someday . Put them back where they belong , like it used to be . ”
94476	94487	94473	94473	he	2950	“ Did you live around here in the old time ? "
94488	94503	94426	94426	Danforth	368	“ Up in Orange County , mostly . I came down here to school . "
94504	94511	94473	94473	he	2950	" Changed , has n't it ? ”
94512	94515	94516	94516	Tom	289	" Sure . ”
94525	94530	94531	94531	He	289	“ Everything 's changed . "
94552	94566	94541	94541	I	0	“ I imagine Orange County was pretty built up in the old time . ”
94567	94579	94580	94581	The Mayor	5274	“ About like San Diego . Or a little more so . "
94744	94748	94750	94750	Danforth	368	“ You know , "
94758	94774	94750	94750	Danforth	368	" the Japanese are landing up there in your old home territory , these days . ”
94775	94779	94780	94780	Tom	289	“ That so ? ”
94823	94838	94839	94839	Tom	289	“ You have n't seen any of them in Onofre ? Or any signs ? ”
94876	94889	94890	94891	the Mayor	5274	“ They 're interested in looking at the ruins of old America , ”
94894	94897	94898	94898	Tom	289	" They ? ”
94905	94937	94898	94898	Tom	289	“ Mostly Japanese , although there are other nationalities too . But the Japanese , who were given the charter to guard our west coast , make up most of them . "
94938	94945	94946	94946	Tom	289	“ Who guards the other coasts ? ”
94959	94973	94946	94946	Tom	289	“ Canada was assigned the east coast , the Mexicans the Gulf Coast . "
94974	94983	94984	94984	Ben	369	" They 're supposed to be neutral powers , ”
94987	95004	94984	94984	Ben	369	“ Although in the world today the very idea of a neutral power is a joke . "
95010	95050	94984	94984	Ben	369	“ Japanese own the offshore islands here , and Hawaii . It 's easiest for the rich Japanese to get to Hawaii , and then here , but we 're told tourists of all nationalities want to try it . "
95051	95059	95060	95060	Tom	289	" How do you know all this ? ”
95074	95086	95070	95071	Proudly Danforth	371	“ We 've sent men to Catalina to spy it out . ”
95100	95110	95070	95071	Proudly Danforth	371	“ So what happened ? Have we been quarantined ? "
95122	95171	95118	95119	the Mayor	5274	“ The Russians did it . So we 've been told . Of course it 's obvious . Who else was going to come up with two thousand neutron bombs ? Most countries could n't even afford the vans those things were hidden in when they went off . ”
95211	95219	95220	95221	the Mayor	5274	“ That was how they got us , ”
95224	95277	95220	95221	the Mayor	5274	“ Did n't you know ? They hid the bombs in Chevy vans , drove the vans into the centers of the two thousand largest cities , and parked them there . Then the bombs all went off at once . No warning . You know , no missiles coming or anything . ”
95292	95297	95298	95298	Ben	369	“ After the day , ”
95314	95382	95298	95298	Ben	369	“ the U.N. reconvened in Geneva . Everyone was terrified of the Soviet Union , especially the nations with nuclear weapons , naturally . Russia suggested we be made off 102 Kim Stanley Robinson limits for a century , to avoid any conflict over us . A world preserve , they said . Clearly punitive , but who was going to argue ? So here we are . "
95383	95386	95387	95387	Tom	289	“ Interesting , "
95390	95405	95406	95406	He	289	“ But I 've heard a lot of speculation in the last fifty years . "
95411	95465	95406	95406	He	289	“ Seems to me we 're like the Japanese themselves were after Hiroshima . They did n't even know what hit them , did you know that ? They thought maybe we had dropped manganese on the electric train tracks , and started a fire . Pitiful . And we 're no better . ”
95466	95471	95472	95473	the Mayor	5274	“ What 's Hiroshima ? "
95490	95530	95481	95481	Ben	369	“ We 've had men on Catalina for months at a time . And well , I 'll send you over to Wentworth 's tomorrow . He 'll tell you . We know what happened , more or less . "
95531	95535	95537	95538	the Mayor	5274	“ Enough history , "
95540	95632	95537	95538	the Mayor	5274	“ What 's important is the here and now . The Japanese in Avalon are getting corrupt . Rich Japanese want to visit America and do some sight - seeing . It 's the latest adventure . They come to Avalon and contact people who will take them to the mainland . Those people , some of them Americans , sail them in past the coastal patrol at night , into Newport Beach or Dana Point . We 've heard there are hundreds of them in Hawaii waiting to do it . "
95633	95640	95641	95641	Tom	289	“ That 's what you said . ”
95673	95680	95681	95681	he	5274	“ Tell the band to play ! "
95872	95920	95856	95856	Danforth	371	“ All done stuffing yourselves ? Why do n't you get down there and dance ? This is a celebration ! Get THE WILD SHORE 103 down there and mingle with the folks , and Ben and I will talk further with our guests from the north . "
95957	95969	95970	95970	Danforth	371	“ I have an excellent bottle of tequila in my study , ”
95975	95987	95970	95970	Danforth	371	“ Let 's go in there and give some a try . "
96139	96148	96134	96134	he	371	“ To the friendship of our two communities . "
96256	96263	96245	96245	He	5274	“ So what do you think ? "
96264	96268	96269	96269	Tom	289	“ Of what ? ”
96272	96278	96269	96269	Tom	289	“ Of the world situation ? ”
96282	96342	96279	96279	Tom	289	“ I just heard about it . You folks know a lot more than we did . If it 's all true . We know there are Orientals out there on Catalina . Their bodies wash up on our beach occasionally . Beyond that , all we 've heard is swap meet talk , and that changes every month . "
96343	96352	96353	96353	Danforth	371	“ You 've had Japanese bodies washing up ? ”
96356	96362	96353	96353	Danforth	371	“ We call them Chinese . ”
96369	96372	96366	96366	his	5274	“ Japanese . ”
96373	96388	96389	96389	Tom	289	“ So that coast guard is shooting up some of the illegal landing parties ? ”
96399	96412	96396	96396	his	5274	“ The coast guard is paid off . It was n't them . ”
96421	96426	96413	96413	He	5274	“ It was us . ”
96431	96436	96393	96394	the Mayor	5274	“ How 's that ? ”
96437	96442	96443	96444	the Mayor	5274	“ It was us ! "
96461	96499	96450	96450	He	5274	“ We sail up off Newport and Dana Point , on foggy nights or nights when we 've been tipped off that they 're coming , and we ambush them . Kill as many as we can . ”
96509	96512	96513	96513	he	289	“ Why ? ”
96517	96520	96513	96513	he	289	" Why ? ”
96530	96542	96521	96522	The Mayor	5274	" You 're an old timer - you ask me why ? ”
96543	96546	96570	96570	his	5274	" Sure . ”
96547	96560	96561	96561	He	5274	“ Because we are n't a zoo here , that 's why ! ”
96603	96611	96612	96612	he	5274	“ They blew our country to pieces , ”
96635	96640	96641	96641	He	5274	“ They killed it . ”
96646	96709	96643	96643	his	5274	“ There 's nothing we can do about that now . But they ca n't come sight - seeing in the ruins . No . Not while there are Americans left alive . We are n't animals in a cage to be looked at . We 'll make them learn that if they set foot on our soil , they 're dead . "
96725	96770	96771	96771	He	5274	“ No stepping into the cages in this zoo . When word gets around that no one ever comes back from a visit to America , they 'll stop coming . There wo n't be any more customers for that scum north of you . ”
96775	96794	96771	96771	He	5274	“ Did you know there are scavengers in Orange County arranging to give guided tours to the Japs ? ”
96795	96801	96802	96802	Tom	289	“ I 'm not surprised , ”
96805	96823	96824	96824	He	5274	“ Well I am . Those people are scum . They are traitors to the United States . ”
96832	96872	96824	96824	He	5274	“ If every American joined the resistance , no one could land on our soil . We 'd be left alone , and the rebuilding could get on . But we all have to be part of the resistance . ”
96873	96883	96884	96884	Tom	289	“ I did n't know there was a resistance , ”
96906	96919	96899	96899	He	5274	“ That 's what we brought you here to tell you about ! ”
96945	96951	96952	96952	Ben	369	“ Tell him , Ben . ”
96960	97020	96952	96952	Ben	369	“ When we got to the Salton Sea we learned about it . The American resistance . Although usually they just called it the resistance . THE WILD SHORE 105 The headquarters are in Salt Lake City , and there are military centers in the old Strategic Air Command quarters under Cheyenne , Wyoming , and under Mount Rushmore . ”
97021	97026	97027	97027	Tom	289	“ Under Mount Rushmore ? ”
97046	97065	97040	97041	the Mayor	5274	“ That 's right . That 's where the secret military headquarters of the United States always was . ”
97066	97072	97073	97073	Tom	289	" I did n't know , "
97084	97112	97113	97113	He	5274	“ There are organizations all across the country , but it 's all one group really , and the goal is the same . To rebuild America . "
97121	97126	97128	97129	the Mayor	5274	" To rebuild America , ”
97261	97289	97258	97258	he	5274	“ To make America great again , to make it what it was before the war , the best nation on Earth . That 's our goal . ”
97300	97397	97290	97290	He	5274	“ We 'd be back to that already if we had retaliated against the Soviets . If President Eliot - traitor , coward!hadn't refused to defend us . But we 'll still do it . We 'll work hard , we 'll pray hard , we 'll hide our weapons from the satellites . They 're inventing new ones in Salt Lake and Cheyenne , we 're told . And one day ... one day we 'll spring out on the world again like a tiger . A tiger from the depths of the pit . ... "
97491	97599	97482	97482	his	5274	“ That 's what I wanted to talk to you about , Barnard . The largest resistance group on this coast is centered around Santa Barbara , we 've heard . We met some of them out at the Salton Sea . We need to connect with them , and present a unified opposition to the 106 Kim Stanley Robinson Japanese on Catalina and the Santa Barbara islands . The first part of that task is to rid Orange County and Los Angeles of all Japanese tourists , and the traitors who guide them . So we need you . We need Onofre to join the resistance . ”
97600	97608	97609	97609	Tom	351	“ I ca n't speak for them , ”
97651	97669	97646	97646	Tom	351	“ It sounds ... well , I do n't know if we 'll want in or not . ”
97670	97678	97679	97680	the Mayor	5274	“ You 've got to want in , ”
97690	97750	97679	97680	the Mayor	5274	“ This is more important than what you want . You tell them they can make this country what it used to be . They can help . But we all have to work together . The day will come . Another Pax Americana , cars and airplanes , rockets to the moon , telephones . A unified country . ”
97762	97782	97759	97759	he	5274	“ You go back up there and tell your valley that they join the resistance or they oppose it . "
97783	97793	97794	97794	Tom	351	“ Not a very neighborly way of putting it , ”
97802	97814	97797	97797	his	351	“ Put it any way you please ! Just tell them . ”
97815	97847	97797	97797	his	351	“ I 'll tell them . But they 'll want to know just exactly what you want of them . And I ca n't guarantee what they 'll say to it . ”
97849	97862	97797	97797	his	351	“ No one 's asking you to guarantee anything . They 'll know "
97867	97882	97883	97883	I	0	” The Mayor took a long look at Tom , his little eyes bright . “
97903	97904	97905	97905	I	0	” "
97913	97917	97905	97905	I	0	" Tom said . “
97921	97949	97905	97905	I	0	” · The Mayor circled the desk and bent over Tom 's chair , looked at Tom . With both hands he trapped one of Tom 's . “
97961	97966	97958	97959	old man	3013	" he said hoarsely . "
98007	98025	98028	98028	Ben	369	” Tom pulled his hand away . The Mayor straightened up and limped back around the desk . “
98050	98058	98047	98047	you	369	” Ben nodded and smiled at us . “
98070	98074	98061	98061	you	3014	” Danforth said , “
98095	98106	98085	98086	the folks	6974	” We agreed that we did . THE WILD SHORE 107 “
98123	98151	98116	98116	me	0	" We stood and followed him out of the room . He bobbed down the hallway to another door , and pulled a key from his vest . “
98163	98222	98116	98116	me	0	" He unlocked the door , and we followed him into the room , which contained nothing but machine parts , scattered over three tables . On the biggest table was a metal box as big as a boat locker , covered with knobs and dials and gauges , with wires trailing out of it from two openings . “
98227	98231	98116	98116	me	0	” Tom said . "
98234	98247	98116	98116	me	0	” said Ben , beaming with approval at Tom 's good guess . “
98263	98268	98251	98257	a man coming from the Salton Sea	3021	" the Mayor whispered . “
98301	98396	98116	98116	me	0	” So we stood there and stared at it for a while , and then tiptoed out of the room . When the Mayor was done locking the door we went outside onto the freeway , where the band was still playing . Instantly the Mayor was surrounded by young women who wanted a dance with him . Tom wandered off toward the west railing , and I went for the drink table . The man behind the table recognized me ; he had helped dock our boat when we arrived at the island . “
98403	98553	98554	98554	Tom	289	” he declared , and poured me a cup of tequila punch . I took it and walked in circles around the dance floor . The women dancing with the Mayor held close to him and danced in slow circles , unlike the polka dancing going on around them . I was feeling the drink . The music , the electric lights glaring off the concrete , the bright rugs thrown here and there , the cool breeze , the night sky , the eerie ruined skyscrapers rising blackly from the murk around us — the incredible news of the American resistance — it all combined to put me in a blaze of excitement . I was on the edge of a new world , ' truly . I twisted through the crowd to Tom , who was leaning against the fat railing , looking down at the water . “
98566	98567	98554	98554	Tom	289	” “
98574	98641	98554	98554	Tom	289	” he said quietly . So I walked back over to the band , subdued for a moment . But it did n't last . The girl dancing with the Mayor was the blond who had served our table at the feast . When she gave way to another girl I hurried out among the dancers and swept her into a hug . 108 Kim Stanley Robinson “
98647	98652	98653	98653	I	0	” I asked her . “
98659	98660	98653	98653	I	0	" "
98664	98671	98653	98653	I	0	" she said , and laughed . “
98690	98691	98672	98672	You	0	” "
98697	98716	98672	98672	You	0	” I said as I awkwardly swept her into the polka . It made me a little dizzy . “
98736	98737	98728	98728	I	0	” “
98740	98741	98728	98728	I	0	” "

98842	98965	98826	98826	I	0	" I kissed her briefly , and we danced three or four songs , until my dizziness returned and I had trouble with my bearings . She accompanied me to the tables , and we sat and talked . I chattered on like the most extravagant liar in California ; Nicolin himself could n't have beat me that night , and the girl laughed and laughed . Later on Jennings and Tom came by , and I was sorry to see them . Jennings said he was taking us to our night 's lodgings on the other end of the platform . Reluctantly I said goodnight to the girl , and followed them drunkenly down the freeway south , singing to myself , “
98972	99015	98826	98826	I	0	" and greeting most of the people we passed . Jennings installed us in one of the bungalows at the south end of the platform , and I chattered at the silent Tom for two or three minutes before I passed out . “
99031	99143	99022	99022	I	0	” Chapter Eight Shotgun blasts woke us up the next morning . Jumping up to look out the door of our little bungalow , we discovered that the Mayor and several of his men were taking target practice , shooting at plates that one of them was throwing out over the lake . The man threw the plate arched out — the shooter aimed - bam ! — a flat sound like two wet planks slapping together . About one in every three plates burst into white splinters . The rest clipped the sparkling surface of the lake and disappeared . Tom shook his head disdainfully as he regarded this exercise . “
99154	99348	99144	99144	They	3040	” he said . Jennings , standing to one side and watching the action , turned and saw us in our doorway . He came over and led us to one of the tables set outside the big house . There in the tangy clouds of gunpowder smoke we had a breakfast of bread and milk . Between the bangs of the gun I could hear the American flag snapping smartly in the fresh morning breeze . I watched it waving over the house ; I watched the target practice . Every time a plate exploded the men hooted and talked 109 110 Kim Stanley Robinson it over . The Mayor was a good shot ; he seldom missed , which may have been the result of taking his turn often . The rest of his men might as well have been dumping those plates into the lake by the boxful . When we were done eating the Mayor gave his shotgun to one of the men around him , and clumped over to us . He looked a bit smaller in the sunlight than he had under the lanterns and electric lights . "
99373	99374	99377	99377	he	389	” “
99379	99389	99377	99377	he	389	" Tom asked , without any pretense of politeness . “
99434	99450	99419	99419	Jennings	249	” He sat down across from us and leaned his thick forearms on the table . "

99652	99661	99663	99664	The Mayor	5274	" What if we do n't want to ? ”
99699	99709	99710	99710	Danforth	344	“ I ca n't figure you , old man , "
99713	99726	99710	99710	Danforth	344	“ You just take my message to the people in your valley . "
99727	99747	99669	99669	He	5274	" I 'll tell them what you 've told me , and we 'll let you know our decision . ”
99748	99759	99760	99760	He	344	“ Good enough . I 'll be seeing you again . ”
99776	99786	99787	99787	Jennings	249	“ I think he 's done talking to you , ”
99798	99804	99805	99805	He	249	“ We can be off . ”
99908	99916	99917	99917	Tom	289	“ Quite a terminal you have there , "

100317	100322	100323	100323	Jennings	249	“ What 's that ? ”
100339	100382	100335	100335	Tom	289	“ This town was everything but itself . Nothing but money . Paper houses ; this hill sure looks better with 112 Kim Stanley Robinson all that shit washed away . I wish they could see it now , hee hee hee . ”
100566	100569	100570	100570	Tom	289	“ Paint , "
100573	100593	100570	100570	Tom	289	“ What a good idea . But all the paint I 've seen lately has been hard as rock . ”
100594	100603	100604	100604	Jennings	249	“ Wentworth has a way to liquefy it , ”
100607	100619	100604	100604	Jennings	249	" Same way he liquefies old ink , he tells me . ”
100621	100627	100628	100628	I	0	" Who is this Wentworth ? "
100631	100637	100639	100639	Jennings	249	“ Come and find out , ”
100831	100836	100837	100837	he	3126	" Jennings , Lee , ”
100852	100860	100837	100837	he	3126	" What brings you out here today ? "
100861	100907	100915	100915	He	351	“ Douglas , this here is Tom Barnard , a ... an elder of Onofre Valley , up the coast . We brought him down on the new tracks . THE WILD SHORE 113 Tom , this is Douglas Wentworth , San Diego 's bookmaker . "
100908	100911	100912	100912	Tom	351	“ Bookmaker , ”
100921	100932	100915	100915	He	351	" I 'm happy to meet a bookmaker , sir . ”
100934	100942	100915	100915	He	351	" You take an interest in books ? ”
100943	100980	100915	100915	He	351	" I surely do . I was a lawyer once , and had to read the worst kind of books . Now I 'm free to read what I like , when I can find it . ”
100981	100988	100989	100989	Wentworth	389	" You have an extensive collection ? ”
101006	101026	100989	100989	Wentworth	389	“ No sir . Fifty volumes or so , but I keep trading them with our neighbors for others . ”
101027	101040	101041	101041	His	389	“ Ah . And you , young man - do you read ? ”
101060	101083	100989	100989	Wentworth	389	“ Yes , sir . Tom taught me how , and now that I can I enjoy it more than almost anything . "
101089	101140	101084	101085	Mr. Wentworth	396	“ It 's refreshing to hear that San Onofre is a literate community . Perhaps you 'd like to take a tour of our establishment ? I can take a few moments from the work here , and we do have a modest printing arrangement that might be of interest . "
101141	101147	101148	101148	Tom	351	“ We 'd be delighted , "
101151	101161	101162	101162	Jennings	249	“ Lee and I will go get some lunch , ”
101165	101169	101162	101162	Jennings	249	“ Back shortly . ”
101170	101177	101178	101178	Tom	351	“ We 'll wait for you , ”
101181	101188	101178	101178	Tom	351	“ Thanks for bringing us here . ”
101189	101194	101162	101162	Jennings	249	“ Thank the Mayor . "
101195	101205	101206	101206	Wentworth	396	“ Keep kneading until you get a perfect consistency , ”
101213	101230	101231	101231	He	396	“ then begin to roll out the water . I 'll be back before the pressing . "
101295	101298	101299	101299	Tom	351	“ Mimeograph ! "
101318	101321	101323	101323	Wentworth	396	" Indeed , ”
101325	101378	101323	101323	Wentworth	396	“ We are a modest operation , as I said . Mimeographing is our principal form of printing here . 114 Kim Stanley Robinson Not the most elegant method , or the most long lasting , but the machines are reliable , and besides , they 're about all we 've got . ”
101379	101385	101386	101386	Tom	351	“ What about ditto masters ? "
101410	101448	101449	101449	He	396	“ We had a good supply of ditto masters , and we 've learned how to make more , using the mimeo ink and this paper . Still , it 's the weak link in our chain . ”
101469	101491	101449	101449	He	396	“ Because of that we have to conserve , by single spacing and small margins . Difficult to read , rather ugly- "
101492	101499	101500	101500	Tom	351	" I think it 's beautiful , ”
101511	101515	101500	101500	Tom	351	" It suffices . ”
101516	101523	101524	101524	I	0	“ Pretty color ink , too , ”
101552	101589	101590	101590	He	396	“ Ha ! Do you think so ? I would prefer black , myself , but we must work with what we have . Now over here is our true pride . A hand letter press . ”
101611	101618	101619	101619	Tom	351	" Is that what that is , ”
101632	101639	101619	101619	Tom	351	“ I 've never seen one . "
101640	101695	101696	101696	He	396	“ This is what we do our fine work on . But there is n't enough paper , and none of us knew , at first , how to set type . So it goes very slowly . We have had some successes , however . Following Gutenburg , here is our first one . ”
101711	101736	101696	101696	He	396	“ King James version , of course , although if I could have found a Jerusalem , it would have been a difficult choice . ”
101737	101740	101741	101741	Tom	351	“ Wonderful ! "
101748	101752	101741	101741	Tom	351	“ I mean — "
101782	101790	101763	101763	him	396	“ That 's a lot of typesetting . ”
101791	101794	101795	101795	Wentworth	396	“ Ha ! "
101803	101828	101795	101795	Wentworth	396	“ Indeed . And all for the sake of a book we already have . That 's not really the point , is it . "
101829	101835	101763	101763	him	396	“ You print new books ? ”
101836	101871	101872	101872	He	396	“ That occupies at least half our time , and is the part I 'm most interested in , I confess . We publish instruction manuals , almanacs , travel journals , reminiscences . ... "
101887	101932	101872	101872	He	396	“ As THE WILD SHORE 115 a matter of fact , we invite all survivors of the war to write their story down and submit it to us . We 're almost certain to print it up . As our contribution to historical record . ”
101942	101949	101950	101950	I	0	" You ought to do it , "
101954	101973	101950	101950	I	0	“ You 'd be perfect for it , all those stories you 've got about the old time . "
101974	101980	101982	101982	Wentworth	396	“ Ah , a storyteller ? ”
101984	102006	101982	101982	Wentworth	396	“ Then indeed you should . My feeling is , the more accounts we have of that period , the better . ”
102007	102012	102013	102013	Tom	351	" No thank you , ”
102056	102061	102062	102062	Wentworth	396	" Consider it further , ”
102065	102100	102062	102062	Wentworth	396	“ I think I could guarantee the readership of most of the San Diego residents . The literate residents , I mean to say . And since the Salton Sea people have contacted us — "
102101	102106	102107	102107	Tom	351	“ They contacted you ? ”
102110	102179	102107	102107	Tom	351	“ Yes . Two years ago a party arrived , and since then your guides Lee and Jennings , very industrious men , have supervised the reconstruction of a rail line out there . We 've shipped books to them , and they tell us they 've sent them even farther east . So distribution of your work , though uncertain , could very well span the continent . "
102180	102189	102190	102190	Wentworth	396	“ You agree that communication extends that far ? ”
102193	102257	102190	102190	Wentworth	396	“ We see through a glass darkly , as you know . I have in my possession a book printed in Boston , rather well done . Beyond that , I can not say . I have no reason to disbelieve their claims . In any case , a book by you might just as easily reach Boston as that book reached me . ”
102258	102265	102266	102266	Tom	351	" I 'll think about it , "
102284	102290	102291	102291	I	0	“ Do it , Tom , "
102302	102312	102313	102313	Wentworth	396	" Come see what we have printed so far , ”
102367	102371	102373	102373	Wentworth	396	" Our library , ”
102375	102383	102384	102384	he	396	“ Not a lending library , unfortunately , ”
102402	102411	102412	102412	Tom	351	“ This case contains the works printed here . "
102464	102481	102482	102482	Tom	351	“ Practical Uses of the Timing Device From Westinghouse Washer - Dryers , by Bill Dangerfield , "

102506	102517	102501	102501	Wentworth	396	“ Would you like to see our gallery of illustrations ? ”
102596	102619	102620	102620	I	0	" These are the originals of illustrations for a book describing all the animals seen in the back country of San Diego . "
102649	102729	102620	102620	I	0	“ There were very extensive zoos in San Diego before the war . We assume that all the animals in the main zoo were killed in the downtown blast , but there was an annex to the zoo in the hills , and those animals escaped , or were freed . Those who survived the subsequent climatic changes — I suppose some were actually helped- have prospered . I myself have seen bears and wildebeest , baboons and reindeer . ”
102730	102737	102738	102738	I	0	" I like the tiger here , "
102766	102788	102789	102789	He	351	" I did that one myself , thanks . That was quite an encounter . Shall I tell you about it ? ”
102805	102808	102789	102789	He	351	" Sure . ”
102820	102887	102789	102789	He	351	“ We were on a trek beyond Mount Laguna . Do you know Mount Laguna ? It is a considerable peak twenty miles inland , and the snowpack lies heavy on it nearly all the year round . In the spring the streams in the surrounding hills gush with the THE WILD SHORE 117 melt , and in their steeper sections they can be quite impassable . “
103028	103135	103017	103017	Cuyamucans	401	" As nightfall approached I struck out ahead of my party , to scout possible camps , for our slow progress meant we would be spending the night in Indian territory . I found nothing very suitable for night defense , and as it was getting near sundown I retraced my path . When I got to the small clearing where I had left my friends , however , they were not there . Their tracks were confusing , but seemed to lead north , and over the sounds of the rushing streams in the area I imagined I heard gunfire in that direction as well . “
103228	103229	103218	103218	They	3166	” “
103234	103238	103218	103218	They	3166	" I asked . "

103287	103291	103283	103283	You	0	” I exclaimed . “
103339	103435	103469	103469	he	3170	“ He appeared from the clump so suddenly that at first I was merely appalled at the catastrophic proportions my bad luck had reached . I was sure I was living out the last moments of 118 Kim Stanley Robinson my existence , and yet I could not move , or even take my eyes from the unblinking gaze of that beautiful but most deadly beast . I have no notion of exactly how long we stood there staring at each other . I know it was one of the central minutes of my life . "
103677	103812	103828	103828	He	351	“ Much later the moon rose , and still we walked through the forest together . Then I heard gunshots ahead , and the beast 's purring stopped , its shoulder muscles tensed . In a clearing illumined by moonlight I made out several horses , and around them men - Indians , I guessed , for my party had no horses with it . More gunshots sounded from trees on the other side of the clearing , and I surmised that my friends were there , for just as we had no horses , the Cuyamuca Indians had no guns . The tiger shrugged off my hand with a twitch of his fur , a twitch that no doubt usually removed flies , and strode ahead of me , down toward the clearing . ”
103813	103816	103817	103817	Tom	351	“ Hey ! "
103851	103858	103859	103859	Wentworth	396	“ Which one have you found ? ”

103953	103972	103980	103980	Tom	351	“ But is it true ? An American went around the world and returned just eight years ago ? ”
104037	104063	104031	104031	Wentworth	396	“ Glen sailed to Catalina in 2030 , that is certain . And he reappeared in San Diego one night in the fall of 2039 . "
104087	104096	104082	104082	Tom	351	“ The rest you have between those covers . ”
104097	104111	104112	104112	Tom	351	" I had no idea this kind of stuff was still being written , ”
104115	104119	104112	104112	Tom	351	“ How wonderful . "
104120	104128	104082	104082	Tom	351	“ It is , is n't it . "

104138	104179	104180	104180	He	396	“ He took off for the Salton Sea last fall . Before he left he told me the title of his next book : Overland to Boston . I expect it will be as interesting as the one you hold . ”

104241	104269	104270	104270	He	396	“ We have a lot of copies of that book . Take one with you back to San Onofre , courtesy of the New Green Tiger Press . "
104285	104302	104282	104282	Tom	351	“ Thank you sir , thank you very much . This means a lot to me . "

104440	104456	104457	104457	He	396	“ Here is a blank book , in case you decide to write that memoir . ”
104472	104491	104457	104457	He	396	“ Give it back to us full , and we will set about the task of reproducing it . ”
104492	104499	104501	104501	Tom	351	“ Oh , I could n't , "
104503	104511	104501	104501	Tom	351	“ You 've given us enough already . ”

106848	106865	106866	106866	he	5274	“ I 've been to look , and the rails where those bombs hit are melted , ”
106932	106952	106953	106953	He	5274	“ Puddles of iron ! And the dirt around it like black brick . Trees burnt to a crisp . "
106967	107000	106953	106953	He	5274	“ You men must have left some sign that you were working on those tracks , something that could be seen in the satellite pictures . I hold you responsible for that . ”
107064	107159	107051	107051	Jennings	249	“ Most of that line goes through forest , Mayor , and it 's under trees so it ca n't be seen from above . You saw that . In the open patches we did n't touch a thing , even if we had to work the cars through brush . And the bridges look exactly like they did before . Not a thing had been changed except the track , and we had to change that to make it passable . There was nothing that could be seen from above , I swear . ”
107190	107193	107194	107194	he	249	“ Spies , "
107197	107216	107217	107217	He	249	“ Someone in Onofre must have told the scavengers in Orange County , and they told the Japs . ”

107382	107389	107390	107390	Jennings	249	“ Melted track will be hard , ”

107512	107537	107489	107489	Jennings	249	“ Lee , I wish you 'd talk back to him sometimes . He just gets madder when you do n't answer like that . ”

108021	108105	108132	108133	the speaker	3323	“ Maybe . But we 've got anchorages up the coast , and Thompson has done this a thousand times . In fact it should be easier than usual , with no Jap landing parties to intercept . You 'll be home almost as fast as if we 'd gone by train . Well not really , but once we had a strong wind from the south on 128 Kim Stanley Robinson the way up , and from the north on the way — ”

109155	109177	109152	109154	Kim Stanley Robinson	341	" Yeah . He says the sound changes when we pass a rivermouth , and Thompson knows which rivermouth is which . ”
109178	109194	109152	109154	Kim Stanley Robinson	341	“ He must come up this way a lot to be able to do that . "

109199	109217	109152	109154	Kim Stanley Robinson	341	“ Let 's hope he does n't lose track and run us onto the Pulgas River delta . "

109414	109455	109407	109407	Thompson	407	“ Damned hard to do with this fog , and the wind dying down . And the swell is picking up , whoah , see what I mean ? These 'll make pretty damn big waves , I 'd say . "

Offshore here would be a plain tilted away from us , cut by canyons so deep we would n't be able to see the bottom of them . Then the plain would drop away so steeply we would n't be able to see the lowlands beyond . That 's the continental shelf I 've told you about .

120252	120264	120249	120249	Jennings	249	“ You should have seen him moaning . He sounded terrible . ”
120265	120311	120212	120212	Tom	351	" I felt terrible , I mean to tell you . But now I feel just fine . You have no idea how glad I am to see you , boy ! I have n't been this happy in as long as I can remember . ”
120313	120323	120324	120324	Jennings	249	“ Too bad we missed you in the dark , ”
120327	120358	120324	120324	Jennings	249	“ You 152 Kim Stanley Robinson could have rowed in with the rest of us and saved a lot of trouble , I bet . We had lots of room . "

120434	120439	120390	120390	I	0	" And swam in ? ”
120440	120443	120392	120392	them	3642	“ Yes . "
120444	120456	120392	120392	them	3642	“ Whoah ! Did you see the dinghy on the beach ? ”
120457	120470	120471	120471	I	0	“ How did you get in with the swell breaking so high ? ”
120478	120502	120503	120503	I	0	“ Swam in . Saw the boat on the beach , and rested under it . I figured you must be up here . "
120510	120519	120520	120520	Jennings	249	“ How 'd you get the boat in ? ”
120526	120601	120520	120520	Jennings	249	“ When the sloop went down we all stepped in the dinghy , all except Lee who fell overboard . So we did n't even get wet . We rowed off a ways and pulled Lee out of the drink and waited for you . But we could n't find you , and Thompson said he saw you go down under the mast . So we figured you 'd drowned , and rowed ashore . "
120602	120611	120612	120612	I	0	“ How 'd you get the boat in ? "
120616	120713	120612	120612	I	0	" Well , that was Thompson 's doing . With all of us in that little boat we had about an inch clearance , so when he found where that little creek was pouring out and breaking the swell a bit , he booted Lee and me overboard , and we had to swim in . That was something , I tell you — although I guess you 'd know . Anyway they caught one of the smaller waves and rode it right onto the beach . A nicer piece of seamanship you 'll never see . ”
120717	120727	120714	120714	Thompson	407	“ Lucky we caught that wave right , actually . ”
120728	120763	120769	120769	I	0	" So except for Lee , and me at the end there , we did n't even get wet ! But you , boy . That must have been one hell of a swim . "
120764	120768	120769	120769	I	0	“ Long way , ”
121239	121249	121236	121236	I	0	“ Did you save those books Wentworth gave you ? ”
121250	121259	121236	121236	I	0	“ Yes . They never even got wet . ”
121260	121263	121236	121236	I	0	“ Good . ”
121398	121404	121393	121393	Tom	289	“ We 'll head home . ”
121882	121890	121891	121891	he	341	“ We might as well get going , "
121894	121926	121891	121891	he	341	“ Weather is n't going to get any better for a good while , I do n't believe . And I do n't want to spend another day waiting it out . "
121945	121985	121940	121940	Jennings	249	“ When we get to Ten Post River there 's a box of food and clothing . We can put up a shelter like this one here if we need to , and we 'll have some food . ' “
121992	121996	121940	121940	Jennings	249	” Thompson asked . “

122032	122077	122021	122022	these two	1182	" Thompson agreed to the plan , and without further ado we got ready to leave . Jennings laughed at my woeful face and gave me his underpants , thick white things that hung past my heels , and were still a trifle damp . “

122133	122212	122213	122213	We	3671	" Tom said , looking up at the flying snow . We hiked up the ravine until it was only a dip in the plain of the forest , and then stopped . Water dripped from the branches around us , and the wind swirled . Fearfully I felt the cold climb past my numb bare feet and up my legs ; I 'd had enough of that . We said a hasty farewell to the San Diegans . "
122228	122233	122222	122222	I	0	” Jennings told me . “
122244	122302	122235	122236	the Mayor	5274	” Lee said to Tom . We promised to be ready for them , and after some awkward shuffling of the feet they were off through the trees . Tom and I turned and walked north . Soon we came upon the torn remains of a narrow asphalt road , and Tom declared we should follow it . “
122312	122313	122235	122236	the Mayor	5274	" "

122415	122522	122523	122523	Tom	289	" The road was just patches of asphalt on the forest floor , broken pretty regularly by little ravines . We made slow going of it , and soon I could n't feel my feet at all . Walking seemed exceptionally hard work . Tom kept on my windward side , and occasionally held me up with his right arm . I lost track of our surroundings until we came to a long stretch of treeless land , covered with waist - high brush that flailed in the wind . Here we could see far out to sea , and the wind struck us full force . “
122529	122530	122523	122523	Tom	289	” “
122551	122580	122710	122710	your	284	” But when we got there we found that the opposite side of it was smashed , and the roof was gone . It was filling with slush . “
122583	122587	122710	122710	your	284	” said Tom . “
122594	122606	122710	122710	your	284	” On we went . I could n't seem to shiver . “
122610	122614	122710	122710	your	284	" I muttered . “
122622	122693	122710	122710	your	284	” The cold : I know I 've mentioned it many times here . But not enough to indicate its power , its deadly influence the way it hurts even when you 're numb , and the way that the pain saps your strength , and the way that a part of your mind stays awake , scared to death that other parts are as asleep as your fingers . ... “
122696	122697	122694	122694	Henry	284	” “
122701	122702	122710	122710	your	284	” “
122726	122760	122718	122718	your	284	" He held me up , and we stumbled toward the next little block pile — the only building from the old time I had ever seen that was smaller than my home . “
122765	122770	122771	122771	We	3685	” Tom assured me . “
122824	122871	122818	122818	We	3685	” The shrubs bounced against the ground again and again , and upslope the trees howled . Snow obscured the view to sea , it kept striking me in the eyes . We reached the block building , and Tom looked in the open doorway warily . “
122875	122883	122818	122818	We	3685	” he THE WILD SHORE 157 said . “
122896	123171	122818	122818	We	3685	" He pulled me inside , helped me sit down against one block wall . The doorway was on the inland side , so the wind shelter was complete . That in itself was a blessing . But in the corner across from me was a big pile of branches , wood long dead and perfectly dry . Tom leaped to the pile with cries of selfcongratulation , and began shifting it into the doorway . When he had it all arranged to his satisfaction he dug around in his shoulder bag and pulled out a lighter . He snapped it ; as if he had said a magic spell a tall flame stood off the end of it . Behind the little orange flame his face gleamed , a grin splitting it in two , showing his half - dozen remaining teeth . Water dripped down his pate into the complicated delta system of his wrinkles , his beard and hair were tangled , and his eyes were wide open so that the whites showed over the iris . His hand shook , and he laughed like an animal . He flicked the flame off and on twice , then crouched down and applied it to the smaller branches and twigs at the bottom of his pile . In hardly any time at all the whole pile was blazing . The air in the little room cooked . I held my feet in my hands , and shifted across the floor to put them closer to the flames . Tom saw me move on my own and he hopped around the fire cheerfully . “
123244	123281	123301	123301	you	5376	” From inside our tiny fortress the waterfall roar of the wind was loud . I got warm enough to start shivering again , and my feet pricked and burned . Tom put more wood on . “
123305	123306	123301	123301	you	5376	” "
123309	123400	123301	123301	you	5376	" I thought I did understand him , but this was n't it for me . It was treading water at night outside a giant swell breakingnot knowing whether there are rocks between you and the shore . I 'd had my fill of its , at least temporarily and maybe for good . I wanted nothing more to do with them . We got warm enough to take off our clothes and scorch a little water out of them . Then Tom urged me to get ready to leave . "
123414	123498	123301	123301	you	5376	" I was ravenous so I agreed with him , though I was unhappy to leave our shelter . In what sounded like a lull in the wind we left our 158 Kim Stanley Robinson blockhouse and hurried along the asphalt road . The wind instantly cooled our clothes back down , as I knew it would , and I could feel how wet my coat and pants were . The clouds galloped overhead , but for the moment the snow had stopped . "
123503	123535	123301	123301	you	5376	" Tom muttered with a curse . He took the windward side again and matched me step for step . Both of us had our faces turned away from the wind . “
123649	123664	123645	123645	Henry	284	” On and on he puffed with his nonsense , trying to distract me . “
123734	123825	123732	123732	myself	0	" and so on , until the cold got to him too , and he put his head down and his arm around my waist and we trudged it out . It seemed to go on forever . Once I glanced up , and saw the sea as green as the forest , gray clouds massed over it , whitecaps breaking out everywhere on its surface , so that it was almost as white as it was green . Then I put my head down again . Finally Tom said , “
123840	123841	123834	123834	We	3700	” “
123844	123923	123834	123834	We	3700	” Then we were back among trees , and crossing that ridge . Past Concrete Bay and up to the freeway . It was snowing again and we could hardly see any distance at all . Trees appeared like ghosts out of the falling slush . I wanted to hurry but my feet were gone again and I kept stumbling on things . If it were n't for the old man I would have fallen a dozen times . “
123931	123935	123834	123834	We	3700	" I said . “
123942	123943	123834	123834	We	3700	” "
123955	124041	123946	123947	Your pa	5291	" Even the valley seemed to stretch out , and it took hard walking to cross it . We weaved past the big eucalypus at the corner , up to my door . I 've never been happier to see that shack in my life . White slush slid down the roof as we pounded the THE WILD SHORE 159 door and burst in like long lost voyagers . Pa had been asleep . Looking surprised he gave me a hug , tugged his moustache . "
124046	124050	123946	123947	Your pa	5291	” he said . “
124057	124114	123946	123947	Your pa	5291	” Tom and I laughed ; we began to talk . I put my feet right on the stove and felt the skin scorch . Tom was talking fast as Jennings , and laughing every other sentence . I ransacked the shelves and threw Tom a half loaf of bread , saving a chunk for myself . “
124119	124173	123946	123947	Your pa	5291	” Tom inquired , mouth full . Pa got out some jerky for us , and we wolfed it down . We ate every scrap of food in the place , and stoked up the fire in the stove higher than it had been since my ma died . Talking all the while . “
124186	124191	124179	124179	I	0	” Tom was saying . “
124198	124258	124192	124192	He	3705	” Pa 's eyes were wide . I took out the wash bucket and washed myself with a rag , getting all the sand out of my crotch and armpits . My feet burned something fierce . We both kept telling Pa our story , confusing him no end . Finally we both shut up at the same time . “
124266	124270	124261	124261	you	3704	” Pa said . “
124273	124301	124261	124261	you	3704	” Tom said , and cackled loudly , almost hysterical with relief . He jammed a last chunk of bread in his mouth , nodded , swallowed . “
124306	124397	124261	124261	you	3704	" Part Three THE WORLD Chapter Eleven After Tom went home I slept like a dead man for the rest of the day and all that night . When I woke up the next morning I was annoyed to see that the storm was over . The sun streamed in the door like it had never left . Why , if we had held on one more day in our shelter , we could have waltzed home easy as you please ! Pa heard me moan and he stopped sewing . “
124407	124408	124261	124261	you	3704	" “
124422	125316	124416	124416	I	0	” Actually my arms were blocks of wood , and my legs scissors , and I was unhappy to discover a host of scratches and scrapes and bruises that hurt practically every time I breathed . But I had an urge to get out and look around , so I got off the bed with more groans . When I got outside and started down the path ( buckets jerking my poor arms every step ) the sunlight stung my eyes . There were still some clouds but mostly it was sunny , everything steaming . The Costas ' drum house looked like it was on fire it was steaming so . I creaked down the path staring and staring . 163 164 Kim Stanley Robinson Have I described the valley yet ? It is in the shape of a cupped hand , and filled with trees . Down in the crease of the palm is the river winding to the sea , and the fields of corn and barley and potatoes . The heel of the hand is Basilone Hill , and up there is the Costas ' place , and Addison 's tower , and Rafael 's rambling house and workshop . Across from that , the spiny forested fingers of Tom 's ridge . All of the oldest houses were eccentric , I noticed ; I had never thought of it that way before , but it was so . Rafael kept adding rooms to store machinery and things , and they followed the contour of the hillside , so that in time , if you were to try and draw a plan of it , it would look like an X written on top of a W. Doc Costa had made his house of oil drums , as I 've said , to hold in the heat in the winter and the cool in the summer . Probably he had n't counted on the house whistling like a banshee in the least little breeze ; he said it did n't bother him any , but I thought it might be the reason Mando scared so easily . The Nicolins had their big old time house on the beach cliff , and the Eggloffs had their home burrowed back into the hillside where thumb and finger would meet , if you were still thinking of the valley as a cupped hand ; they lived like weasels in there , and by the graveyard too , but they claimed to have Doc all beat as far as warmth in the winter and cool in the summer were concerned . And then there was Tom , up on his ridge where he was bound to get frozen by storms and baked by the sun , but did he care ? Not him - he wanted to see . So did Addison Shanks , apparently , set up on Basilone Hill in a house built around an old electric tower ; but maybe he was there because it was nice and close to San Clemente , where he could conduct his dealings with no one the wiser . The newer houses , now , were all down in the valley next to the fields , convenient to the river , and everybody had helped build them , so that they looked pretty much the same : square boxes , steel struts at the corners , old wood for walls , wood or sheet metal , maybe tiles , for a roof . The same design twice as long and you had the bathhouse . When I got to the river I sat gingerly and continued to look around at it all . I could n't get enough of it . It all looked so familiar and yet so strange . Before my trip south Onofre was just home , a natural place , and the houses , the bridge and the paths , the fields and the latrines , they were all just as much a part of it as the cliffs and the river and the trees . But now I THE WILD SHORE 165 saw it all in a new way . The path . A broad swath of dusty dirt cutting through the weeds , curving here to get around the corner of the Simpsons ' garden , narrowing there where rocks cramped it on both sides .... It went where it did because there had been agreement , when folks first moved to the valley , that this was the best way to the river from the meadows to the south . People 's thinking made that path . I looked at the bridgerough planks on steel struts , spanning the gap between the stone bases on each bank . People I knew had thought that bridge , and built it . And the same was true of every structure in the valley . I tried to look at the bridge in the old way , as part of things as they were , but it did n't work . When you 've changed you ca n't go back . Nothing looks the same ever again . Walking back from the river , arms aching with the weight of the full buckets , I was grabbed roughly from behind . "

125387	125391	125381	125381	you	5307	" Steve said . “
125396	125487	125392	125392	You	5307	” I nodded and told him about the train ride south , and the Mayor 's dinner . Nicolin squinted as he imagined the Mayor 's island house , but I thought , he 's not getting it right . There was nothing I could do about it by talking , either . When I told him about the trip home , my swim and all , he put his bucket down in Pa 's garden and took me by the shoulders to shake me , laughing at the clouds . “
125504	125505	125499	125499	Henry	284	" “
125509	125536	125499	125499	Henry	284	” I said , rubbing my arm as he danced around the bucket . But I was pleased . He stopped dancing and pursed his lips . “
125546	125550	125538	125539	these Japanese	3708	” I nodded . "

125583	125637	125573	125573	Tom	351	" There were snails on the cabbage , and I stooped carefully to knock them off . Down close I could see the damage pests had done to every head . Miserable cabbage it was , and I sighed , thinking of the salads at the Mayor 's dinner . 166 Kim Stanley Robinson “
125648	125655	125638	125638	I	0	" Nicolin said , staring north . “
125681	125690	125677	125679	the American resistance	7010	" He swung a fist at the sky . “
125697	125741	125677	125679	the American resistance	7010	” The idea took him into regions of his own , and he wandered the garden insensible to me . I yanked some weeds and inspected the rest of the cabbages . Gave it up as a bad job . Casually Steve said , “
125747	125748	125749	125749	I	0	" "
125776	125777	125766	125766	I	0	" "
125789	125793	125780	125780	I	0	” Steve frowned . “
125802	126325	125799	125800	this Mayor	3715	" So we passed some time talking about the trip , and Pa joined us in the garden to listen . Soon Steve had to leave , and I spent the rest of the day napping or stretching around in the garden , trying to loosen up . Again I slept the night without stirring . The next morning Steve dropped by to walk with me down to the rivermouth . The men there stopped launching the boats long enough to greet me and ask some questions . When John walked by we all shut up and looked busy until he passed . Eventually we got the boats off , and getting them outside the swell took all our attention . The men were impressed that I 'd managed to swim in through such a swell at night , and to tell the truth so was I. In fact I was scared all over again , though I tried not to show it . Far to the south I could see the long curving lines of the swell sweep toward the land , crash over , tumble whitely to shore . For a display of raw power there was nothing to match it . I was lucky to be alive , damned lucky ! I gulped my heart back down to where it belonged , clenched my hands to stop them shaking . Rafael wanted to hear everything he could about the Japanese , so all the time we were getting the nets out I talked , and he questioned me , and I had a good time . John rowed by and ordered Steve to get out and do the rod fishing- told me to stay with the nets . Steve got in the dinghy and rowed off south , with a resentful glance over his shoulder at us . And then it was fishing again . The boats tossed hard in the swell , the spray gleamed in the sun , the green hills bounced to the horizons north and south . We cast the nets ( my arms complaining with every pull or throw ) , and rowed them into circles and drew them up again heavy with fish . I rowed , pulled THE WILD SHORE 167 on nets , whacked fish , caught my balance on the gunwale , talked , kneaded my arms , and , looking up once at the familiar sight of the valley from the sea , I figured my adventure had ended . Despite all I was sorry about that . When the fishing was done and the boats on the flat , Steve and I found the whole gang waiting for us on the top of the cliff . Kathryn hugged me and Del and Gabby and Mando slapped my sore back , and oohed and aahed over my cuts and bruises . Kristen and Rebel joined us from the bread ovens , and they all demanded that I tell my story to them . So I sat and began to tell it , excitement filling my voice with creaks and long “

But it was also the third time that Nicolin had heard it , and I could tell by the tightness in the corner of his mouth , and the way he looked off into the trees , that he was getting tired of it . He recognized all my phrases , and it slowed me down . I found new ways to describe what had happened , but that did n't make much difference . I found myself passing over events as fast as I could , and Gab and Del jumped in to pepper me with questions about the details . I answered the questions , and I could see that Nicolin was listening , but he kept looking into the trees . Even though I was just telling the facts I began to feel like I was bragging . Kathryn braided her disobedient hair and encouraged me with an exclamation here and there ; she saw what was going on , and I caught her giving Steve a hard look . We got back on the subject of San Diego , and I told them about La Jolla , thinking that Nicolin had n't yet heard about that part of the trip . I described the ruined school , and the place where they printed books , and sure enough Nicolin 's mouth relaxed and he looked at me . “

I went on with my story , but even though Steve had been putting a crimp in my style , it suddenly was n't as much fun . It was near sunset when I finished . Gabby and Del took off . Mando and Kristen followed ; at the freeway Mando sidled up to Kristen and took her hand . I raised my eyebrows , and seeing it Kathryn laughed . “

129894	129912	129891	129891	Rebel	295	“ But it 's hard to be pregnant all that time and nothing to show for it . ”
129913	129919	129920	129920	Carmen	334	“ They were bad ones , ”
129923	129927	129920	129920	Carmen	334	“ Real bad . ”

129956	130030	129953	129953	Carmen	334	“ It was radiation that did that , and I 'm sure God does n't approve . Those that are born bad , it 's a blessing to them to send them back to God and let Him try with them again . If we let them live they 'd be a burden on themselves as much as on us . I ca n't see how you do n't see that , Reb . "

130133	130144	130145	130145	Kathryn	293	“ It was yeast brought bread back , not me , ”

130770	130776	130777	130777	they	3847	” Kathryn said to me , "

130814	130834	130789	130789	You	0	” said Steve . He was tired of hearing about my adventure , that was sure . Mando added , “
130837	130864	130789	130789	You	0	" Mando was desperate to hear the story ; he really loved it . Steve nodded approvingly and started again . Her shears snipped the air . "
130873	131055	130789	130789	You	0	" She wrinkled her nose as I passed her , and beslimed and bewhiskered as I was I could hardly blame her ; I felt like a barbarian . Inside their tile - walled bathing room I washed under a shower that provided water from freezing to boiling , depending on the bather 's desire . Mrs. Nisha ( for such , I found , was their family name ) brought me some clothes and showed me how to use a buzzing shaver . When all was done I stood before a perfect mirror in gray pants and a bright blue shirt , a cosmopolitan . When he arrived home Hadaka 's father was less upset by my presence than his wife had been . Mr. Nisha looked me up and down and shook my hand , invited me in harsh English to sit with the family . He was Japanese , as I may not have said , and he looked much like Hadaka , although his skin was dark . He was a good deal shorter than Mrs. Nisha . "
131061	131074	131075	131075	I	0	" he said after Hadaka told him the story of my arrival .. "
131093	131094	131075	131075	I	0	" "
131100	131920	131075	131075	I	0	" . He asked a hundred questions , and after that a hundred more . I told him everything about me , including my plans . It seemed I had been even luckier than 1 yet knew , having Hadaka intercept me , for Mr. Nisha was a worker in the Japanese government of the Channel Islands , in the department supervising the Americans living there . In this THE WILD SHORE 177 work he had met Mrs. Nisha , who had crossed the channel as I had some twenty years before . Mr , Nisha also had a hand in a dozen other activities at least , and most of them were illegal , although it took me a week or two to realize this fully . But from that very night I saw that he was quite an entrepreneur , and I took pains to let him know I would serve him in any way I could . When he was done questioning me all three of them showed me to a cot in their garden shed , and I retired in good spirits . Within the week I had papers proving I had been bom on Catalina and had spent my life there , serving the Japanese . After that I could leave the Nishas ' house freely , and Mr. Nisha put me to work fishing with Hadaka and weeding their garden . Later , after this trial period was done , he had me exchange heavy brown packages with strangers on the streets of Avalon , or escort Japanese from the airport on the backside of the island into town , without of course subjecting them to the inconveniences of the various checkpoints . It should not be imagined that these and the other clandestine activities Mr. Nisha assigned to me were at all unusual in Avalon . It was a town teeming with representatives of every race and creed and nation , and as the United Nations had declared that the island was to be used by the Japanese only , and only for the purpose of quarantining the American coast , it was obvious that many visitors were there illegally . But officials like Mr. Nisha existed in great numbers , at all levels , both on Catalina and in the Hawaiian Islands , which served as the entry point to western America . Almost everyone in town had papers authorizing their presence , and it was impossible to tell whose were forged or bought ; but wandering the streets I saw people dressed in all manner of clothing , with features Oriental , or Mexican , or with skin as black as the night sky ; and I knew something was amiss in the Japanese administration . I was happy to try conversing with any or all of these foreigners , employing my few words of Japanese , and listening to some peculiar versions of English . The only persons I was wary of talking to were those who looked American , and I noticed that they were not anxious to talk with me either . Chances were too good that they were refugees as I was , employed in some desperate enterprise to stay in 178 Kim Stanley Robinson Avalon ; it was rumored that quite a few worked for the police . In the face of such dangers it seemed best to ignore any fellow feeling . The old part of Avalon stood much as it had in the old time , I was told : small whitewashed houses covering the hillsides that fell into the little bay that served as the harbor . Jetties had been built to enlarge the harbor , and new construction spilled over the hills to the north and west , hundreds of buildings in the Japanese style , with thick beams and thin walls , and peaky tile roofs . The whole of the island had new concrete roads , lined with low stone walls that divided the grounds of parklike estates , on which were giant mansions that the Japanese called dachas . Here officials of the U.N. and the Japanese administration made their homes . The dachas on the west side of the island were smaller ; the really big ones faced the mainland , as the view of America was greatly prized . The biggest dachas of all , I heard , were on the east side of San Clemente Island , it was their lights I had seen on the night I decided to circumnavigate the globe . A few weeks passed . I travelled in a car over the white roads , drove once and nearly crashed into a wall ; when one drives there is a gale created merely by one 's passage over the road , and everything moves a bit too fast for the reflexes . “
131936	131943	131925	131925	you	3850	” Rebel interrupted to ask me . “
131948	131952	131925	131925	you	3850	” I said . “
131985	131986	131965	131965	I	0	" “
131989	132678	132682	132682	they	3854	" Mando exclaimed , and Steve nodded and went on , too absorbed in the story to even look up from the page . I saw the giant flying machines , jets , land at the airport like pelicans , and take off with roars that almost burst the ears . And all the while I pursued various tasks for the gain of Mr. Nisha . When I had fully obtained his trust , he asked me if I would guide a night expedition to San Diego , consisting of five Japanese businessmen who were visiting Ca . talina expressly for that purpose . I was extremely reluctant to return to the mainland , but Mr. Nisha proposed to split the fee he charged for such a trip with me , and it was THE WILD SHORE 179 enormous . I weighed the advantages , and agreed to it . So one night I found myself motorboating back to San Diego , giving instructions to the pilot , Ao , the only other person aboard who spoke English . Ao knew where the coast patrol ships were to be that night , and assured me there would be no interference from them . I directed him to a landing site on the inside of Point Loma , took them up to the ruins of the little lighthouse , and walked them through the lined - up white crosses of the naval cemetery - a cemetery so vast it might have been thought to hold all of the dead from the great devastation . At dawn we hid in one of the abandoned houses , and all that day the five businessmen clicked their huge cameras at the spiky downtown skyline , and the blasted harbor . That night we returned to Avalon , and I felt reasonably happy about it all . I led four more expeditions to San Diego after that , and they were all simple and lucrative but for the last , in which I was convinced against my better judgement to lead the boat up the mouth of the Mission River at night . My readers in San Diego will know that the mouth of the Mission is congested with debris , runs over an old pair of jetties and a road or two , changes every spring , and is in general one of the most turbulent , weird , and dangerous rivermouths anywhere . Now on this night the ocean was as flat as a table , but it had rained hard the day before , and the runoff swirled over the concrete blocks in the rivermouth as over waterfalls . One of our customers fell overboard under the weight of his camera ( they have cameras that photograph at night ) , and I dove in after him . It took a lot of effort from myself and Ao to reunite us all , and escape to sea . In a sailboat we would have drowned ; and I was used to sail . boats . After that I was not so pleased with the notion of guiding further expeditions . And I had accumulated , through Mr. Nisha 's generosity , a good quantity of money . Two nights after the disaster trip , there was a big party at one of the plush dachas high on the east flank of the island , and the man whose life I had saved offered , in his dozen words of English , to hire me as a servant and take me with him to Japan . Apparently Ao had told him of my aspiration to travel , and he hoped to repay me for saving his life . I took Hadaka out into the shaped shrubbery of the 180 Kim Stanley Robinson garden , and we sat over a lighted fountain that gurgled onto the terrace below . We looked at the dark bulk of the continent , and I told her of my opportunity . With a sisterly kiss ( we had shared kisses of a different nature once or twice “
132685	132701	132682	132682	they	3854	” Rebel crowed , and the girls laughed . Kathryn imitated Steve 's reading voice : “
132723	132724	132682	132682	they	3854	" “
132728	132739	132682	132682	they	3854	" Steve shouted , but we were in stitches now . “
132748	132782	132740	132740	I	0	” He read , ( we had shared kisses of a different nature once or twice , but I did not feel an attraction strong enough to risk Mr. Nisha 's anger ) . “
132787	132791	132785	132785	coward	3858	” Kristen cried . “
132796	132797	132785	132785	coward	3858	” “
132803	132807	132808	132809	This guy	5348	” said Steve . “
132855	132856	132850	132850	I	0	" “
132859	132864	132850	132850	I	0	” Mando begged them . “
133106	133112	133113	133113	Steve	351	“ That 's Chapter Two , ”
133120	133127	133113	133113	Steve	351	“ He 's on his way . ”
133128	133134	133135	133135	Mando	281	" Oh read some more , ”
133138	133142	133143	133143	He	351	“ Not now . "
133162	133173	133177	133177	he	351	“ It 's about time for supper , I guess . "
133186	133196	133197	133197	he	351	" These gals sure are hard on a story , ”
133200	133205	133206	133206	Kathryn	293	“ Oh come on , "
133209	133226	133206	133206	Kathryn	293	“ What 's the fun of reading it together if we ca n't talk about it ? "
133227	133235	133179	133179	his	351	“ You do n't take it seriously . "
133236	133251	133206	133206	Kathryn	293	“ What does that mean ? Maybe we do n't take it too seriously . ”
133252	133258	133259	133259	Steve	351	" I 'm off home , ”
133264	133270	133259	133259	Steve	351	“ You coming , Hank ? ”
133272	133289	133259	133259	Steve	351	“ I 'm going back to my place . I 'll see you in the morning . "
133290	133302	133303	133303	Carmen	334	" Tom wants a town meeting at the church tomorrow night , ”
133307	133312	133303	133303	Carmen	334	“ Did you know ? "
133335	133342	133343	133343	Steve	351	“ What 's the meeting about ? "
133346	133350	133352	133352	Carmen	334	“ San Diego , ”
133359	133374	133375	133375	I	0	“ Tom'll bring up the question of helping the San Diegans fight the Japanese , "
133378	133385	133375	133375	I	0	“ I told you about that . ”
133386	133392	133393	133393	Steve	351	" I 'll be there , "
133569	133584	133565	133565	he	351	“ I do n't know if it was worth the trouble dragging him here . ”
133715	133734	133735	133735	Steve	351	“ So I saw that the shark had his big mouth open and was about to swallow me , ”
133740	133789	133735	133735	Steve	351	“ and I stuck my oar between his jaws so he could n't bite me . But I had to hang on to the oar to keep from being sucked down whole , and I was running out of air too . I had to figure something out . ”
134205	134213	134200	134200	Marvin	349	“ So what 's this all about ? ”
134225	134229	134230	134230	Tom	351	“ All right , "
134491	134536	134484	134484	I	0	“ He lives in style , Henry , because he 's got a gang of men doing nothing but help him run things , that 's all . That 's what gives him the power to send men off east to contact other towns . "
134537	134541	134542	134542	I	0	“ Maybe so , "
134545	134555	134542	134542	I	0	“ But tell them what they found out east . "
134563	134605	134556	134556	Tom	351	“ He claims that his men have been as far as Utah , and that all the inland towns are banded together in a thing called the American resistance . The resistance , they say , wants to unify America again . "
134622	134625	134616	134617	John Nicolin	278	“ So ? ”
134626	134629	134630	134630	Tom	351	“ So , "
134633	134657	134658	134658	He	351	" he wants us to do our part in this great plan , by helping the San Diegans fight the Japanese on Catalina . ”
134669	134708	134658	134658	He	351	“ Now we know why dead Orientals have been washing onto our beach . But apparently they have n't stopped trying to land , and now the San Diegans want our help getting rid of them for good . ”
134709	134718	134720	134721	Mrs. Mariani	431	“ What exactly do they mean by help ? ”
134727	134730	134731	134731	Tom	351	“ Well ... "
134739	134755	134735	134735	Doc	287	“ It means they 'd want our rivermouth as an anchorage to base attacks from . ”
134771	134792	134760	134761	Recovery Simpson	328	“ It means we 'd finally have the guns and manpower to do something about being guarded like we are . ”
135183	135276	135179	135179	he	287	“ I remember once when Gabino Canyon folks were asked by the Cristianitos Canyon people to join them when they were fighting with Talega Canyon over the wells at the Four Canyon Flat . They did it , but when the fight was over there was n't any Gabino Canyon at the THE WILD SHORE 187 swap meet anymore . It was just Cristianitos . The thing is , bigger towns tend to eat up the littler ones around them . Henry will tell you there 's hundreds of people down there — "
135277	135290	135291	135291	Steve	351	“ But we 're not just the next canyon over from them , ”
135294	135327	135328	135328	He	351	“ There 's miles and miles between us and them . And we should be fighting the Japanese . Every town should be part of the resistance , otherwise it 's hopeless . ”
135358	135370	135371	135371	Doc	287	“ Miles are n't going to matter if the train works , "
135412	135425	135407	135407	Tom	351	" Hey ? Let 's go it one at a time now . ”
135432	135487	135426	135426	Rafael	292	“ We should fight the Japanese every chance we get . Face it , they 're hemming us in . We 're like fish in a big purse net . And they 're not only keeping us from the world , they 're keeping us from each other , by bombing tracks and bridges . "
135488	135501	135502	135502	Doc	287	“ We only have the San Diegans ' word for those attacks , "
135505	135516	135502	135502	Doc	287	“ How do we know they 're telling the truth ? ”
135517	135526	135527	135527	Mando	281	“ Of course they 're telling the truth , ”
135539	135550	135531	135531	He	281	“ Henry and Tom saw the bombs hit the tracks . ”
135551	135557	135558	135558	Doc	287	“ That may be so , "
135561	135604	135558	135558	Doc	287	“ But it does n't mean everything else they said is true . Could be they want us scared and looking for help . That Mayor of San Diego will start thinking he 's Mayor of Onofre the moment we join him . ”
135605	135614	135615	135615	Recovery	328	“ But what could he do to us ? ”
135636	135666	135667	135667	Doc	287	“ All it means is that we 'll be dealing with one more town , just like we deal with all the towns that come to the swap meet . "
135681	135717	135667	135667	Doc	287	“ Exactly not ! San Diego 's a lot bigger than us , and they do n't just want to trade . Like you said , Cov , they 've got a lot of guns . "
135718	135727	135728	135728	Cov	434	“ They ai n't going to shoot us , ”
135731	135740	135728	135728	Cov	434	“ Besides , they 're fifty miles away . "
135741	135747	135750	135750	Mendez	279	" I agree with Simpson , ”
135753	135811	135750	135750	Mendez	279	“ An alliance like this is part of knitting things up again . Those folks do n't 188 Kim Stanley Robinson want anything we have , and they could n't do anything to us if they did . They just want help in a fight that 's our fight too , whether we join it or not . ”
135812	135819	135820	135820	Rafael	292	“ That 's what I say , ”
135824	135845	135820	135820	Rafael	292	“ They 're holding us down , those Japanese ! We 've got to fight them just to stand up . "
135945	136077	136078	136078	He	351	“ We should be working . That 's what we should be doing . We should be gathering food and preserving it , building more shelter and improving what we got , getting more clothes and medicines from the meets . Getting more boats and gear , firewood , all of that . Making it all work . That 's your job , Rafe . Not trying to fight people out there who have a million times the power we do . That 's a dream . If we do anything in the way of fighting , it should be right here in this valley , and for this valley . Not for anybody else . Not for those clowns down south , and sure not for any idea like America . ”
136097	136180	136093	136093	he	351	" America 's gone . It 's dead . There 's us in this valley , and there 's others in San Diego , Orange , behind Pendleton , over on Catalina . But they 're not us . This valley is the biggest country we 're going to have in our lives , and it 's what we should be working for , keeping everyone in it alive and healthy . That 's what we should be doing , I say . ”
136222	136309	136217	136217	Rafael	292	“ Our valley is n't big enough to think that way , John . All the people we trade with depend on us , and we depend on them . We 're all countrymen . And we 're all being held down by the guards on Catalina . You ca n't deny that , and you got to agree that working for us in this valley means being free to develop when we can . The way it is , we do n't have that freedom . ”
136496	136509	136510	136510	he	351	“ We 're all Americans no matter what valley we come from , "
136514	136553	136510	136510	he	351	“ We ca n't help it and we ca n't deny it . We were beat in a war and we 're still paying for it in every way , but some day we 'll be free again . "
136567	136584	136585	136585	He	351	“ When we get there it 'll be because people fought every chance they could get . ”
136682	136689	136690	136690	he	351	“ What about you , Addison ? ”
136783	136795	136764	136764	he	430	“ I do n't care much one way or the other . "
136796	136799	136800	136801	old Mendez	279	“ Pinché ! ”
136804	136811	136800	136801	old Mendez	279	“ You must have some opinion . ”
136812	136815	136817	136817	Add	430	" No , "
136819	136824	136817	136817	Add	430	“ I do n't . ”
136825	136831	136833	136833	Mendez	279	" That helps a lot , ”
136851	136864	136865	136865	Marvin	349	“ Yeah , Add , what did you come for , anyway ? ”
136872	136877	136885	136885	his	5316	" Wait a minute . ”
136888	136910	136911	136911	Addison	310	“ Ai n't a crime to come here without an opinion one way or other . That 's why we talk . "
136967	136980	136981	136981	Doc	287	“ You 're always wanting to play with those guns of yours , "
136997	137019	136993	136993	Rafael	292	“ When you 're the only medical care in the valley , we ai n't doing so well you must admit . "

137049	137061	137062	137062	Rafe	292	“ Oh we 're just talking about our lives is all , ”
137066	137106	137062	137062	Rafe	292	" We would n't want to get personal about it . But I tell you , the doctor here is going to kiss snake 's butt if he thinks I mess with guns just for the fun of it . ”
137107	137114	137030	137030	I	0	“ But you guys are friends — ”

137136	137141	137142	137142	Kathryn	293	“ What about Henry ? ”
137145	137167	137142	137142	Kathryn	293	“ He went to San Diego too , so he 's seen them . What do you think we should do ? ”

137213	137268	137210	137210	I	0	“ If we feel like they 're trying to make us part of San Diego , we can destroy the tracks and be rid of them . If we do n't , we 'll be part of the country again , and we 'll learn a lot more about what 's going on inland . ”
137269	137282	137283	137283	Doc	287	“ I learn all I want to know at the swap meet , ”
137286	137336	137283	137283	Doc	287	" And wrecking the tracks is n't going to stop them coming in boats . If there 's a thousand of them , as they say , and we number , what , sixty?—and most of them kids?—then they can pretty much do what they want with this valley . ”
137337	137346	137347	137347	Cov	434	“ They can whether we agree or not , ”
137350	137371	137347	137347	Cov	434	“ And if we go along with them now , maybe we can get what we want out of it . ”
137389	137432	137386	137386	I	0	“ Doc , I do n't understand you . At the swap meets you 're always grousing for a chance to get THE WILD SHORE 191 back at them for bombing us . Now here we got the chance , and you — "
137433	137441	137442	137442	Doc	287	" We do n't got the chance , "
137445	137451	137442	137442	Doc	287	“ Not a thing 's changed "
137452	137455	137456	137456	Tom	351	“ Enough ! ”
137459	137474	137456	137456	Tom	351	“ We 've heard all that before . Carmen , it 's your turn . "
137482	137570	137479	137479	Carmen	334	“ Nat and I have talked a lot about this one , and we do n't agree , but my thoughts are clear on the matter . This fight the San Diegans want us to join is useless . Killing visitors from Catalina does n't do a thing to make us free . I 'm not against fighting if it would do some good , but this is just murder . Murder is never the means to any good end , so I 'm against joining them . ”
137581	137593	137571	137571	She	334	“ Tom ? You have n't told us your opinion yet . "
137594	137601	137602	137602	I	0	“ The hell he has n't , ”
137641	137666	137635	137635	himself	351	“ What I do n't like about this Danforth is that he tried to make us join him whether we want to or not . ”
137667	137670	137671	137671	Rafael	292	“ How ? ”
137674	137694	137671	137671	Rafael	292	“ He said , we 're either with them or against them . I take that as a threat . "
137695	137709	137710	137710	Rafe	292	“ But what could they do to us if we did n't join ? ”
137713	137725	137710	137710	Rafe	292	“ Bring an army up here and point guns at us ? ”
137726	137747	137748	137748	Rafael	292	“ I do n't know . They do have a lot of guns . And the men to point them . ”
137751	137759	137748	137748	Rafael	292	“ So you 're against helping them . ”
137761	137766	137767	137767	Tom	351	“ I guess so , "
137779	137832	137767	137767	Tom	351	“ I guess I 'd like to have the choice of working with them or not , depending on what they had in mind . Case by case , so to speak . So that we 're not just a distant section of San Diego , doing what they tell us to . "
137833	137848	137849	137849	Recovery	328	" The point is , they ca n't make us do what they say , ”
137852	137865	137849	137849	Recovery	328	“ It 's just an alliance , an agreement on common goals . “
137869	137914	137866	137866	You	3994	” said John Nicolin . Cov started to argue with John , and Rafael was still pressing Tom , so the discussion broke up again , and pretty soon every adult in the room was jawing it , and most of the kids too . “
137923	137924	137916	137916	you	3994	” “
137939	137940	137934	137937	Kim Stanley Robinson gans	287	” “

137967	138181	138182	138182	He	3998	” On it went , arguments busting in on neighboring arguments as the participants heard something they liked or disliked . Fingers were waved under noses , curses flew even around Carmen , Kathryn had Steve by the front of the shirt as she made a point . ... It sounded like we were evenly split , too , so that neither side could win on the volume of their voices . But I could see that we joiners were in trouble . The old man , John Nicolin , Doc Costa , and Carmen Eggloff — all four of them were against , and that was the story right there . Rafael and Recovery and old Mendez were important in the valley , and they had a strong voice in things , but they did n't wield the same sort of influence that the others did . John and Doc circulated around the room arguing and conferring on the sly with Pa and Manuel , Kathryn and Mrs. Mariani ; and I knew which way things were shifting for the vote . At the height of the arguing Odd Roger stood and waved his arms with an absurd gleam of comprehension in his eye . He squawked loudly , and Kathryn scowled . “
138193	138197	138198	138198	he	3998	” she muttered ; "
138208	138239	138275	138275	I	0	" A lot of people were like that , upset that Tom had brought Roger at all . But suddenly Roger broke into English , in a shrill reedy voice : “
138289	138290	138275	138275	I	0	” “
138296	138326	138294	138294	Roger	380	" Tom said , taking his arm and leading him to his corner . When he returned to the hearth Tom shouted the arguments down , vexed at last . “
138346	138369	138336	138336	I	0	” There were plenty of those , but after a lot of bickering over the wording of the proposition we were ready . “
138391	138436	138388	138388	their	4004	" Rafael , the Simpsons , the Mendezes , Marvin and Jo Hamish , Steve , Mando , Nat Eggloff , Pa and me : we raised our hands and helped Gabby 's little brothers and sisters to raise theirs . Sixteen of us . “
138442	138548	138388	138388	their	4004	” Tom , Doc Costa , Carmen ; the Marianis , the Shankses , the THE WILD SHORE 193 Reyes ; and John Nicolin went down the line of his family , pulling up the arms of Teddy and Emilia , Virginia and Joe , Carol and Judith , and even Marie , as if she were one of the kids , which in mental power she was . Little Joe stood at attention , hand high , black hair falling over his face , belly and tiny pecker sticking out under a snot - smeared shirt . Mrs. N. sighed to see that shirt . “
138553	138673	138551	138551	man	5307	” Rafael complained ; but that was the rule . Everyone voted . So there were twenty - three against . But among the adults it was a lot closer , and in the strained silence after Carmen finished counting there were some hard stares exchanged . It was like nothing I had ever seen in the valley . A coming fight can feel good , say at the swap meet when facing off with a scavenger gang ; but in the valley , with no one there but friends and neighbors , it felt bad . Everyone was affected the same way , I think , and no one thought of a way to patch this one up . “
138676	138680	138682	138682	they	4007	” Tom said . “
138700	138701	138691	138691	Jennings	249	” “
138711	138729	138708	138708	they	4009	" Addison Shanks said out of the blue , as if he were stating a general principle . “
138732	138741	138708	138708	they	4009	" Tom said , looking at Add curiously . “
138758	138759	138745	138745	We	4008	” “
138764	138775	138745	138745	We	4008	” Add said , and left , leading Melissa out . “
138783	138797	138781	138781	me	0	” Rafael declared , looking around at us , but especially at John . “
138863	138884	138885	138885	We	4008	" His voice was as bitter as I 'd ever heard it ; not really Rafael 's voice at all . “
138891	138892	138885	138885	We	4008	” “
138909	138920	138894	138894	you	0	” John asked . Rafael gave him an angry look . “
138974	138986	138953	138953	We	4008	” He took in a big breath and let it out . “
139002	139173	138991	138991	I	0	” He threaded his way through the folks still sitting , and left the bathhouse . The meeting was done . I crossed the bathhouse with Steve and Gabby . Steve was doing his best to avoid his pa . In all 194 Kim Stanley Robinson the milling around we saw Del gesture at us , and with a nod to Mando and Kathryn we followed them out . Without a word we trailed up the river path , following someone else 's lanterns . Then over the bridge , to the big boulders at the bottom of the barley field . The boulders were wet , so we could n't sit on them . The wind pushed the trees , and after the bathhouse it was cold enough to give me goosebumps . In the blustery dark my companions were no more than shapes , like knobs on the boulders . Across the river lanterns blinked through the trees , stitching the trails that our neighbors were taking home . "
139181	139186	139187	139187	Rafael	292	" Gabby said scornfully . “
139191	139196	139187	139187	Rafael	292	" Nicolin said bitterly . “

139225	139235	139213	139213	they	4017	" said Kathryn , trying to soothe him . . “
139240	139244	139213	139213	they	4017	” Steve said . “

139262	139266	139213	139213	they	4017	” Kathryn insisted . "
139273	139281	139282	139282	You	4020	” But Steve would n't have it . “
139302	139303	139306	139306	you	4016	” “
139309	139313	139306	139306	you	4016	” Kathryn said . “

139334	139339	139332	139332	you	4020	" Steve accused her . "
139350	139354	139340	139340	I	0	” Kathryn said . "

139372	139409	139365	139365	you	4020	” Nicolin said angrily . Kathryn stopped stepping off her boulder to glare at him . I was glad I was n't Steve at that moment . Without a word she was off toward the bridge . “
139417	139429	139410	139410	You	4020	” Steve shouted after her , his voice hoarse with tension . “
139438	139461	139434	139434	You	4020	” He paced off the boulder into the barley field . I could just make out Kathryn as she crossed the bridge . “
139475	139487	139467	139467	she	4020	" Steve whined . After a long silence , Mando said , “
139494	139500	139501	139501	We	4025	” Del ha - ha'd . “
139511	139512	139513	139513	I	0	” “

139534	139546	139515	139515	everybody	7396	" Gabby said - ready as always to egg Steve on . “
139556	139662	139549	139549	you	0	” Across the river dogs yapped . I saw the moon for a wisp THE WILD SHORE 195 of time , above the scudding clouds . Behind me barley rustled , and I shivered in the cold wind . Something in the shifting shadows made me remember my miserable , desperate hike up the ravine to find Tom and the San Diegans , and the fear came on me again , rustling through me like the wind . It 's so easy to forget what fear feels like . Steve was pacing around the boulders like a wolf caught in a snare . He said , “
139669	139670	139549	139549	you	0	" “
139673	139678	139680	139680	us	4025	" Gab said eagerly . “

140054	140065	140051	140051	Steve	351	“ And that 's what we 're going to do . ”

140596	140610	140611	140611	he	351	“ It may be that the jays ate every bee in this hive , "
140614	140670	140611	140611	he	351	“ This one scrub jay was popping down ten at a meal . I set one of Rafael 's mousetraps on top of the post he was landing on , and when he landed the trap knocked him about fifteen feet . Was he mad ! He cursed me in every language known to jays . "

140752	140772	140611	140611	he	351	" Is not . America was great in the way that whales are great , see what I mean ? ”

140777	140892	140677	140677	I	0	“ You 've gotten remarkably dense lately , you know that ? I mean , America was huge , it was a giant . It swam through the seas eating up all the littler countries — drinking them up as it went along . We were eating up the world , boy , and that 's why the world rose up and put an end to us . So I 'm not contradicting myself . America was great like a whale — it was giant and majestic , but it stank and was a killer . Lots of fish died to make it so big . Now have n't I always taught you that ? ”
140893	140896	140611	140611	he	351	" No . "
140897	140920	140611	140611	he	351	“ The hell I have n't ! What about all those arguments at the swap meet with Doc and Leonard and George ? ”
140921	140984	140985	140985	He	4052	“ There you 're different , but just to rile Doc and Leonard . Here at home you always make America sound like God 's own country . Besides , right in the here and now there 's no doubt we 're being held down , just like Rafe said . We have to fight them , Tom , you know that . ”
141018	141108	141011	141011	he	4052	“ Carmen hit the nail hardest , as usual . Did you listen to her ? I did n't think so . Her point was , murdering those dumb tourists does n't do a thing to change the structure of the situation . Catalina will still be Japanese , satTHE WILD SHORE 199 ellites will still be watching us , we 'll still be inside a quarantine . Even the tourists wo n't stop coming . They 'll just be better armed , and more likely to hurt us . "
141109	141131	141202	141202	you	4054	“ If the Japanese are really trying to keep people away , we could kill all the visitors who sneak in . ”
141132	141141	141202	141202	you	4054	" Maybe so , but the structure remains . "
141142	141190	141011	141011	he	4052	“ But it 's a start . Anything as big as this ca n't be done all at once , and the start will always look small . Why , if you 'd been around during the Revolution , you 'd have been against ever starting it . “

Below us the valley was a patchwork , the fields like gold handkerchiefs dropped on the forest , with gliding patches of sunlight making even larger fields of brilliant green . “

141631	141724	141624	141624	They	4070	” he said . I breathed a sigh of relief to have him off the track . But I felt bad to keep something from him ; I saw that I would be lying to him regularly , from then on . I walked back over to him , and as I watched him work I scraped mud off my heels uneasily . His arguments had a sense that could n't be denied , even though I was sure his conclusions were wrong . Because I wanted his conclusions to be wrong . "

They gave the U.N. a list of all the Americans in Russia , and after that the U.N. was adamant about knowing where we were and what was happening to us . If it were n't for that 202 Kim Stanley Robinson I would n't be speaking English . They would have assimilated us . Or killed us . "
142795	142801	142802	142802	he	441	" I 'm a meteorologist , "
142812	142875	142809	142809	he	441	" I study the weather . Or rather , I did study it . Now I watch a Doppler screen used to predict weather and give severe storm warnings . One of the last fruits of American science , the Doppler systems , as a matter of fact . But they 're old now , and it 's a minor position really . "
142946	143043	143044	143044	I	0	" It 's a complicated question . It 's generally agreed that the war did alter the world 's weather , but how it effected the change is still debated . It 's estimated that three thousand neutron bombs exploded on the continental United States that day in 1984 ; not too much long term radiation was released , luckily for you , but a lot of turbulence was generated in the stratosphere the highest levels of air - and apparently the jet stream altered its course for good . You know about the jet stream ? "
143051	143063	143064	143064	He	441	" I have flown on a jet , how . ever . "
143069	143131	143132	143132	He	441	" At the upper levels of the air the THE WILD SHORE 203 wind is constant , and strong . Big rivers of wind . In the northern hemisphere the jet stream circles around west to east , and zigzags up and down as it goes around the world , about four or five zigs and zags for every trip around . "
143155	143204	143205	143205	He	441	" It varies a little every time , of course , but before the war there was one anchor point , which was your Rocky Mountains . The jet stream invariably curved north around the Rockies , and then back south across the United States , like this . "
143216	143262	143205	143205	He	441	" Since the war , that anchoring point has been gone . The jet stream has cut loose , and now it wanders - sometimes it 's sweeping straight down from Alaska to Mexico , which is why you in California get Arctic weather occasionally . "
143263	143269	143270	143270	I	0	" So that 's it , "
143273	143280	143281	143281	he	441	" That 's part of it , "
143285	143504	143281	143281	he	441	" Weather is such a complex organism , you can never point to any single thing and say , that 's it . The jet stream is on the loose , but tropical storm systems are changed as well — and which caused which ? Or are they causally related ? No one can say . The Pacific high , for instance - this would affect you in southern California - there was a high pressure system , very stable , that sat off the west coast of North America . In the summer it would shift north and sit off California , keeping the jet stream pushed north , in the winter it would descend to an area below Baja California . Now it does n't move north in the summer anymore , and so you are n't protected by it . That 's another big factor ; but again , cause or effect ? And then there 's the dust thrown into the stratosphere by the bombs and the fires , dropping world temperatures by a couple of degrees — and the permanent snowpack that resulted in the Sierra Nevada and the Rockies , generating glaciers that reflect the sunlight and cool things even more ... and the shifting of Pacific currents ... lots of changes . "
143517	143531	143532	143532	I	0	" It sounds as if California 's weather has changed most of all , "
143535	143540	143541	143541	Johnson	441	" Oh , no , "
143544	143645	143541	143541	Johnson	441	" Not at all . California has been strongly affected , no doubt about it like moving fifteen degrees of latitude north — but a few other parts of the world 204 Kim Stanley Robinson have been just as strongly affected , or even more so . Lots of rain in northern Chile!—and my , is that washing all that sand off the Andes into the sea . Tropical heat in Europe during the summer , drought during the monsoon - oh , I could go on and on . It has caused more human misery than you can imagine . "
143646	143653	143851	143852	the conductors	4098	" Do n't be so sure . "
143654	143703	143541	143541	Johnson	441	“ Ah . Yes . Well , it is n't only the Soviets ' gray empire that has made the world such a sad place since the war ; the weather has had a large part in it . Happily Russia itself has not gone unaffected . ' · "
143707	143841	143541	143541	Johnson	441	" He shook his head , and would n't elaborate . Two days later - still in Siberia , despite our speedsaw what he meant . We spent the morning out in the corridor of our car , exhibiting our travelling papers to a trio of suspicious conductors . The fact that I spoke not a word of Russian was a real stumbling block to their acceptance of us , and I chattered at them in Japanese and fake Japanese in a nervous attempt to assure them I was from Tokyo as my papers declared me to be , hoping they would not know how unlikely that was . Luckily our papers were authentic , and they left satisfied . When they were gone Johnson was too upset to return to our compartment . "
143897	144037	143886	143886	I	0	" We were still out in the corridor , leaning against the windows , when the train came to a halt , out in the middle of the endless Siberian forest , with not a sign of civilization in sight . Tree - covered hills extended away in every direction for as far as the eye could see ; we crossed a rolling green plane , under a low blue hemisphere filled with even lower clouds . I stopped my description of California , which Johnson could not get enough of , and we leaned out the window looking toward the front of the train . To the west the clouds , which had been low and dark , were now a solid black line . When Johnson saw this he leaned far out of the window , saying , "
144049	144077	144078	144078	Tornado	443	" When he THE WILD SHORE 205 slid back in there was a fierce grin on his usually dour face . Leaning close to me he whispered , “
144080	144097	144078	144078	Tornado	443	" Within a few minutes conductors arrived in our car and instructed everyone to get off . "
144106	144110	144078	144078	Tornado	443	" Johnson declared . "
144122	144132	144114	144114	I	0	" Nevertheless we joined the crowd before the door . "
144141	144157	144135	144135	they	4102	" I asked , trying to keep an eye on the clouds to the west . "
144197	144206	144135	144135	they	4102	" This was not very reassuring to me . "
144214	144221	144135	144135	they	4102	" Johnson nodded with grim satisfaction . "
144259	144260	144261	144261	I	0	" "
144267	144268	144261	144261	I	0	" "
144322	144343	144345	144345	they	4107	" Our fellow travellers were staring at us , and Johnson waited to continue until we were off the train . "
144366	144457	144463	144463	I	0	" The conductors herded us to a clearing beside the track , at the very end of the train . Black clouds covered the sky , and a cold wind made a ripping sound in the trees . The wind grew stronger in a matter of minutes ; leaves and small branches fell almost horizontally through the air above us , and by drawing just a few feet apart from the rest of the passengers , we could talk without being overheard ; indeed , we could barely hear ourselves . "
144466	144470	144463	144463	I	0	" Johnson said . "
144478	144479	144463	144463	I	0	" "
144485	144508	144480	144480	You	0	" I said in surprise , thinking I had misunderstood , for to tell the truth Johnson 's English was accented somewhat . "
144511	144533	144480	144480	You	0	" he hissed , his face close to mine . In the muted green light he suddenly looked wild , fanatical . "
144557	144558	144545	144545	you	0	" “
144571	144572	144545	144545	you	0	" "
144576	144588	144545	144545	you	0	" he said angrily , and grabbed me by the arm . "
144721	144802	144690	144690	you	4115	" I looked in the direction he was pointing and saw that the black cloud to the west now sank to the earth at a certain point , in a broad , swirling black funnel of cloud . The wind howled around us , tearing at my hair , and yet I could still hear a low grinding noise , a vibration in the ground , as if a train many times larger than ours was speeding along distant tracks . "
144809	144816	144690	144690	you	4115	" Johnson shouted in my ear . “
144823	145279	144690	144690	you	4115	" On his bearded , craggy face was an expression of religious rapture . The tornado now slimmed to a black column , spinning furiously on itself . At its base I could make out whole trees flying away from it , scores of them . The bass roar of it grew ; some of the Russians in the clearing fell to the ground , others knelt and prayed , raising twisted faces to the black sky ; Johnson waved a fist at them , shouting soundlessly in the roar , his face contorted . The twister must have struck Karymskoye , because the flying trees were replaced by debris , pieces of a city reduced to rubble in an instant . Johnson danced a little tilted jig , leaning into the wind . I myself kept an eye on the unearthly storm . It was moving from left to right ahead of us , approaching at an angle . The condensed spinning column was so solidly black that it might have been a tower of whirling coal . The bottom of this tower bounced off the ground from time to time ; it touched down on a hill past the stricken town , blasted trees away from it , bounced into the air almost up to the black cloud above it , extended and touched down again , moved on . To my considerable relief it appeared that it would pass THE WILD SHORE 207 to the north of us by three or four miles . When I was sure of that , some of Johnson 's strange elation spilled into me . I had just seen a town destroyed . But the Soviet Union was responsible for my country 's destruction — thousands of towns — so Johnson had said , and I believed him . That made this storm retribution , even revenge . I shouted at the top of my lungs , felt the sound get torn away and carried off . I screamed again . I had not known how much I would welcome a blow struck against the murderers of my country - how much I needed it . Johnson pounded my shoulder and wiped tears from his eyes , we staggered against the wind across the clearing and into some trees , where we could scream and point and laugh and kick trees , and cry and shout curses too terrible to be heard , lamentations too awful to be thought . Our country was dead , and this poor exile my guide felt it as powerfully as I did . I put my arm around him and felt that I held up a countryman , a brother . "
145282	145289	144690	144690	you	4115	" he hissed again and again . "
145296	145329	144690	144690	you	4115	" Within twenty minutes the tornado bounced back up into the cloud for good , and we were left in a stiff cold wind to compose ourselves . Johnson wiped his eyes . "
145340	145349	144690	144690	you	4115	" he said in his slightly guttural accent , "
145358	145385	145386	145386	I	0	" A shadow fell across the book , and Steve stopped reading . We all looked up . John Nicolin stood there , hands on hips . “

I held my breath , disoriented by the abrupt removal from the story . John dropped the book on the grass . “
145521	145522	145515	145515	you	4119	” “
145525	145656	145515	145515	you	4119	” said Steve . He was looking down at the book now . He stretched to pick it back up , and John walked away . Steve kept inspecting the book for grass stains , avoiding our gazes . I wished I was n't there to see it . I knew how Steve felt about having such scenes observed . And here were Kathryn , Mando , Kathryn 's mother and sister and the others . ... I watched John 's 208 Kim Stanley Robinson wide back disappear down the river path and cursed him in my thoughts . There was no call for that sort of showing it over Steve . That was pure meanness- no past could excuse it . I was glad he was n't my father . "

' So the Volvo is still hanging in there , ' he said . We got in . And the two of us sitting there , side by side in the 216 Kim Stanley Robinson car , made me feel so strange I could hardly start the engine .

In the end we pinned down the moment exactly : the morning I left for New York , driving before sunrise in the raw dawn silence , there was a moment getting on Highway Forty when I could n't remember if the onramp was a simple left turn , or a cloverleaf circle to the right ; and while I was still thinking about it I came to , already on the freeway headed east .

He told me what he had done , and it sounded great . Fishing in Alaska , mapping rivers in the Yukon , collecting animal skeletons for the fish and game service - hard work , out in the world . How his stories made me laugh ! And from him I heard my laugh like other people heard it , and it only made me laugh the harder . What a crazy howl ! Has it ever occurred to you that other people see you in the same way you see them , as a collection of appearances and habits and actions and words that they never get to see your thoughts , to know how wonderful you really are ? So that you seem as strange to them as they all appear to you ? Well , that night I got to look at myself from the outside , and he sure was a funny guy . “

He had made the strong choice , I the weak -- didn't it make sense that I was no more than a ghost come to haunt him , a vision of what would have happened if he had made the mistake of returning to New York ? “
150079	150095	150062	150062	He	0	“ I guess we 're both here , ' I admitted . But how ? ' “
150110	150119	150120	150120	I	0	“ That was why we had trouble sleeping . “
150149	150160	150141	150141	I	0	“ Me too , ' he said , surprising me . “
150233	150264	150192	150192	He	0	“ So he had his troubles too . But they sounded like nothing compared to mine . He was healthier and happier than I , surely . 218 Kim Stanley Robinson “
150359	150440	150343	150343	We	4219	“ Do you remember this ? ' ' Oh , yeah . ' ' Do you remember that ? ' ' Oh man , I never wanted anyone else to find out about that . ' And so on . It was pretty friendly , but it was n't comfortable . We could n't talk about our different lives anymore , because there was something wrong there , a tension , a disagreement even though neither of us was satisfied . “
150560	150628	150629	150629	I	0	“ But right in the middle of our howling the Volvo sputtered , at the top of another rise . I pressed on the gas , but the engine died . I coasted onto the shoulder and tried to start it . No luck . ' Sounds like water in the distributor , ' my double said . ' Did n't you ever get that fixed ? ' “
150870	150983	150861	150862	my double	7899	“ All right ! ' he cried , and slapped my hand , and suddenly he leaped up and spun in the air , howling out the vowel - y Navaho chant we had learned as a boy- and there I was spinning with him , swirling my poncho out like a Hopi dancing cape , screaming my lungs out . Oh it was a strange sight , the two of us dancing in front of that car , on that high ridge , hollering and spinning and stomping in puddles , and I felt - oh there is n't the word for the way I felt at that moment , truly . “
151025	151063	151007	151007	We	4219	“ My life feels like this , ' one of us said , but I was n't sure who . And my right arm was hot , where it touched his left arm . I looked at it- “
151109	151198	151199	151199	I	0	" On the forearm wavering between us I could make out the reddish tissue connecting our arms , like burn - scar tissue . And I could feel the hot pulling and plucking . We were melting together ! Already we shared part of the upper arm , and soon we would be joined at the shoulder like Siamese twins , and I felt the same burning in my right leg , oh , our time was up ! First arms and legs , then torso then heads ! "
151239	151247	151248	151248	We	4219	“ ' Pull , ' he said . “
151365	151425	151426	151426	I	0	“ Hold on tight , ' I gasped , and dove for the road ! Boom ! Rip!-an instant of agony , and I crashed onto wet asphalt . I pushed myself up with both hands . My feet were both there . I shook my right hand violently , grabbed my right boot . I was whole again . “
151541	151567	151574	151574	he	7899	“ But that was a vision I had . In actuality , he shook his head hard , his lip curled into a bitter look . “
151577	151587	151574	151574	he	7899	“ Said I , ' I think you better . ”
151620	151647	151607	151607	He	7899	“ Back to home for you , eh Thomas ? ' he said . There was contempt in his voice , and suddenly I was angry . “
151660	151733	151657	151657	I	0	“ And I 'm glad to see you go . You had me feeling like my whole life was a mistake , like you did it right and I did it wrong . But I 'm not doing it wrong ! I 'm living with people the way a human being should , and you 're just taking the escape , wandering the road . You 'll burn out quick enough . ' "
151792	151832	151789	151789	he	7899	“ I do n't know if we live in the same world or not , but someone might notice . So you keep the name . I have the feeling you 're the real Tom Barnard , anyway . ' “
151839	151943	151789	151789	he	7899	“ He looked at me one last time . ' Good luck , ' he said . Then he walked away from the road , up the ridge . Through the mist , under that poncho , he looked inhuman . But I knew who he THE WILD SHORE 221 was . And as I watched him fade into the dark and the shrubs my spirit sank , and I was filled with despair . That was my own self disappearing there ; I was watching my own true self walk away in the rain . No one should have to watch that . “
152119	152141	152102	152102	he	4253	” Tom coughed a few times , and stared into the fire , remembering it . We watched him open mouthed . “
152149	152176	152143	152143	you	0	” Rebel asked anxiously . That broke the spell and most of us laughed , including Tom . But then he frowned at her and nodded . “
152190	152212	152182	152182	him	4253	” We settled back ; the older folks , who had heard this story before , I guessed , looked surprised . "
152265	152283	152229	152229	I	0	” At that point Tom looked at me , as if to make sure I was listening . “
152353	152470	152345	152345	myself	0	“ Part of me knew that it made no sense , and I fought back in a weak sort of way . At this time I was out west doing that again , hiking a little . I decided to hike to the top of Mount Whitney , the tallest mountain in the United States . Weak as I was it was a killer task just to get up that ten mile trail , but 222 Kim Stanley Robinson after a couple days ' hard work I made it . Mount Whitney . Right before sunset , this was — again — so that I was the only person on the peak , which was rare . “
152665	152713	152635	152635	It	4263	“ Well , I thought about hightailing it down the trail , but at one point when he looked up at me , I saw that he recognized me too , and I realized we would have to say hello . Or something . So I waited . “
152821	152827	152829	152829	Tom	351	“ And then it happened . ”
152876	152956	152866	152866	He	351	“ The sun was about half an orange ball lying out on the horizon , and — and one bloomed beside it , and then a whole bunch of others , up and down the California coast . Fifty suns all strung out and glowing for sunset . The mushroom balls as tall as us , and then taller . Little haloes of smoke around each column . It was the day , folks . It was the end . “
153102	153132	153094	153094	I	0	” He leaned back and almost rocked too far in his chair . We all took a deep breath . Tom stood and prodded the fire with a stick . “
153148	153160	153136	153136	you	0	” he said , his voice relaxed again , even peevish . “
153177	153178	153182	153182	you	0	” “
153185	153189	153190	153190	You	0	” Rafael said . “
153202	153214	153200	153200	you	0	" John Nicolin nodded at that . The old man blinked . “
153248	153291	153293	153295	the old man	5280	” With a cough he went to get the drink himself , and released us . Some stood and threw wood on the fire , others asked Mrs. N. if there was more butter - all a bit subdued , but satisfied . “
153298	153385	153293	153295	the old man	5280	” Steve said . Then he took my arm and indicated Melissa , over on the other side of the fire . I shrugged him off , but after a bit I walked around the fire and joined her . She put her arm around me . Feeling that small hand over my hip made the rum in me jump . We wandered out in the junk of the yard , and kissed hungrily . I was always surprised at how easy it was with Melissa . “
153389	153393	153394	153394	You	4277	” she said . “
153440	153498	153434	153434	he	4279	” I agreed quickly , thinking more about her kisses than the information I was supposed to get from Add . But when it occurred to me ( while nuzzling Melissa 's neck , so beautiful in the firelight ) , I was pretty pleased with myself . It was going to be easier than I thought . “
153508	153530	153434	153434	he	4279	” I said . A while later we had found the rum and downed it , and Addison had found us . “
153536	153547	153434	153434	he	4279	” he said to Melissa gruffly . 224 Kim Stanley Robinson "
153553	153557	153434	153434	he	4279	" she said . “
153579	153580	153565	153565	I	0	" "
153583	153877	153565	153565	I	0	” Add said indifferently . I waved goodbye to Steve and Kathryn behind Melissa 's back , and felt pretty slick when I saw Steve 's startled expression . The three of us took off down the ridge trail . Add led Melissa and me across the valley without a word or a look back , so he did n't see Melissa 's arm around my waist , nor her hand in my pocket . The pocket had a hole convenient to her , but I was none too comfortable with Add right in front of us , and I did n't respond except with a kiss on the bridge , where I could trust my footing . Stumbling along the path up Basilone I could feel the rum in my blood , and Melissa 's fingers groping in my pants . Whew ! But at the same time I was thinking , how am I going to ask Add about the scavengers and the Japanese ? The rum sloshed my thoughts when I considered it , but it was more than the drink . There was n't a good way , that was all there was to it . I would have to cast without bait and hope for the best . The Shanks house was one of the old ones , built by Add before hardly anybody lived in Onofre . He had used an electric wire tower as the framework of the place , so it was small but tall , and strong as a tree . The shingled walls sloped inward slightly , and the four metal struts of the tower protruded from the corners of the roof , meeting in a tangle of metal far above it . . “
153882	153937	153938	153938	We	4282	" Add said hospitably , and took a key from his pocket to unlock the door . Once inside he struck a match and lit a lantern , and the smell of burnt whale oil filled the room . Boxes and tools were stacked against the walls , but there was n't any furniture . "
153942	154092	153938	153938	We	4282	” Melissa said as Add led us up a steep plank staircase in one corner . She giggled and pushed my butt as she followed me up , and I almost banged into one of the thick metal struts of the old electric tower . Nobody from Onofre Valley had ever been on the second floor , as far as I knew . But it was nothing special : kitchen in one corner , blond wood tables , an old couch and some chairs . Scavenger stuff all . A stairway leading to a trapdoor indicated another floor above . Add set the lantern on the stove , and commenced opening windows and throwing back the shutters guarding them . There were a lot of shutters . When he was done we had a view in all four directions : dark treetops , every way . THE WILD SHORE 225 “
154101	154112	154093	154093	You	4284	” I said , rum - wise . Add nodded . “
154117	154121	154122	154122	I	0	” he said . "
154129	154158	154122	154122	I	0	” Melissa said , and went up the stairway to the floor above . I sat in one of the big upholstered chairs , across from the couch . “
154167	154202	154161	154161	you	4284	" I asked , hoping that would be a start on my ultimate subject . But Add knew that I knew where the glass came from , and he gave me a crooked smile . “
154225	154247	154215	154215	I	0	” . I was fine on rum already , as I 've mentioned , but I took a glass from him . “
154255	154268	154215	154215	I	0	” Add said , and took back the glass while I moved . “
154304	154305	154301	154301	I	0	” “
154312	154319	154301	154301	I	0	” He laughed long and loud . “
154330	154337	154325	154325	I	0	” He sipped from his glass . “
154352	154356	154357	154357	We	4290	“ So do l. "
154490	154498	154499	154499	Melissa	309	“ Good rum , is n't it ? "
154508	154527	154499	154499	Melissa	309	“ We traded two - dozen crabs for it . We only trade for the best rum available . ”
154528	154541	154542	154542	Add	430	“ I wish we were going to be trading with San Diego , "
154546	154558	154542	154542	Add	430	“ Was San Diego as big as Tom said it is ? ”
154559	154562	154563	154563	I	0	“ Sure , "
154566	154570	154563	154563	I	0	" Maybe bigger . "
154579	154587	154573	154573	her	309	“ Did you like it down there ? ”
154588	154604	154606	154608	Kim Stanley Robinson	287	“ I guess so . It was quite a trip , I 'll say that . ”
154655	154663	154664	154664	Add	430	“ And he does that every morning ? "
154673	154678	154664	154664	Add	430	“ So they said . "
154679	154690	154691	154691	he	430	" That must mean they have a lot of ammunition , "
154699	154707	154691	154691	he	430	“ Hey , this bottle 's polished . ”
154708	154714	154715	154715	I	0	“ You bet they do , "
154747	154769	154738	154738	I	0	“ They 've got all those naval warehouses down there , and the Mayor has had every one of them explored . ”
154770	154787	154790	154790	his	430	" Uh huh . One moment ; I have to go downstairs and get another bottle . ”
155064	155073	155074	155074	I	0	“ Does n't lightning ever hit your house ? ”
155077	155080	155081	155081	they	4305	“ Sure , ”
155092	155117	155088	155088	Add	430	“ Sometimes it 'll hit and a whole wall of shingles will pop off . Later when I check them they look all singed . "
155118	155126	155128	155128	Melissa	309	“ My hair stands right on end , ”
155134	155143	155144	155144	I	0	“ Are n't you afraid of being electrocuted ? ”
155154	155159	155160	155160	Add	430	“ No , no , ”
155163	155171	155160	155160	Add	430	“ We 're pretty well grounded here . "
155172	155178	155088	155088	Add	430	“ What 's that mean ? ”
155179	155236	155160	155160	Add	430	“ It means the lightning runs down the corner poles into the ground . I had Rafe out to look at the place , and he said we 're in no danger . I like to remember that when the lightning hits and the whole house shakes , and blue sparks are bouncing around like hummingbirds . "
155237	155242	155243	155243	Melissa	309	“ It 's exciting , ”
155246	155251	155243	155243	Melissa	309	“ I like it . ”
155365	155380	155381	155381	he	430	“ So what do you think that Mayor of San Diego is really after ? ”
155384	155390	155381	155381	he	430	" I do n't know , "
155418	155430	155412	155412	Add	430	“ Does he want to be king of this whole coastline ? ”
155431	155450	155412	155412	Add	430	“ I do n't think so . He wants the Japanese off the mainland , that 's all . ”
155451	155474	155412	155412	Add	430	“ Ah . That 's what you said before , in the meeting . I do n't know if I believe it . "
155475	155479	155412	155412	Add	430	“ Why not ? "
155480	155502	155412	155412	Add	430	“ There 's no sense to it . How many men does he have working for him , did you say ? "
155503	155518	155412	155412	Add	430	“ I do n't think I said . I never really knew , exactly . ”
155519	155527	155412	155412	Add	430	“ Do they have any radio gear ? ”
155528	155553	155412	155412	Add	430	“ Why , how did you guess ? They 've got a big old radio down there , but it does n't work yet . ”
155554	155557	155412	155412	Add	430	“ No ? ”
155558	155581	155412	155412	Add	430	“ Not yet , but they said they were planning to get a man over from the Salton Sea to fix it . ”
155582	155589	155412	155412	Add	430	“ Who said this , now ? "
155590	155600	155412	155412	Add	430	“ The folks in San Diego . The Mayor . ”
155601	155608	155412	155412	Add	430	“ Well what do you know . "
155632	155644	155629	155629	my	0	“ Add , where did you get all this glass from ? "
155645	155655	155656	155656	He	4307	" Why , at the swap meets , mostly . "
155673	155678	155664	155664	they	4308	" From the scavengers ? ”
155679	155693	155694	155694	I	0	" Sure . They 're the ones selling glass , are n't they ? ”
155705	155725	155694	155694	I	0	“ Do you ever trade directly with the scavengers , Add ? I mean , outside the swap meets ? ”
155726	155735	155736	155736	He	4307	“ Why no . Why do you ask ? ”
155754	155758	155759	155759	I	0	" No reason , "
155781	155790	155768	155768	he	4307	“ I was wondering , that 's all . "
155791	155794	155795	155795	he	4307	“ Nope , ”
155799	155835	155795	155795	he	4307	" I never deal with the zopilotes , no matter what you hear . I trap crabs under Trestles , so I 'm up there a lot , but that 's the extent of it . "
155836	155842	155843	155843	Melissa	309	" They lie about us , "
155847	155851	155852	155852	Add	430	“ No matter , "
155861	155874	155852	155852	Add	430	“ Everyone collects stories of one sort of another , I reckon . "
155875	155878	155879	155879	I	0	“ True , "
156060	156095	156047	156047	Add	430	" It 's been fun , but it 's getting late . Melissa , you and I ought to be abed . We 've got lots of work to do in the morning . ' “
156100	156101	156098	156098	Daddy	395	" “
156126	156154	156114	156114	Henry	284	" I got to my feet , unsteady but eager , and Add shook my hand , THE WILD SHORE 229 squeezing hard and grinning at me . “
156159	156160	156114	156114	Henry	284	” "
156170	156274	156168	156168	Add	430	" I followed Melissa down the ladder to the ground floor , and then out the door into the night . We kissed . I leaned back against the sloping wall of their house to keep myself upright , one leg thrust between Melissa 's as she pressed against me . It reminded me of the first time we fooled around at the swap meet , only this time I was drunker . Melissa rubbed up and down my thigh , and let me feel her some more as she kissed my neck and breathed umm , umm , very softly . Then : “
156285	156286	156279	156279	I	0	" "
156289	156290	156279	156279	I	0	” "
156296	156839	156294	156294	Henry	284	” A peck on the nose and she was gone . I shoved off from the wall and staggered across the little clearing into the woods . There were foundations out there from the old time , the remnants of houses it looked like . Everything was gone except the concrete slabs , cracking under the weeds . I stumbled onto one of these and sat down for a bit , looking back through the trees at the Shankses ' tower . There was a silhouette in front of the lights in the living room . I tasted the finger that had been feeling Melissa . The blood rushed to my head . It seemed a terrible amount of trouble to stand again , so I sat awhile and recalled the feel of her . I could see her , too — the silhouette was her -moving about the kitchen part of the upper room . Cleaning , I guessed . I do n't know how much time passed , but suddenly their kitchen lantern went dark , then reappeared — once , twice , three and then four times . That seemed a little odd . Off to my right I heard a twig snap . I knew instantly it was people , walking over another foundation . I crawled silently between two large trees and listened . Around to the north of the house there were people , at least two of them , not doing a very good job of moving through the woods quietly . Valley people would never have made such noise . And there was no reason for any of them to be up there anyway . All this occurred to me rapidly , no matter that I was drunk . Without thinking about it I found myself flat on my stomach behind a tree , where I could see the Shankses ' door . Sure enough , shadows on the other side of the little clearing resolved into moving shapes , then into people , three of them . They walked right up to the door , said something up at the second story . It was Melissa who let them in . While they were still on 230 Kim Stanley Robinson the first floor I slipped through the trees quiet as owlflight , and hauled butt over to the wall of their house . I blessed my speed ( fastest in Onofre by far ) and held my breath . Only then did I wonder if I really wanted to be there . That 's drunkenness for you — sometimes it can speed action by cutting out the thought . From the ground I could hear their voices , but I could n't make out enough of what they were saying to make sense of it . I remembered seeing blocks of wood nailed to the side of the house next to the door , making a ladder to the roof . I shifted along the wall to them , and step by step I ascended the blocks , taking a minute for each block so they would n't creak . When my head was under one of the windows I stopped and listened .

156846	156850	156851	156851	He	4319	” Addison said . “
156875	156876	156860	156860	they	4318	” "
156882	156895	156896	156896	Danforth	344	” said a nasal , high voice . A deeper voice added : “
156926	156927	156919	156919	he	344	” "
156930	156934	156919	156919	he	344	" Add said . “
156946	157021	157022	157022	He	344	” They had been pumping me ! Here I had gone up there thinking to pump them for information , and they had been pumping me instead . My face burned . And what was worse , Melissa had probably arranged with Add to come on to me after I had gotten good and drunk , to distract my attention from the questions ! Now that was ugly . And then Melissa said scornfully , “
157035	157037	157038	157038	He	344	” . "
157042	157047	157038	157038	He	344	" Add corrected her . “
157092	157093	157082	157082	he	344	” “
157101	157105	157082	157082	he	344	” Melissa said . “
157114	157310	157109	157109	his	344	" One of the scavengers was moving about the room , and I could make out the bulk of him as he passed above me . I pressed into the wall and tried to look like a shingle . If they caught me ... well , I could beat any of them through the woods at night . Unless I fell . I was in no shape for running , and suddenly I was scared , like I should have been all along . They continued to discuss the San Diegans , and Addison THE WILD SHORE 231 and Melissa told them everything I had said . I was surprised at how much I had told them ; I did n't even remember some of it . They had pumped me good , that was sure . And I had n't learned a thing from them . I felt like a fool , and gritted my teeth with dislike for those two . But now I was getting back at them . And despite what she had done and what she was saying , part of me wanted to get Melissa 's dress up again . “
157324	157330	157109	157109	his	344	” the nasal one said . “
157360	157361	157362	157362	They	4323	" “
157368	157372	157362	157362	They	4323	" Add said . “
157397	157398	157386	157386	they	4323	” “
157411	157424	157399	157399	They	4323	" the man above me said . He was facing my way . “
157440	157441	157399	157399	They	4323	” “
157457	157465	157450	157450	they	4323	" The nasal one seemed to agree : “
157487	157527	157478	157478	he	344	" They discussed Danforth and his men in some detail , and on my wooden step I trembled . To know so much they must have spies everywhere ! We were ignorant simpletons , compared to such a network . "
157533	157539	157540	157540	I	0	” said the nasal guy . “
157550	158039	157540	157540	I	0	” He went on , but the moment he mentioned leaving I started inching down the blocks , shifting my weight ever so slowly , and praying that the man above me was looking into the room . I was stuck against the house ; no matter which way I left , there was a good chance someone would see me . The shortest gap was to the west , so I went to that side of the building and waited . Had they started downstairs ? I guessed that they had , and stole off into the trees . Foxes could n't have crossed that ground as fast as I did . Sure enough , the scavengers quickly appeared at the front door , and I saw Melissa in the doorway waving goodbye , still in her white dress . I was tempted to approach the house again and spy on the two of them , but I did n't want to press my luck . As long as they did n't know I had overheard their meeting with the scavengers , I had turned the tables on them . That felt 232 Kim Stanley Robinson good . I started off for the river , walking slowly and quietly . In the end I had gotten more information than they had , and they still thought I was a dimwit ; that might give me an advantage later . I wanted fiercely to get back at them . If only the scavengers had said exactly when the Japanese landing was going to be .... But I knew it was to be soon , and at Dana Point , and that was something substantial to tell Steve . Would I have a story for him . He would be envious again , I judged with drunken clarity . But I did n't care . I would get the Shankses — show Steve what I could do - whip the Japanese -get Melissa 's dress off — triumph every which wayA tree creaked and I jumped out of my shoes , practically . I started paying attention to my progress through the forest . It took a long time to get home , and then a long time to get to sleep . Such a night ! I recalled hanging on the wall of the Shankses ' house . Why , I had done it again . That Melissa , though — she had hurt my feelings . But all in all I felt good . Escaping the Japanese ship , foxing scavengers and their spies ... smart work all round . ... After some more of this drunken fuddle I fell asleep . That night I dreamt there were two of me , chased by two of the Japanese captain , and in a house over the river that did n't exist two Kathryns rescued us . Chapter Fifteen "
158044	158079	158042	158042	Henry	284	” Steve said when I told him about my night ( juicing it up a little , and leaving out the part where Add and Melissa had pumped me for everything I knew ) , “
158110	158111	158105	158105	you	284	” “
158121	158125	158126	158126	Add	430	” I demanded . “
158144	158150	158139	158139	you	0	” , He looked offended . “
158161	158162	158151	158151	You	0	” “
158172	158173	158164	158164	I	0	" “
158184	158189	158191	158191	we	4332	" he suggested dubiously . “
158194	158325	158191	158191	we	4332	” We went back to fishing in silence . Sun smashing down on the water and breaking bright white over every swell . Hot days like this were my special joy — the hillsides steamed , the water and sky were two shades of the same rich blue - but on this day I was n't paying much attention to it . Steve 233 234 Kim Stanley Robinson was speculating about how we might spy on Add , and planning what he would say to Lee and Jennings . He had worked out everything he was going to say to them to convince them to let us guide them into Orange . As we rowed back to the rivermouth I spoke for the first time since telling him my story : "
158347	158348	158338	158338	Jennings	249	" "
158352	158353	158360	158360	him	249	” “
158362	158435	158436	158436	Steve	351	” Even with his face smaller than my little fingernail I knew him . At the sight of him all my San Diego trip came back to me at once , as something that had really happened to me . It made me shiver . There was no sight of Lee . Jennings was talking as usual . Now that I could see him in the flesh our whole plan seemed foolish . “
158469	158470	158471	158471	They	1021	” “
158499	158500	158497	158497	you	284	” “

158552	158574	158547	158547	they	1021	” He rowed like he was in a race to the flats . As we grounded over the sand I said , "
158584	158599	158547	158547	they	1021	” We jumped out and lifted the boat forward on the next spent swell . “
158626	158627	158612	158612	I	0	” “
158634	158636	158612	158612	I	0	" . “
158650	158684	158642	158642	Pa	286	" I picked up a pair of rock bass by the gills and trundled slowly across the rimpled sand to the cleaning tables , walking right behind Jennings . He turned and said , “
158699	158700	158704	158705	Mr. Jennings	249	” “
158712	158713	158709	158710	Mr. Lee	451	” “
158718	158723	158724	158724	He	451	" His eyes narrowed . “
158737	158756	158732	158732	He	451	" The two men with Jennings ( one had been on my train , I thought ) smirked . "
158760	158769	158732	158732	He	451	” That was too bad , I thought . “
158802	158803	158790	158790	He	451	" “
158812	158816	158790	158790	He	451	" John said , “

158827	158831	158790	158790	He	451	” I said . “
158835	158842	158848	158848	friend	4345	” John said . Jennings said , “
158850	158881	158848	158848	friend	4345	” I carried the bass up to the cleaning tables and said hello to the girls . Walking back to the boat I passed Steve , then heard John say , “
158903	158904	158894	158894	We	4339	” “
158910	158914	158894	158894	We	4339	” Jennings said , “

158952	158996	158997	158997	Barnard	351	" And then I was out of earshot . It was tough hearing their voices with the gulls stooping us and screeching over the offal . I picked up a bonita and another bass and hurried back . Steve was just past them . “
159004	159008	158997	158997	Barnard	351	” Jennings said . “
159019	159020	159012	159012	he	351	” "
159040	159050	159012	159012	he	351	" Over at the cleaning tables Mrs. Nicolin said , “
159059	159060	159053	159054	that man	4353	” "
159079	159080	159061	159061	He	351	” “

159136	159150	159151	159152	The Mayor	5274	" Steve nudged me from behind , and I turned to walk back . "
159160	159165	159151	159152	The Mayor	5274	” Jennings was saying . “
159203	159204	159191	159191	you	249	" "
159206	159215	159216	159216	John	278	“ You know what 's going on here ? ”
159224	159230	159231	159231	he	278	“ You kids clear out , ”
159296	159303	159304	159304	Steve	351	“ That guy is a fool , ”
159312	159330	159304	159304	Steve	351	“ I do n't think so . The old man is sick , did you know that ? "
159331	159334	159335	159335	He	351	“ Yeah . ”
159341	159349	159350	159350	He	351	“ Why did n't you tell me ? ”
159355	159367	159350	159350	He	351	“ I 'm going to go see how he 's doing . ”
159409	159413	159414	159414	Steve	351	“ Not yet , ”
159417	159436	159414	159414	Steve	351	“ When that guy gives up on Pa we can catch him alone and tell him our plan . ”

159445	159462	159441	159441	I	0	" His name is Jennings . You 'd better know that when you talk to him . ”
159470	159475	159463	159463	Steve	351	“ I knew it . ”
159537	159545	159546	159546	Steve	351	“ Let 's get out of sight , ”
159576	159583	159584	159584	I	0	“ Okay , let 's go , ”
159592	159598	159599	159599	he	351	“ We 'll follow them , ”

159625	159634	159636	159636	they	4374	“ Okay , but do n't surprise them . ”
159664	159669	159670	159670	Steve	351	" There they are , ”
159706	159718	159703	159703	Steve	351	“ In these woods is as good a place as any . "
159719	159723	159755	159755	he	453	“ Uh huh . ”
159724	159732	159755	159755	he	453	“ Well , let 's stop them . ”

159850	159861	159846	159846	he	249	“ You should n't be surprising people in the woods . "
159862	159865	159866	159866	I	0	“ Sorry , ”
159879	159885	159886	159886	Jennings	249	“ What do you want ? ”
159897	159905	159906	159906	Steve	351	“ We want to talk with you , "
159909	159923	159906	159906	Steve	351	“ I heard that . So speak up ; what do you want ? ”
159930	159978	159927	159927	Steve	351	“ We want to join the resistance . Not everyone in the valley is against helping you . In fact , it was a damn close vote . If some of us were to help you , the rest of the valley might come along , eventually . "
159994	160028	159987	159987	Jennings	249	“ That 's a good thought , friend , but what we really need is access through your valley to the north , and I do n't think you can give us that . ”
160029	160074	160075	160075	I	0	“ No , we ca n't . But we can guide you when you 're up in Orange , and that 's more important . If that goes right , like I said , the rest of the valley will probably join in later . ”
160090	160100	160101	160101	Steve	351	“ We know scavengers who are on our side , ”
160105	160122	160101	160101	Steve	351	“ We can find out from them when the Japanese will be landing , and where . "
160123	160130	160131	160131	Jennings	249	“ Who can tell you that ? ”
160136	160141	160142	160142	Steve	351	“ People we know , ”
160156	160224	160225	160225	Jennings	249	" There are scavengers up there who know about the scavengers dealing with the Japanese , and they do n't like it . There 's not much they can do about it , but they can tell us , and then we 'll do something about it , right ? We 've been up there a lot , we know the lay of the land and everything . "
160228	160236	160225	160225	Jennings	249	“ We could use information like that . "
160238	160246	160225	160225	Jennings	249	" Well , we can do it . ”
160251	160258	160260	160260	he	453	“ Good . That 's good . ”
160263	160277	160260	160260	he	453	“ We might make arrangements for getting information from you now and then . "
160278	160287	160288	160288	Steve	351	“ We want to do more than that , ”
160292	160368	160288	160288	Steve	351	“ We can guide you up to whatever spot the Japanese are landing at , no matter where it is . There are n't any of you know the ruins like we do . We 've been up there at night a whole bunch of times . If you 're going up there on a raid , you 'll need to have someone who knows the land , to get you there and back fast . ”
160387	160400	160401	160401	Steve	351	“ We want to go up there with you and fight them , ”
160406	160461	160401	160401	Steve	351	“ We 're like the Mayor — we want the Japanese too scared to come ashore ever again . You provide the men and guns , and four or five of us will guide you up there and fight with you . And we 'll tell you when the landings are going to happen . ”
160462	160469	160470	160470	Jennings	249	“ That 's quite a proposal , ”
160477	160488	160489	160489	Steve	351	“ We 're young , but that does n't matter , "
160492	160503	160470	160470	Jennings	249	“ We can fight — we 'd ambush them good . ”
160504	160511	160512	160512	Jennings	249	“ That 's what we do , ”
160516	160530	160512	160512	Jennings	249	“ We ambush and kill them . We 're talking about killing men . "
160531	160536	160537	160537	Steve	351	" I know that . "
160541	160562	160537	160537	Steve	351	“ Those Japanese are invaders . They 're taking advantage of our weakness . Killing them is defending the country . ”
160563	160567	160568	160568	Jennings	249	“ True enough , ”
160571	160602	160568	160568	Jennings	249	“ Still ... that man down there would n't appreciate us dealing with you behind his back , would he . I do n't know if we should do that . ”
160603	160672	160673	160673	Jennings	249	" He 'll never hear of it . Never know of it . There 's just a few of us , and none of us will say a word . We go up into the ruins at night a lot — they 'll think we 're doing that again when we go with you . Besides , if things go well , they 'll have to join us . "
160680	160687	160675	160675	his	249	" Is that so , Henry ? "
160688	160695	160696	160696	I	0	“ Sure is , Mr. Jennings . ”
160703	160718	160696	160696	I	0	“ We could guide you up there and no one would be the wiser . "
160719	160722	160723	160723	Jennings	249	“ Maybe . ”
160726	160729	160730	160730	He	249	“ Maybe . ”
160742	160756	160730	160730	He	249	“ Do you know right now when a landing party is coming in ? ”
160757	160760	160761	160761	Steve	351	" Soon , ”
160764	160795	160761	160761	Steve	351	“ We know one is coming in soon . We already know where , and we 'll find out exactly when in the next few days , I 'd guess . ”
160796	160909	160730	160730	He	249	“ All right . Tell you what . If you hear of a landing , you THE WILD SHORE 239 come tell us at the weigh station where we stopped working the tracks . We 'll have men there . I 'll go back south and talk to the Mayor , and if he agrees to the idea , which maybe he will , then we 'll bring men up and be ready to move . We got the tracks working again , did I tell you that , Henry ? It was tough , but we did it . Anyway , you know where those buildings are , the weigh station . ”
160910	160916	160917	160917	Nicolin	278	“ We all know that , ”

Mando came out and greeted us . “

Mando led us to the corner room that they called the hospital . Its two outer walls were oil drums ; there were two beds , a stove , an overhead trap door to let sun and air in , and a smooth wood floor . We put Tom on the corner bed . He lay there with a faint frown turning his mouth . We went into the kitchen and let Doc look at him . "

The deeper the question the shallower the answer — until the deepest questions have no answers at all . Why are things the way they are , Kath ? A sigh , arms touching , curled hairs floating across one 's face , the wind , the clouds overhead . What more answer than that ? I felt choked , as if oceans of clouds filled me to bursting . A strand of Kathryn 's hair rolled up and down my nose , and I watched it fiercely , noted its every kink and curl , every streak of red in the brown , as a way to hold myself all in ... as a way to grab the world to me with my senses , to hold it against me so it could n't slip away . .

173344	173378	173339	173339	Steve	351	“ I hope we try whaling again this winter , I think we could make a go of it if we harpooned a small whale . From more than one boat , maybe . ”

173457	173465	173430	173430	I	0	“ No , for God 's sake . ”

173871	173880	173881	173881	Steve	351	“ They catch them up in San Clemente , ”
173884	173914	173881	173881	Steve	351	“ They make a lot of silver off them at the meets , too . Why , one whale is how many jars of oil , did Tom say ? ”

173922	173948	173881	173881	Steve	351	" You do too ! What 's this I do n't know . I tell you . This whole valley is going to the dogs . "

173978	174000	173974	173974	he	278	“ Maybe we could poison the harpoons . Or , you know , harpoon a whale twice , from two boats . "
174001	174017	173881	173881	Steve	351	“ We 'd get all tangled . The boats would be pulled together and crushed . ”
174018	174025	173974	173974	he	278	“ What about poison , then . ”
174026	174060	173974	173974	he	278	" It would be better to put three boats ' worth of line on the end of one harpoon , so we could let the whale run as far down as it liked . "
174061	174070	174071	174071	He	278	“ Now see , there you 're talking . ”
174075	174137	174071	174071	He	278	“ Or how about this , we could have the harpoon at the end of a line that extended right back to the beach - held up by little floats or something . And then when the harpoon struck , the playing of the thing would be from the beach . Eventually we could just haul it right into the rivermouth . ”
174139	174150	173974	173974	he	278	“ The harpoon would have to be pretty well fixed . ”
174151	174166	173974	173974	he	278	“ Well of course . That would be true no matter what you did . ”
174167	174201	173974	173974	he	278	“ I guess . But it 's also a hell of a lot of line you 're talking about . Usually those things are a mile or so offshore , are n't they ? "
174206	174209	174214	174214	he	278	“ Yeah .... "
174217	174231	174214	174214	he	278	“ I wonder how those folks in San Clemente do catch them monsters . ”
174232	174243	173974	173974	he	278	“ You got me . They sure are n't telling . ”
174244	174255	173974	173974	he	278	“ I would n't either , if I was them . "
174256	174284	174285	174285	He	278	“ What 's this ? I thought you were telling me all the towns have to stick together , we 're all one country and all that . "
174288	174313	174285	174285	He	278	“ That 's true . You 've said so yourself . But until everyone agrees to it , you got to protect your advantages . "
174370	174413	174363	174363	Steve	351	“ Remember , now , we 've promised Jennings . And you know you want to go up there and fight those Japs . Remember what they did to you and Tom and the rest of you out there in that storm ? ”

174477	174507	174438	174438	Nicolin	278	“ So , get up there and see what you can do with Melissa . She 's got a feeling for you , she 'll do what you want . "

174512	174521	174438	174438	Nicolin	278	“ Maybe she 'll ask Add for you . "
174522	174527	174438	174438	Nicolin	278	“ I doubt it . ”
174528	174563	174564	174564	I	0	“ Still , you 've got to start somewhere . And I 'll see if I ca n't think of something myself . Maybe we could eavesdrop on them like you did last time . "
174567	174574	174575	174575	I	0	“ It might come to that , ”
174578	174586	174575	174575	I	0	“ I 've thought of that myself . ”
174587	174601	174438	174438	Nicolin	278	“ Okay , but do what else you can first , all right ? ”
174602	174613	174438	174438	Nicolin	278	“ All right . I 'll give her a try . ”
174695	174701	174702	174702	he	287	“ He 's asleep now , ”
174719	174725	174726	174726	he	287	“ He 's getting weaker , ”
174734	174797	174726	174726	he	287	“ I do n't know .... Too bad you guys had such miserable weather coming back from San Diego . You 're young and can take it , but Tom ... Tom acts like he 's young when he should n't . Maybe this will teach him to be more careful , to take better care of himself . If he lives . "
174798	174807	174808	174808	I	0	" You should remember the same thing yourself , "

182473	182484	182422	182422	his	351	" Come by tonight and tell me what they said . ”
182485	182489	182422	182422	his	351	" I will . "
182541	182549	182550	182550	Steve	351	“ Guess who was at their camp ? "

182589	182601	182550	182550	Steve	351	“ Is that right ? What 's he doing up here ? ”
182602	182642	182550	182550	Steve	351	“ He 's here to fight the Japs , of course . He was really happy when I told him we could lead them to a landing . He shook my hand and we drank some whisky and everything . ”
182643	182655	182560	182560	his	351	“ I bet . Did you tell him where it was ? ”
182656	182729	182550	182550	Steve	351	“ Course not ! Do you take me for a fool ? I said we were n't getting the final word till tomorrow , and that we 'd tell them when we were up there ourselves with them . That way they 'll have to take us , see ? In fact , I told them that only you know where they 're landing , and that you would n't tell anyone . ”
182730	182742	182550	182550	Steve	351	“ Oh , fine . Now why should I do that ? ”
182743	182781	182550	182550	Steve	351	“ Because you 're a suspicious kind of guy , naturally , and 284 Kim Stanley Robinson you do n't want the Japanese to find out somehow that we know . That 's what I told them . ”

184128	184162	184075	184075	Tom	351	“ Used to be . But the wind is n't hot because of the desert . It gets compressed coming over the mountains , and that heats it up . Compression heats things . "
184163	184166	184167	184167	I	0	“ Ah . ”
184282	184295	184274	184274	Tom	351	“ Have you gotten started on filling that book I gave you ? ”
184297	184320	184274	184274	Tom	351	“ Oh , Tom , I do n't know how to do such a thing . I have n't even opened it . ”

184387	184435	184383	184383	he	351	“ Spelling does n't matter . The six signatures of Shakespeare we have are spelled four different ways . You remember that when you worry about spelling . And grammar does n't matter either . You just write it down like you would talk it . Understand ? "
184436	184439	184329	184329	he	351	“ But Tom "
184440	184464	184329	184329	he	351	“ Do n't but me , boy . I did n't spend all that time teaching you to read and write for nothing . ”
184465	184499	184500	184500	He	351	“ I know . But I do n't have any stories to write , Tom . You 're the one with the stories . Like that one when you met yourself , remember ? ”
184504	184514	184515	184515	I	0	“ The one where you picked yourself up hitchhiking , ”

184560	184563	184549	184549	his	351	“ Yes . ”
184599	184616	184617	184617	I	0	“ That was an awful long time ago for you to remember it all so clearly , "
184620	184658	184617	184617	I	0	“ What you said and all . There 's no way I could do that . I ca n't even remember what I said last week . That 's another reason I could n't write that book . ”
184659	184664	184665	184665	he	351	“ You write it , ”
184669	184722	184665	184665	he	351	“ Everything comes back when you write it down . Press the memory . He fell silent , and we listened to the wind 's howls . A branch thumped the wall . He clutched at the sheet covering his legs , clutched and twisted it . It had a frayed edge . “
184726	184730	184665	184665	he	351	” I asked . "
184733	184754	184665	184665	he	351	" Still he kneaded it , and looked at the wall across from me . He sighed a few times . “

184845	184899	184836	184836	I	0	” He took a deep breath , held it , let it go . I noticed that he had n't coughed since 288 Kim Stanley Robinson I had arrived , and thought that the dry wind might be a help to him . I was about to remark on that when he said , “
184907	184908	184903	184903	I	0	” “

184928	184959	184923	184923	I	0	" He sighed , shifted around under the sheet . Closed his eyes for a time , so that I thought he might have fallen asleep . Opened them again . “

184984	185001	184967	184967	I	0	” He shifted his gaze and stared at me , his brown eyes shiny and pleading . “
185081	185093	185078	185078	I	0	” He blinked several times in succession , shook his head . "
185098	185109	185078	185078	I	0	” I said in a voice dry as the wind . “
185114	185119	185078	185078	I	0	” he repeated dreamily . “
185155	185213	185145	185145	I	0	” I stared at him , stared at him ; got up and walked around the room , and ended up at the foot of the bed where I stared at him some more . I could n't seem to get him in focus . He stopped meeting my eye and looked uncomfortably at his mottled hands . "
185226	185231	185221	185221	I	0	" he said apologetically . “
185236	185242	185243	185243	You	0	" I asked , stupefied . "

185380	185473	185376	185376	he	0	“ To hold on to the part of our past that 's of value , maybe ? To keep our spirits up . Like that book does . Ca n't be sure if he did it or not . Could be a Glen Baum that did go around the world . Could be Wentworth wrote it right there in his workshop . Does n't matter — it 's happened now because of the book . An American around the world . We needed it even if it was a lie , understand ? ”
185523	185534	185511	185511	I	0	“ So you did n't meet your double after all . ”
185535	185549	185508	185508	I	0	“ No . Made it up . Made a lot of things up . ”
185550	185558	185559	185559	I	0	“ But why , Tom ? Why ? "
185648	185658	185645	185645	he	0	“ Sit down , boy . Sit down here . "
185665	185728	185729	185729	He	0	“ Now listen . I came down and saw it , see ? See ? I was in the mountains , like I said . That part of the story was true . All the lies were true . In the mountains on a hike to myself . I did n't even know the bombs went off , can you believe it ? ”
185756	185879	185745	185745	he	0	“ It was a fine day , I hiked over Pinchot Pass , but that night smoke blotted the stars . No stars . I did n't know but I knew . And I came down and saw it . Every person in Owens Valley was crazy , and the first one I met told me why , and that moment -oh , Hank , thank God you wo n't ever have to live that moment . I went crazy like the rest of them . I was just older than you and all of them were dead , everyone I knew . I was mad with grief and my heart broke and sometimes I think it never did get mended . ... "
185884	185896	185880	185880	He	4906	" Now I see why I do n't talk about it . ”
185919	185933	185916	185916	he	4906	“ But I got to , I got to , I got to , "
185945	185951	185916	185916	he	4906	“ Stop it , Tom . ”
185975	185982	185970	185970	His	4906	“ You do n't have to . "
185983	185987	185988	185988	he	4906	“ Got to , ”
185998	186169	186170	186170	he	4907	" At first I did n't believe it . But the greyhound was n't running and I knew . It took me a work of walking and hitching rides with madmen to get home , but when I came down five it was still burning pillars of smoke everywhere , the whole city . I knew it was true then and I was afraid of the radiation so I did n't go on to see my home . Up into the mountains looting and scavenging for food . How long I do n't know , lost my mind and only really remember flashes like flames through smoke . Killing . I came to in a cabin in the mountains and knew I would have to see it to believe they were all dead . My family , see ? I did n't care about the radiation anymore , do n't think I even remembered it . So I went back to Orange County , and there , oh , oh , ”
186193	186200	186201	186201	he	4907	“ I ca n't tell that , ”
186204	186270	186201	186201	he	4907	“ It was ... evil . I ran and came here . Empty hills , I was sure the whole world was destroyed , world of insects and people dying on the beaches . When I hoped , I thought it might be just us and Russia , Europe and China . That the other countries would get help to us eventually , ha ha . ”
186282	186381	186271	186271	He	4907	“ But no one knew . No one knew anything beyond what they could see . I saw empty hills . That was all I knew . Marines had kept them clear . I saw I could live in these hills without going mad , if I could avoid getting killed by someone or starving . It could be done . See up to that point I did n't know if it could be done . But here was the valley and I knew it could be done . And I never set foot in Orange County again . "
186405	186413	186402	186402	he	4908	“ Never , not to this day . "
186422	186526	186414	186414	He	4908	" It 's evil , evil . You 've seen them at the swap meets , scavengers , there 's something wrong with them , wall - eyed or something burst inside - there 's something wrong in their eyes , you can see it 's driven them crazy to live in those ruins . Insanity 's horse . And no surprise either . You got to stay out of that place , Henry . I know you 've been up there at night . But listen to me , now , do n't go up there , it 's bad , bad . ”
186559	186571	186549	186549	his	4908	" Promise me you wo n't go up there , boy . ”
186572	186576	186549	186549	his	4908	" Ah , Tom- "
186577	186585	186586	186586	he	4908	“ You ca n't go up there , ”
186590	186600	186586	186586	he	4908	“ Tell me you wo n't , not ever . "
186601	186614	186549	186549	his	4908	" Tom , I mean sometime I 'm gon na have to — "
186615	186670	186549	186549	his	4908	“ No ! What for ? You get what you need out of there from scavengers , that 's what they 're for , please , Henry , promise me . There 's evil up there so bad it ca n't be spoken of please I 'm asking you not to go up there — ”
186671	186675	186676	186676	I	0	" All right ! "
186679	186690	186676	186676	I	0	“ I wo n't go up there . I promise . "
186744	186756	186735	186735	He	4908	“ Good . Save you from that . But not me . "
186768	186792	186761	186761	I	0	“ But I guess it did n't harm you , not in the long run . Here you are all these years later . "
186793	186850	186851	186851	He	4908	“ Neutron bombs . Short term radiation . So I guess , but I do n't know . Something like that , though . The earth will revenge us , but it 's no solace . Revenge is no solace . Their suffering wo n't pay off ours , nothing will ever , we were murdered . "
186866	187330	186861	186861	He	4908	“ The ones of us left were so hungry , so hungry , we fought each other and finished the murder off for them , ah , that was the worst of it . So crazy . In the year after more people died than had been killed by the bombs , I 'm sure , and more and more until it looked like every last one of us would die . Civil defense , yeah . Stupid Americans so far from the earth by then that we could n't figure out how to live off it , or those who could were swamped by those who could n't , killed and the fighting was bitter . It got so 's a friend you could trust was worth more than the world to you . Until there were so few left there was no need to fight anymore , no one to fight . All dead . The deaths , Henry . I saw Death walking down the road more times than you 'd care to imagine . Old man in a black coat , axe over his shoulder . Got so I waved to him and walked on by . Then out of the sky the storms , weather turned bad and the storms came . There was a winter that lasted ten years , good limerick . But the suffering was too much to bear . I live to 292 Kim Stanley Robinson show what a person can bear and die not , good poem , remember it ? Did I give you that one ? It got so when you saw a living human face that was n't insane you wanted to hug the person right then and there . Years of solitude like he never thought of . You need people , easier to get food the more of you there are , up to a point . So that when we settled here ... it was a start . New . Were n't more than a dozen of us . Every day a struggle . Food ... I used to wonder what for ... we 're slaves to it , boy , I learned that . Grew up and did n't learn a thing about it , not really . In that America was evil . The world was starving and we ate like pigs , people died of hunger and we ate their dead bodies and licked our chops . It 's true what I say to Emest and George , we were a monster and we were eating up the world and they had reasons to do it to us , but still , still we did n't deserve it . We were a good country . ”
187331	187351	187352	187352	He	4910	“ Please , Tom . You 're going to hurt your voice going on So , you ca n't ! "
187419	187470	187471	187471	he	4910	" We were free then . Not perfectly so , you understand , but it was the best we could do , we were trying , it was the best so far . Nobody else had ever done it better , we ... it was the best country in history , "
187483	187647	187471	187471	he	4910	“ I tell you true now , no baiting George or babbling , with all the flaws and stupidities we were still the leader , the focus of the world , and they killed us for it . Malicious envy they murdered us for , killed the best country the earth ever had , it was genocide boy do you know that word ? Genocide , the murder of a whole people . Oh it had happened before , we did it ourselves to the Indians . Maybe that 's why this happened to us . I keep coming on reasons but they 're not enough . Still it would be better to think that than to think we were killed out of hateful envy of the other countries , we did n't deserve that , no nation could deserve such desolation , we were wrong in a million ways and had flaws big as our strengths but we did n't deserve this . ”
187648	187658	187758	187758	his	4911	“ Calm down , Tom , please calm down . ”
187659	187666	187667	187667	he	4911	“ They 'll suffer for it , "
187670	187756	187667	187667	he	4911	“ Tornadoes , yes , and earthquakes and floods and droughts and fires , and murder for mo good reason . See I went back to see . I had to see . And it THE WILD SHORE 293 was all smoking and blasted flat . Home . And just a few blocks away it still stood , blasted flat all around it but not it , ground zero is that stilt spot . It really was the magic kingdom when I was a child . ”
187792	187999	187780	187780	I	0	“ Main Street was all full of trash , dead people here and there , ruins , the smell of death . Around the corner the steamboat used to come , one time when I was a little boy my folks took me and as the steamboat rounded the corner we could hear that horn cutting across the water like Gabriel 's last call and the whole crowd knew it was him in an instant , Satchmo it was , Henry , Satchmo playing louder than the steamboat whistle , but now the lake was chock with corpses . I went to talk with Abraham Lincoln , leaned my head in his lap looked in his sad eyes and told him they killed his country like they killed him but he knew already and I cried on his shoulder . Went through the castle to the giant teacups , big blowsy woman and two men in the dead silence laughing drunk and trying to get the teacups to spin , she let a big green bottle go smash it went over the concrete and that instant I knew it was all true , and the man — the man he took his knife , oh - oh- ”
188000	188005	187758	187758	his	4911	" Please , Tom ! "
188006	188440	188443	188443	Tom	351	" But I survived ! I survived . Ran from evil I do n't know where or how , came to in the valley like I said . I ran all the way and learned what I had to to survive . Did n't learn a damned thing in the old time . Schoolbook rubbish , nothing more . Idiot America . Roger 's the model of reason next to it , I nearly died learning what I had to know , nearly died twenty times and more , Jesus I was lucky to live , luck boy it 's real and so real it makes the differences between life and death a million times in your life . Just luck . Until it turns up ace of spades I saw that happen to friends right before my eyes and me not able to do a thing but wonder my ace had n't turned up too , it was hard . Sometimes me or them , he fell in the torrent and maybe I could have — or the time they took her , no Troy for us ... harsh , harsh , harsh . Tiger justice , we 're Greek now boy , it 's as hard for us as it was for them , and if we can make something beautiful out of it it 'll be like what they made , that fine carved line pure and simple just to describe it the way it is . And Death fine curve sitting there always , skull under flesh in the sun , no wonder the tragedies , the harshness , verse rituals the vase , the 294 Kim Stanley Robinson curved line , they were just a way of talking about what 's real then and now , real as hunger , a way to take nothing out of the pain , sometimes I ca n't bear to think of it . We were the last of those plays , great pride a great flaw , the two the same and they killed us for it , blasted us to desolation struggling in the dirt to scratch out thirty years and die like Greeks , oh , Henry , can you see why I did it , why I lied to you , it was to keep you knowing it , to keep you from the nothing , to make us Greek ghosts on the land and defying what fell to us and make that something pure and simple so we can say we 're still people , Henry , Henry- “
188452	188503	188504	188504	You	351	" I was standing , holding him by the shoulders , leaning over him , shaking at his delirium . Twisting he started to speak again and I put my hand over his mouth , clamped it there . He struggled to breathe and I let my hand off him . “
188511	188538	188504	188504	You	351	” I told him . The lamp sputtered , our shadows wavered against the black circles of the wall , the wind shrieked around the corner . "

188588	188592	188572	188572	You	351	” he whispered . "
188608	188644	188572	188572	You	351	” He seemed to hear me , finally . He leaned back . I wiped the sweat from my forehead , and sat down again . I felt like I had been running for miles . “

188719	188739	188715	188715	You	351	" He relaxed back into the pillow . Bong , bong , bong , bong , bong , bong . “
188745	188765	188743	188743	Tom	351	” He stopped . The wind picked up again , filling the silence . Whoooo , whooo000 , whooo00000000 . "
188773	188785	188768	188768	I	0	” he said softly , the strain gone from his voice . "

188801	188817	188768	188768	I	0	" I said seriously . I was still scared ; my heart still pumped hard . “

Everything 's so clear given what you 've gone through — the images are there , even sometimes the words to convey them with . But it does n't work . You ca n't teach what the world has taught you . All the tricks of rhetoric , the force of personality , the false authority of being teacher , or pretending to be immensely old ... none of that 's enough to bridge the gap . And nothing else would be either . “
189074	189138	189069	189069	I	0	” He slid down the pillow until he was flat on his back . Snuggled under the sheet , so that it looked like he would fall asleep right then , for his eyes were closed and he was breathing deep , in the way of an exhausted man . But then one brown eye opened and stared at me , pierced me . “
189162	189264	189150	189150	boy	5376	” Part Four ORANGE COUNTY Chapter Nineteen Outside it was dark , and the wind howled . I stood at the log bench in the garden and watched wind tear at the potato tops , felt it tear at me . To the west Cuchillo poked into the last blue before night 's black . It all looked different , as if I had walked out of the drum house into another time , a time when winds blasted the land like bombs . Wind tore my breath from me , shoved it back in . I tried to collect myself . “
189267	189297	189345	189345	he	286	" Steve said sharply , and I jumped . He and Mando and Gabby were behind me . Impossible in the wind to hear anybody come up on you . “
189301	189305	189345	189345	he	286	” I said . “
189310	189314	189315	189315	I	0	" Mando said , “

189387	189391	189357	189357	you	4917	” Steve insisted . “
189402	189508	189509	189509	We	4919	” Without a word Mando took off down the trail , back into the valley . We followed him . In the woods the wind became no more than a gust here and there . Trees creaked , moaned , hummed . Over Basilone we hiked , steering clear of the Shankses ' house . Through the overgrown foundations to the freeway , where we picked up the pace . Quickly enough we were in San Mateo Valley , and past the spot where I had confronted Add . Steve stopped , and we waited for him to decide what to do . He said , “
189522	189523	189509	189509	We	4919	" “
189532	189536	189524	189524	We	4919	” Gabby said . “

189581	189586	189587	189587	They	4920	” I put in . “
189602	189604	189587	189587	They	4920	” - “
189607	189639	189587	189587	They	4920	" We walked close together so we could hear each other in the wind . A ball of tumbleweed bounced across the freeway and Mando shied . Steve and Gabby laughed . “
189646	189673	189587	189587	They	4920	” Gabby observed . Mando did n't answer , but pressed on ahead . We followed him to the San Mateo River . Nobody was there . “
189686	189690	189674	189674	They	4920	” I guessed . “
189709	189710	189705	189705	They	4920	" “
189715	189719	189705	189705	They	4920	” said Steve . “
189725	189746	189705	189705	They	4920	” A bright light flashed on us from below the freeway 's shoulder , and a voice from the trees said “
189751	189785	189705	189705	They	4920	" We squinted into the glare . It reminded me of the Japanese surprising us in the fog at sea , and my heart hammered like it wanted to bound off by itself . “
189790	189798	189705	189705	They	4920	” Steve called . Gabby snickered disgustedly . “
189802	189822	189705	189705	They	4920	" The light went out , leaving me blind . Under the sound of the wind , some rustling . “
189825	189837	189705	189705	They	4920	” A shape loomed on the sea side of the freeway . “
189843	189951	189952	189954	Four of you	4924	" We felt our way down the slope , bumping together in a THE WILD SHORE 301 clump . There were a lot of men around us . When we got to the bottom of the slope we stood in bushes that came to our waists . A dozen or more men surrounded us . One of them bent over and opened the shade on a gas lantern ; most of its light was caught in the lower branches of the brush , but standing in one dim beam in front of the lantern was Timothy Danforth , Mayor of San Diego . His trousers were muddy . “
189959	189991	189994	189994	sir	1218	” he said in his loud bray . His voice brought back every detail of my night at his house on the freeway island , and it was Nicolin who answered , “
189996	190013	189994	189994	sir	1218	” More men joined us , dark shapes coming up through the brush from the river . “
190020	190025	190028	190028	sir	1218	" the Mayor said . “
190030	190034	190028	190028	sir	1218	” Steve said . "
190047	190073	190040	190040	Jennings	453	" One of the men , looking like Jennings now that he had been named , crouched over a large canvas bag on the ground . “
190078	190082	190083	190083	Lee	451	” I asked . “
190092	190096	190083	190083	Lee	451	” Danforth said . “
190113	190114	190108	190108	you	453	” “
190121	190122	190117	190117	someone	5387	” "
190133	190134	190130	190130	Jennings	453	” "
190146	190220	190137	190137	I	0	” Jennings gave a pistol to each of us . Mine was big , and heavy . I crouched and looked at it in the lantern 's light , holding it in both hands . Black metal business end , black plastic handle . It was the first time I had held a gun outside a swap meet . Jennings handed me a leather pouch filled with bullets , and kneeled beside me . “
190245	190285	190242	190242	you	453	" He spun the cylinder to show me where the bullets fit in . The others were getting instructions around me . I straightened and blinked to help my night sight return , hefting the pistol in my hand , "
190295	190296	190297	190297	I	0	” "
190304	190305	190242	190242	you	453	” "
190311	190360	190309	190309	men	5282	" If it were n't for the wind , the Mayor 's voice would be heard all the way back in Onofre , it seemed . He limped over to me , and I had to look up at him . His hair danced over his shadowed face . “
190374	190378	190379	190379	We	4932	” Steve said , “
190390	190391	190379	190379	We	4932	" “
190396	190411	190379	190379	We	4932	" said the Mayor . Steve looked at me . The Mayor went on : “
190440	190457	190458	190458	You	4935	” So , I thought , they had boated up the coast to get past Onofre . “
190499	190509	190510	190510	They	4938	” The circle of men stood around us silently . “
190517	190581	190510	190510	They	4938	” I said . There it was . If they wanted to leave us now , there was nothing we could do about it . We stood watching the Mayor . No one spoke , and I could feel Nicolin 's accusing gaze , but I kept staring into the underlit face of the Mayor , who looked back at me without expression . “
190591	190592	190583	190583	you	4935	” “
190598	190599	190595	190595	I	0	" “
190607	190608	190603	190603	you	4935	" “
190617	190637	190614	190615	the Japanese	300	" Another silence followed that . Danforth looked over at a man I recognized - Ben , his assistant . “
190644	190652	190653	190653	We	4939	” Danforth said after this silent conference . “
190659	190663	190653	190653	We	4939	” Steve said , “
190676	190680	190653	190653	We	4939	” Danforth nodded . “
190688	190689	190653	190653	We	4939	” “
190717	190735	190736	190736	We	4939	” Now that he was sure we were going , Steve 's voice was filled with excitement . "
190746	190750	190736	190736	We	4939	” Danforth said . “
190760	190989	190751	190751	They	653	" We climbed back up the shoulder into the hot dry blast of the wind . Like me , Mando carried a gun in his hand ; Steve and Gab had room in their coat pockets for theirs . When we were all on the roadway the San Diegans started north , and we followed . A few men disappeared ahead and behind us . They had all sorts of guns with them : rifles , pistols as long as my forearm , little fat guns on tripods . Trees swayed on each side of the road , and branches tumbled through the air like injured night birds . The stars winked brightly in the cloudless black sky , and by their light I could see a great deal : shapes in the forest , the whitish slash of the freeway stretching ahead through the trees , the occasional scout jogging back down the road to us , to report to the Mayor . The four of us kept right behind Danforth , and listened silently as he disTHE WILD SHORE 303 cussed things and gave orders in a voice calculated to warn every scavenger in Orange County . Walking down the middle of the road , we topped the rise where brick walls tumbled into the freeway , climbed over them and were in San Clemente itself . “
191000	191025	190990	190990	I	0	” Danforth remarked to Ben , unaware of the boundary we had crossed , the boundary I had promised Tom I would never cross .... "
191070	191115	191061	191061	they	4945	” Nicolin kept right on the Mayor 's heels , soaking in every word . I fell farther and farther back , but I could still hear him when the three men in the rearguard climbed out of the brick tangle and one said , “
191130	191281	191061	191061	they	4945	” I picked up my pace and rejoined the Mayor 's group . Up and down , up and down , over the hills . Trees bounded in place under the wind 's hard hand , and the wires still in the air swung like jumpropes . Eventually we came to the road Nicolin had mentioned , that would lead us through San Clemente to Capistrano Beach and Dana Point . Once off the freeway and down in the rubble - filled streets I was obsessed by thoughts of ambush . Branches flew out from between broken walls , planks slapped each other , tumbleweed ran at us or away from us , and time after time I clicked over the safety of my pistol , ready to dive for cover and shoot . The Mayor highstepped over the junk in the middle of the street easy as you please . “
191288	191307	191061	191061	they	4945	” he shouted to us , aiming with his pistol at a silhouette dodging through the street ahead . “
191318	191357	191061	191061	they	4945	" He gave us the whole strategy of our positions in the street , which seemed like accidents of the moment . The men all had their rifles at the ready , and they were spread out well . “
191373	191384	191368	191368	I	0	” He kicked a brick in the road and stumbled . “
191389	191421	191368	191368	I	0	” It was the third time he had nearly fallen . In all the rubbish it was necessary to watch every step , but he was above that sort of thing . “
191432	191437	191368	191368	I	0	” he asked Steve . “
191445	191446	191368	191368	I	0	” “
191457	191495	191368	191368	I	0	” Steve said , his voice raised to carry over the clatter the wind was making . 304 Kim Stanley Robinson He still sounded weak compared to the Mayor , who was talking in his everyday voice . "
191501	191505	191506	191506	I	0	” Danforth declared . “
191516	191531	191368	191368	I	0	” He called to the forward scouts in a voice that made me wince . “
191537	191542	191368	191368	I	0	" he told them . “
191554	191746	191368	191368	I	0	" We turned up a street headed inland , and intersected the freeway after climbing over a fallen building . Once on the freeway we marched at good speed north , all the way through San Clemente to the big marsh that separates San Clemente from Dana Point . From the south side of the marsh we could see Dana Point clearly . It was a curve of bluffs , not tall like the cliffs down in San Diego , but tall for our part of the coast , and the curve stuck out from the generally straight line of the land . Now it was a dark mass against the stars , not a light on it anywhere . Underneath the sheer part of the bluff was a tangle of marsh and island , trees and ruins , bounded by a rock jetty that protected a narrow strip of water . Once or twice when fishing to the north we had taken refuge there in storms . The jetty was invisible from where we stood , but Steve described it in as much detail as he could to the Mayor . “
191754	191759	191368	191368	I	0	” the Mayor concluded . “
191763	191764	191368	191368	I	0	" “
191789	191790	191368	191368	I	0	” "
191797	191801	191368	191368	I	0	” Steve said . “
191825	191839	191840	191840	I	0	” He said this as proudly as if he were the bridge builder . “
191846	191847	191840	191840	I	0	” "
191860	191972	191975	191975	he	4967	” The road leading from the freeway to the bridge was gone , however , and we were forced to descend a ravine , cross the creek at its bottom , and climb the other side . My pistol was getting to be quite an irritation in all this climbing , and I could see Mando felt the same . Danforth 's exhortations kept us hurrying . Once on the beach road we hurried over the thick sand that covered it , to the mouth of the estuary . As Steve had said , the bridge was still there , in good shape . In a low voice Gabby asked me , “
191980	192266	191975	191975	he	4967	" but all I could do was shrug and shake my head . Nicolin had made night treks on his own , I knew that -- and now I knew that he had come all the way up here , on his own , and had never told me of it . THE WILD SHORE 305 Out on the bridge we caught the full brunt of the wind for the first time since we had entered San Clemente . It peeled over the bridge with a force that made us stagger to walk forward , and it shoved the water of the river in choppy waves against the pilings . The waves burst into foam and rebounded into the channel , to be carried out to sea gurgling and sucking and hissing . We did n't tarry there , and were quickly over the bridge and under the bluffs of Dana Point , out of the wind 's full power . Tucked under the bluffs was the marshy flat that had once been the harbor . Only the channel directly behind the rock jetty was free of the sand and scrub that had drifted in and covered the rest of the little bay . We struggled through nettles and manhigh brush to the beach facing the jetty , less than a stone 's throw away from it . Swells broke over submerged sections of the line of rocks , giving it a white edging and making it visible in the starlight . Weak remnants of the swell washed up and back the pebbly beach . The jetty ended almost directly across from us ; we stood at the entrance of what remained of the harbor . “
192281	192288	192271	192271	they	4968	” Jennings said to the Mayor . “
192299	192319	192291	192291	they	4968	" the Mayor said , pointing up the channel to where it ended against the curve of the bluff . “
192353	192376	192338	192338	they	4968	” Jennings pointed back the way we had come , at the wide beach stretching from the harbor south to the bridge . “
192388	192392	192395	192395	they	4968	” said Ben . “
192402	192406	192407	192407	they	4968	” Jennings said , "

192542	192549	192524	192524	We	4973	” Ben said . Danforth nodded . “
192558	192594	192595	192595	We	4973	” Everyone heard him , of course , and we tramped back through the thick shrubs cursing and struggling . Back on the road that led to the bridge , the Mayor called us together . “
192703	192714	192726	192727	Main force	4983	” He led us from the road onto the beach . “
192735	192757	192726	192727	Main force	4983	” Several men followed his pointing finger , and walked over to a low tumbled - down wall of broken brick . “
192764	192772	192773	192779	Another group in that clump of trees	4984	” He walked south down the beach . “
192793	192812	192789	192789	you	4984	” He came back north , passed the first wall , came to a pile of cement blocks . “
192852	192881	192844	192844	you	4984	” Mando and I put down our guns , and we climbed into the blocks and weeds and tossed some blocks out to make more room for us . “
192886	192890	192844	192844	you	4984	” Danforth said . “
192936	192974	192844	192844	you	4984	" We climbed over the junk in the doorway and stood inside . Two of the walls did n't meet anymore , and we had a good view through the crack of the beach and the water . “
192989	192990	192982	192982	you	4984	" “
192998	193007	192982	192982	you	4984	” Steve said , looking through the crack . “
193047	193081	193029	193029	They	5290	” The rest of the San Diegans had disappeared in their various blinds . The Mayor looked around and saw they had dispersed ; he checked the watch on his wrist and said , “
193204	193205	193201	193201	I	0	” “
193208	193212	193201	193201	I	0	" Steve said . “
193217	193218	193201	193201	I	0	" “
193241	193266	193236	193237	one man	4997	” He shook each of our hands in turn , leaning into the latrine to do it . Once again he crushed my hand . “
193290	193296	193298	193298	our	4988	then”-clenching a fist and swinging it overhead—“now
193304	193340	193341	193341	I	0	" Then he was off , limping across the soft sand to the broken wall down the beach . No one in sight . Steve stood at the big crack facing the water and said , “
193348	193548	193341	193341	I	0	” We each slid into the best seat we could make , and began to wait . Gabby settled down on a pile of disintegrating cement blocks . Mando and I got as comfortable as we could , sitting on each side of him . There was nothing to do but listen to the wind batter the ruins . Once I stood and looked over Steve 's shoulder at the slice of the sea visible through the crack . Waves broke and sluiced up and down the beach ; the offshore wind threw a little spray back , in white arcs barely lit by the starpied sky . Whitecaps flecked the surface farther out to sea . Nothing else . I sat back down . Counted the bullets in my leather pouch . There were twelve of them . The gun was loaded , so theoretically I could kill eighteen Japanese . I wondered how many there would be . With my fingernails I could pluck the loaded bullets from their chambers and slip them back in , so I figured reloading would n't be a problem . Mando saw me and began fiddling with his gun , too . “
193557	193561	193550	193550	you	5001	” he said . “
193568	193656	193563	193563	you	5001	” said Gabby . We waited some more . Leaning back against the cement wall I even dozed a bit , but I had one of those waking dreams , a quick vision of a green bottle tumbling my way , and I jerked awake again , my heart pumping . Still , nothing was happening , 308 Kim Stanley Robinson and I almost drifted off again , thinking in a disconnected dreamy way about the bricks of the latrine . Who had made such onceperfect bricks ? “
193664	193668	193657	193657	I	0	” Mando said . “
193671	193675	193657	193657	I	0	” Steve said . “
193687	193771	193772	193772	scavengers	653	” If they come at all , I thought . Overhead the stars flickered in the velvet black sky . I shifted to the other side of my butt . We waited . Off on the bluffs a pair of coyotes matched yowls . A lot of time passed , heartbeat by heartbeat , breath by breath . Nothing slower than time passing , sometimes . Steve jerked and reached a hand back to snap in our faces . He leaned over , hissed “
193773	194090	194091	194091	I	0	" in a whisper . We jumped to our feet and looked through the crack , peering around Steve . Dark . Then against the white gleam of the shorebreak I made out figures moving down the beach . They stopped for a while near the wall where the San Diegans were hidden , then moved north , until they were between us and the water . Their voices were almost loud enough to be understood . They clumped together and then moved south again , stopping before they had come even with the San Diegans . One of them leaned down and struck a lighter near the sand , and by its tiny flame several pants legs were illuminated . They were dressed in their finery : in the little circle of light were flashes of gold , ruby , sky - blue cloth . The man with the lighter lit five or six lanterns and left them on the sand with several dark bags and a couple of boxes . One of the lanterns had green glass . Another scavenger took that one and a clear one , went to the water and swung them overhead , crossing them once or twice . By the lanterns ' light we could make out parts of the whole crew , silver flashing from their ears and hands , wrists and waists . Several more appeared , carrying dry brush and some bigger branches , and with difficulty they started a fire . Once it was going the kindling burst into flame , and the bigger pieces crackled and spit burning pitch into the sand . Now in the bouncing light they were all clearly visible : fifteen of them , I counted , dressed in yellow and red and purple and blue and green , and weighted down with rings and necklaces of silver and copper . “
194100	194104	194091	194091	I	0	” Steve whispered . “
194119	194120	194109	194109	they	5006	” "
194124	194128	194109	194109	they	5006	” Mando whispered . “
194138	194139	194109	194109	they	5006	” "
194142	194150	194109	194109	they	5006	” Steve hissed . THE WILD SHORE 309 “
194153	194205	194109	194109	they	5006	" said Gabby in an urgent whisper . He pointed past Steve 's shoulder , but already I saw what he meant : there was a dark bulk rising out of the water , just off the end of the jetty . Waves rolled over this dark shape , defining it . “
194215	194220	194109	194109	they	5006	" Gabby said tightly . "
194229	194230	194109	194109	they	5006	” “
194234	194245	194109	194109	they	5006	” Steve said , and we crouched at his sides . "
194251	194285	194109	194109	they	5006	" The man on the beach waved one lantern overhead now , the green one . Their fire gusted in the wind and the bright light bounced off yellow coats , emerald pants . “
194297	194301	194302	194302	They	5010	” Gabby said . “
194307	194316	194302	194302	They	5010	” Steve agreed , awe in his voice . “
194326	194330	194318	194318	you	5012	" Mando said . “
194333	194514	194318	194318	you	5012	" Steve hissed again . One of the submarine 's lights came on , illuminating a narrow black deck . Figures came out of a hatch onto this deck , and in the water beside it they inflated big rafts . Others piled out of the submarine into the rafts . The scavengers ' firelight reflected off the oars as the rafts were rowed to the beach . Two scavengers welcomed the raft by wading into the water up to their waists , and pulling it up the beach beyond the white wavefoam . Several men jumped out of the raft , and a couple more of them lifted packages and wooden boxes out of it . Scavengers handed them jars of amber liquid that glistened in the firelight , and as the Japanese visitors drank we could just hear the scavengers ' greetings , raucous and jovial . The Japanese all looked very round , as if they were wearing two coats each . One of them looked just like my captain . I pulled back from the crack . “
194527	194532	194515	194515	We	5014	” I told Steve . "
194548	194552	194553	194553	We	5014	” I said , “
194584	194585	194586	194586	They	5015	" “
194604	194605	194606	194606	I	0	" "
194618	195024	194611	194611	We	5014	" One more raft was filled , rowed to shore , pulled up the beach . The thick Japanese men stepped out , looked around . The light on the submarine went out , but its dark bulk remained . Boxes were lifted out of the last raft , and some of the scavengers 310 Kim Stanley Robinson gathered around the boxes as they were pried open . One in a scarlet coat held up a rifle from a box for his fellows to see . Crack ! crack ! crack ! The San Diegans opened fire . Shot after shot rang out . From my crouch , looking past Steve 's leg , I could see only the response of our victims on the beach : They fell to the sand , the lanters were out in an instant , the fire knocked to sparks . From then on I could n't see much , but already spits of flame showed they were firing back . I aimed to fire , and at the same moment there was a flat whoosh - BOOM , and we were in a cloud of oily gas , coughing and choking , gasping , crying - my eyes burned so badly I could n't think of anything else - I feared the gas was eating them out of my head . As the wind swept the cloud out to sea there was another boom , and another , and the popping sound of our ambush was overwhelmed by tremendous long bursts of gunfire spraying off the beach . Through eyes burning with tears all I saw was the whitish flame spurting from the Japanese guns . I coughed and spit , feeling sick , raised my gun to shoot it for the first time ( Steve was already shooting ) . I pulled the trigger and my gun went click , click , click . A searchlight speared the darkness , originating on the submarine and lighting somewhere south of us , near the wall hiding the San Diegans . The whole area down there exploded . Gunfire ran in the street behind us , and another cloud of poison gas mushroomed over the beach . The Japanese and the scavengers trapped on the beach stood and marched toward us through the gas , wearing helmets and firing machine guns . Blocks of our latrine fell on us . “
195032	195184	194611	194611	We	5014	” Steve cried . We leaped over the latrine 's back wall and ran for the trees backing the beach . Once on the trash - blocked street flanking the strand , we ran - hopped , rather - struggled over piles of soggy wood and old brick , tripped and fell , got up again . My nose was streaming snot from the poison gas ; I threw away my pistol . In an eyeblink the whole area was bright as day , bright with a harsh blue glare , the shadows solid as rocks . In the sky over us a flare was sputtering light , revealing the tiny parachute holding it up . The whole unit quickly tumbled off to sea , lighting the harbor so that for an instant between trees I could see the submarine , and men on it firing a mounted gun at us . “
195188	195193	194611	194611	We	5014	" Steve was shouting . "
195197	195449	195451	195451	you	5019	" I read his lips more than heard him . It was astounding how loud the gunfire was , I wanted to collapse and clamp my hands over THE WILD SHORE 311 my ears . We scrambled over rubbish , fallen trees , driftwood from storm tides ; Mando caught his foot and we pulled him loose . Bullets whanged over us , tearing the air zip , zip , and I ran hunched down so far my back hurt . Another flare burst into life , higher and farther inland . It floated over us like a falling star , making our way plain but also showing us to everyone so we had to crawl , foot by foot . Rips of machine gun fire came from the sea side of us , and behind us were explosions at frequent intervals : with a blinding flash and a crack to break the ears a building down the street fell all over the rubble . The submarine . We got up from a tangle of planks and ran again , crouched over . Another flare lit the sky above . We fell and waited for the wind to take it to sea . A wrecked building up the hill exploded , then a trio of redwood trees were knocked down . The flare blew away and we stumbled through the shadows for a good way before another flare burst into life , and we lay flat in a copse of eucalyptus . “
195454	195458	195451	195451	you	5019	” Gabby gasped . “
195466	195598	195460	195462	the San Diegans	345	" No one answered . Mando was still carrying his pistol . We were just a ways from the bridge , and I wanted to get over it before the submarine blasted it into the river . Dana Point still rang with gunfire , it sounded like a real battle was going on , but they could have been fighting shadows . I was n't sure the San Diegans would have run like we had . We got up again and scurried over the trash in the streets . A waft of the poison gas . Another fire sparked , but this one plunged fizzing into the marsh . I fell and cut my hand and elbow and knee . We made it to the bridge . No one was there . “
195607	195611	195605	195605	them	5021	” Steve shouted . "
195615	195619	195620	195620	They	5021	” I said . “
195633	195635	195636	195636	They	5021	” . “
195640	195645	195646	195646	They	5021	” Gabby said bitterly . “
195668	195738	195654	195654	They	5021	” Steve stared at Gab open - mouthed . Another flare burst right above us and I crouched by the rail . Looking between the concrete rail posts I saw several of the flares tailing out to sea , making a ragged string that fell closer to the water , until the ones farthest out lit patches of water . The latest one sailed offshore and over the submarine . “
195747	195927	195741	195741	they	5021	” Gabby said furiously . 312 Kim Stanley Robinson He stood and ran across the bridge without waiting for us to agree . We followed him , but another flare sparked the sky , lighting the bridge in ghastly detail . There was nothing to do but keep running , and run we did , because the submarine commenced shooting at us . The railing clanged and the air ripped like stiff cloth , like the first tearing sound of thunder . We got to the far side of the bridge and threw ourselves flat behind a stretch of canted asphalt . The submarine pummeled the bridge . From the hills inland a siren howled , low at first and then rising fast . Scavengers , sounding the alarm . But who were they fighting ? Darkness , distant explosions , siren howls . The submarine stopped firing but my head rang so I could n't hear . Little bangs ahead of us in San Clemente , felt more than heard . Steve put his face to my ear . “
195933	196062	195741	195741	they	5021	” and something I did n't catch . The shooting to the south meant the San Diegans were already down there , I decided , and I cursed them for leaving us . We ran again , but the submarine must have seen us through its night glasses , because it fired again . Down we went . Crawled and hopped , ran doubled over through the ruins on the coastal road . The submarine stayed in the rivermouth , pounding away . We got off the coastal road , back against a low cliff , through trees and on another road . Into the wreck of San Clemente , the maze of trash . Mando was falling behind , limping . I thought it was his foot . “
196066	196079	195741	195741	they	5021	" Steve screamed . Mando shook his head , limped to us . “
196083	196087	196088	196088	They	5023	” he said . "
196092	196131	196088	196088	They	5023	” We stopped and sat him down in the dirt . He was crying , he had his left hand up to his right shoulder . I lifted his hand away and felt the blood run over mine . “
196139	196143	196135	196135	you	5024	” Steve cried . “
196148	196166	196135	196135	you	5024	” Gabby said roughly , and pushed me away . He put his arm around Mando 's . “
196182	196219	196170	196170	we	5024	” By the distant light of the last flare I could make out Mando 's face . He was staring at me as if he had something to tell me , but his mouth only jerked . “
196225	196273	196170	196170	we	5024	" Gabby rasped , his voice cracking . I could feel the blood soaking the back of his shirt . Steve picked up his pistol and we were off . We could only take several steps at a time before some beam or collapsed wall stopped us . “
196282	196375	196274	196274	We	5024	" I finally dared to say . It was running inside my sleeve and down my arm . We put him down and I ripped my shirt into strips . It THE WILD SHORE 313 was hard getting the compress tight over the bullet hole . By accident I brushed the wound with my fingers : a little tear under the shoulderblade , on his right side . It was n't bleeding fast . Mando still stared at my face with a look I could n't read . He did n't speak . “
196385	196598	196376	196376	We	5024	" I said hoarsely . I stood up too fast and staggered , but Steve helped us get him up , and we were off again . The center of San Clemente is one big ruin , no plan or pattern to it , no clear way through . Gabby and I carried Mando between us and struggled along , while Steve ranged forward pistol in hand to find the best way . Sirens cut through the wind 's shrieking from time to time , and we had to hide more than once to avoid roving bands of scavengers : Gunshots echoed . in the clogged streets . I had no idea who was firing at who . A wall fell in the wind . We hiked into dead ends more than once . Steve yelled instructions back to us but sometimes Gabby and I just picked the easiest way ; this caused Steve to yell more , in a high desperate shout . Calls came from behind us and Gabby and I lowered Mando to the ground , stuck in the middle of the street . Three scavengers approached us , guns in hand . Steve ran up and fired , crack crack crack crack ! All the scavengers went down . “
196602	196666	196376	196376	We	5024	” Steve screamed . We picked Mando up and staggered on . Dead ends made us backtrack and after a long time trying to find a way we caught up to Steve sitting in the road , houses collapsed all around us , wind and gunfire beyond , no way forward - our way blocked by a giant mare 's nest of bones . “
196675	196679	196680	196680	I	0	” Steve cried ; "
196687	196727	196680	196680	I	0	” I prodded him to take my side carrying Mando , grabbed his gun and ran across the street . Through trees I saw the ocean , the only mark we really needed when it came down to it . “
196731	196872	196680	196680	I	0	" I called , and hopped over a beam , dragged it out of their path , ran down and got another fix on the sea , picked a road , did what I could to clear it . That went on and on , till it seemed like San Clemente had stretched out all the way down Pendleton . And scavengers on the prowl , setting off their sirens and guns , howling with glee at the hunt . They put us to ground more than once ; I did n't dare shoot at them because I was n't sure how many they were or how many bullets were left in Steve 's gun , if any . While we cowered in the dark of our cover I did what I could for Mando . His breath was choked . “
196883	197047	196877	196881	314 Kim Stanley Robinson Mando	485	" No answer . Steve cursed and cursed . I nodded to Gabby and we got Mando up again . I left Steve to carry him and went out scouting . Scavengers gone , at least out of sight , that was all I wanted . I set to finding a way again . Somehow we got to the southern end of San Clemente , down in the forest below the freeway . Scavengers were roaming the freeway ; we heard their shouts and occasionally I saw their shapes . The only way across San Mateo River was the freeway . We were trapped . Sirens mocked us , gunshots might have marked a skirmish with the San Diegans , although I suspected Gabby was right and they were long gone , on their boats and under way . They would n't be back to help us . Gabby had Mando resting on his lap . Mando 's breath gurgled in his throat . “
197055	197080	196877	196881	314 Kim Stanley Robinson Mando	485	” Gab said , looking at me . I took the bullets from my pocket and tried to fit them into Steve 's gun . “
197086	197142	197083	197083	your	5031	" Steve said . The bullets did n't fit . I cursed and threw the pouch at the freeway . In the dirt we sat on was a rock I could just fit my hand around . I hefted it and started for the freeway . I do n't know what I had in mind . “
197161	197166	197167	197167	You	5033	” I told them . “
197175	197257	197258	197258	Rafael	292	” But a series of explosions blasted the freeway above us , and when they ended ( burnt powder smell blown by ) it was quiet . Not a scavenger to be heard . The silence was broken by the sound of a vehicle coming up the freeway from the south . A little whirrr . I crawled up the shoulder of the road to take a look at it . I jumped out of the road to wave at him . “
197265	197287	197288	197288	Christ	486	” I screamed , the words tearing out of me like no others ever had . Rafael rolled up to me . “
197299	197329	197292	197292	I	0	” He was in the little golf cart that sat in his front yard , the one he swore he could make work if he ever found the batteries . “
197334	197338	197292	197292	I	0	” I said . “
197348	197366	197343	197343	He	485	" Gabby and Steve appeared , carrying Mando between them . Rafael sucked air between his teeth . “
197372	197521	197343	197343	He	485	” Scattered shots rang out from up the freeway , and one spanged off the concrete near us . Rafael reached into his cart and pulled out a metal tube , held by struts at an angle on a flat base . He put it on the road and dropped a hand - sized bomb or grenade ( it looked like a firecracker ) in it . Thonk , the tube said hollowly , THE WILD SHORE 315 and a few seconds later there was an explosion just off the freeway , about where the shots had come from . While Gabby and Steve got Mando in the cart Rafael kept dropping grenades in , thonk , BOOM , thonk , BOOM , and pretty soon no one was firing at us . With a final burst of three he jumped in the cart and we were off . “
197532	197536	197343	197343	He	485	” Rafael said . “
197559	197566	197546	197546	Nicolin	278	” He handed Steve a rifle . “
197572	197584	197546	197546	Nicolin	278	” Steve said . Rafael gestured at the floor beside him . “
197590	197698	197343	197343	He	485	” We hit the steep hill at the very south end of San Clemente , and pushed the cart up it at a slow run . Sirens wailed off the hills ; I could make out three different ones , wavering at different levels as the wind tore at their sound . We made the rise and rolled into the San Mateo Valley . I cradled Mando 's head and told him we were close to home . There were faint shouts behind us , but now we were moving faster than men on foot could . We reached the rise to Basilone Ridge and Rafael said , “
197702	197730	197343	197343	He	485	” He was calm , but when he looked at me his eye was hard . When we reached the top of Basilone rise Steve cried wildly , “
197740	197761	197343	197343	He	485	" and he was off in the dark , back up the freeway to the north , rifle in hand . “
197764	197774	197343	197343	He	485	" I shouted , but Rafael struck my arm . “
197779	197949	197343	197343	He	485	” For the first time he sounded angry . He drove the cart to his house and jumped out , ran inside and came back out with a stretcher . We got Mando on it . His eyes were still open , but he did n't hear me . Blood trickled from the corner of his mouth . Gabby was huffing beside the stretcher as Rafael and I carried him . We struck out through the forest , traversing the side of Cuchillo to get to the Costas ' as fast as possible . I stumbled and groaned , and Gabby took over my end when he saw I could n't see my way . We got to the Costas ' place but I could n't stop crying . Wind whistled over the oil drums ; there was no way they could have heard us approach . Rafael propped the stretcher against his thigh , banged the door like he was out to break it . Wham . Wham . “
197956	197965	197954	197954	Ernest	322	” he said , still banging the door . “
197974	198260	197954	197954	Ernest	322	” Chapter Twenty It must have been something Doc had imagined many times before , the moment when they came to the door and it was his own son hurt and in need of his care . When he pulled the door away from Rafael 's banging he did n't say a word to us ; he came out and picked Mando up off the stretcher and carried him through the kitchen into the hospital without a glance or a question for us . We followed him . In the hospital he laid Mando on the second bed , a small one , and pulled it out from the wall . At the scraping Tom snorted , rolled over . One of his closed eyes opened a crack , and when he caught sight of us he sat up , ground his knuckles in his eyes , surveyed the scene wordlessly . Doc used scissors to cut off Mando 's coat and shirt , gesturing for Gabby to pull off his pants . Gabby squinted as they peeled away the bloody cloth of the shirt . Mando coughed , gargled , breathed fast and shallow . Under the bright lamps Rafael carried in from the kitchen his body looked pale and mottled . Below his armpit was that little tear , surrounded by a bruise . Rafael nearly tripped over me walking in and out . I sat on my 317 318 Kim Stanley Robinson heels against the wall , knees in my armpits , arms wrapped around my legs , rocking back and forth , licking the snot off my lip , looking away from Tom . Doc looked at no one but Mando . “
198265	198280	198262	198262	Kathryn	293	" he said . Gabby glanced at me , hurried out . Tom said , “
198285	198314	198315	198316	Middle caliber	5039	” Doc felt Mando 's ribs carefully , tapped his chest , took his pulse at wrist and neck . He muttered , more to himself than Tom , "
198325	198414	197954	197954	Ernest	322	" Like a spell . He cleaned the blood from Mando 's ribs with a wet cloth . Mando choked and Doc adjusted his head , reached in his mouth and pulled his tongue around . A plastic thing from the supply shelf behind Doc served to clamp the tongue in place . Plastic vise on the side of Mando 's face , stretching his mouth open ... my spine rolled up and down the oil drum behind me . The wind picked up , wheeeeee , wheeeeeee . “
198419	198438	198439	198439	He	278	" Tom asked me . I kept my eyes on the floor . Rafael answered from the kitchen : “
198450	198464	198439	198439	He	278	” Tom was shifting around against his back wall , and he coughed . “
198468	198638	198439	198439	He	278	” Doc said . A flying branch knocked the house sharply . Mando 's breathing was rapid , harsh , shallow . Doc tilted his face to the side and wiped bright blood from his mouth . Doc 's own mouth was a tight lipless line . Bright blood on cloth . Under me the floor , the grainy smooth boards of the floor . Knots raised above the worn surface , cracks , splinters all shiny and distinct in the lamplight , scrubbing sand in the corners against the walls . The bedpost closest to me was shimmied . The sheets were so old that each thread of the fabric stood out ; needlework in the patches . I stared at that floor and never raised my eyes . My breath hurt so it might have been me shot . But it was n't . It was n't . Kathryn 's legs walked into the room , bending down the floorboards a bit . Gabby 's legs followed . “
198643	198647	198639	198639	I	0	” Doc said . “
198652	198657	198648	198648	I	0	” said Kathryn calmly . “
198695	198712	198713	198713	I	0	" She left , came back . Their feet faced each other under Mando 's bed . “
198755	198933	198746	198746	I	0	” I put my hands over my ears . No sounds . No sight but silvery wood planks . Nothing real but wood . ... But no . Muffled coughs from the old man . A quick glance up : Kathryn 's back , in sweatshirt and string - tie pants ; the old man , watching them with an unflinching gaze . Down on the floor went the jar , clear plastic tube stuck in the water at the bottom of it . Suddenly the water bubbled . Blood ran down the sides of the tube and stained the water . More bubbles . The old man 's steady gaze : I wrapped my arms over my stomach and looked up . Kathryn 's broad back blocked my view of Mando . Shudders rattled me . Broad shoulders , broad butt , thick thighs , slim ankles . Elbows busy as she pulled tape from a roll and applied it to Mando , where I could n't see . She looked at me over her shoulder . “
198938	198939	198936	198936	Steve	351	” “
198943	198968	198936	198936	Steve	351	” She grimaced , turned to the work at hand . Tom coughed again , lightly but several times . Doc looked at him . “
198974	198979	198969	198969	You	5044	” he said harshly . "
198991	199030	198989	198989	me	0	” Doc was already back at it . He leaned over Mando with a desperate look in his eye , as if the skills his father had taught him so long ago were not enough for this one . “
199035	199053	198936	198936	Steve	351	” He tapped Mando 's chest and the sound was flat . Mando 's breathing was faster . “
199060	199080	198936	198936	Steve	351	” Doc said . The wind gusted till I could n't make out their voices over the house whistling . “
199091	199137	198936	198936	Steve	351	" Tom asked Gabby what had happened , and Gab explained in a sentence or two . Tom did n't comment on it . The wind dropped again and I could hear the snip of Doc 's scissors . He wiped sweat from his forehead . “
199158	199159	198936	198936	Steve	351	” “
199162	199211	198936	198936	Steve	351	” Something in the way she said it made Doc wince , and look at Tom with a bitter smile . Tom smiled back but then he looked away , eyes filling with tears . I felt a hand on my shoulder and looked up to see Rafael . “
199233	199243	199225	199225	You	284	” 320 Kim Stanley Robinson I shook my head . "
199249	199298	199247	199247	Henry	284	" I shrugged off his hand and buried my face in the crook of my arm . When Rafael was gone I looked up again . Tom was chewing on a curl of his hair , watching them intently . Kathryn put her head to Mando 's chest . “
199304	199316	199299	199299	His	5047	" Mando jerked on the bed . His feet were blue . “
199321	199331	199299	199299	His	5047	" Doc said , voice dry as the wind . “
199336	199349	199350	199350	I	0	" He drew back , his fist clenched up by his neck . “
199363	199368	199356	199356	I	0	” Mando stopped breathing . "
199371	199390	199356	199356	I	0	” Doc said , and with Kathryn 's help he shifted Mando from his side to his back . “
199395	199436	199437	199437	Henry	284	” he said , and put his mouth and hands to Mando 's mouth . He breathed in , holding Mando 's nostrils shut , then straightened up and pressed hard on Mando 's chest . Mando 's body spasmed . “
199444	199586	199437	199437	Henry	284	” Kathryn said sharply . I got up stiffly and held Mando by the shins , felt them twitch , struggle , tense up , slacken . Go slack . Doc breathed into him , breathed into him , pushed his chest till the pushes were nearly blows . Blood ran down the tubes . Doc stopped . We stared at him : eyes closed , mouth open . No breath . Kathryn held his wrist , feeling for a pulse . Gabby and Rafael were in the doorway . Finally Kathryn reached across Mando and put her hand on Doc 's arm ; we had all been standing there a long time . Doc put his elbows on the bed , lowered his ear onto Mando 's chest . His head rolled till it was his forehead resting on Mando . “
199591	199742	199587	199587	He	5048	” he whispered . Mando 's calves were still in my hands , the very muscles that had just been twitching . I let go , scared to be touching him . But it was Mando , it was Armando Costa . His face was white ; it looked like the pinched face of a sick brother of Mando 's , not like the face of the boy I knew . But it was him . Kathryn got out a sheet from the cupboard against the wall and spread it over him , pushing Doc gently away so she could do it . Her sweatshirt was sweaty , bloodstained . She covered Mando 's face . I recalled the expression his face had had when I was carrying him through San Clemente . Even that was preferable to this . Kathryn rounded the bed and pulled Doc to the door . “
199749	199754	199587	199587	He	5048	” Doc said intently . “
199764	199777	199778	199778	I	0	” Kathryn and Rafael tried to calm him but he was insistent . “
199807	199812	199801	199801	I	0	” Tom coughed harshly . “
199843	199845	199846	199846	We	5050	” . “
199852	199857	199858	199858	I	0	" Doc cried petulantly . "
199864	199865	199858	199858	I	0	” “
199906	199915	199858	199858	I	0	” Doc rubbed his face in both hands . “
199926	199932	199933	199933	Gabby	279	" Rafael held him back . “
199940	199944	199935	199935	I	0	” he said . “
199952	199958	199959	199959	I	0	" Doc shook his head . “
199971	199980	199969	199969	Rafe	292	” Rafael looked to Tom , then said , “
199991	200379	199987	199987	us	5050	” He and Gabby got Doc into his coat and shoes , and bumped through the doorway after him . I offered to go but they saw I was useless and told me to stay . From the front door I watched them walk down the path to the river . Predawn twilight , Gabby and Rafael on each side of Doc , holding him . Three little figures under the trees . When they were out of sight I turned around . Kathryn was at the kitchen table , crying . I went outside and sat in the garden . The wind was dying down a bit with the coming of day . It only hit hard in gusts . The light grew ; I could make out gray branches waving . Under the pale sky all distances seemed equal . swelled across the treetops out to sea . The dome of the sky grew lighter and taller , lighter and taller . Grays took on color , colors seeped into the grays , and then the sun , leaf green and blinding , cracked the horizon . Wind gusted . I sat in the dirt . My knee , elbow , and hands throbbed where I had cut them falling . It was impossible that Mando was dead , and that reassured me for long stretches of time . Then my hands felt his calves go slack . Or I heard Kathryn inside , clearing up - and I knew that impossible or not , it was real . But it was n't a thought I could grasp for long . The sun was more than a hand 's breadth over the hills when Doc and Gabby came back up the path , Marvin and Nat Eggloff behind them . Rafael was down the river path , pounding on doors and waking folks up . Gabby fairly staggered up the last 322 Kim Stanley Robinson part of the path . His eyes were ringed red , and he was dirty , as were Doc and Nat . Doc looked up from the path at his house , stopped and waited . Marvin nodded to me and they went inside . I heard them talking with Kathryn . Then she started yelling at the old man . “
200395	200937	200389	200389	We	5057	" Tom must have said his goodbyes to Mando inside . They came out with Mando on Rafael 's stretcher , wrapped in the sheet . Unsteadily I stood . Everyone took a stretcher pole in hand , three on a side . We carried him down to the river , across the bridge . Sun brutal off the water . We took the river path through the trees . People given the news by Rafael caught up with us , family by family , looked shocked , or tearful , or withdrawn . Once looking back I saw John Nicolin leading all the rest of the Nicolins bar Marie and the babies , his face puffy with displeasure . My pa came to my side and put his arm around my shoulder . When he saw my face he squeezed my shoulders hard . For once he did n't look stupid to me . Oh he still had that vague look of someone who does n't quite get it . But he knew . Suffering you do n't have to be smart to understand . With the knowledge in his eyes was mild reproach , and I could n't look at him . Back in the neck of the valley we were in the shade . Carmen met us outside her home and led us to the graveyard . She was wearing her preaching robe and carrying the Bible . In the graveyard was a new hole in the ground , a mound of fresh earth on one side of it , Mando 's mother Elizabeth 's grave on the other . We laid the stretcher on her grave and all the people trailing us circled around . Most of the valley 's people were there . Nat and Rafael lifted Mando 's body and the sheet into a coffin twice Mando 's size . Nat held the lid in place while Rafael nailed it down . Whap , whap , whap , whap . Sunbeams filtered through the branches . Doc watched the nails being driven home with a desolate look . Both his wife and Mando had been so much younger than him , their years did n't add up to half his . When the coffin was nailed shut John stepped forward and helped them arrange the ropes under the coffin . He and Rafael and Nat and my pa picked up the ropes and lifted the coffin over the hole . They lowered it to John 's curt , quiet instructions . When it was settled in the hole they pulled the ropes up . John gathered them and gave them to Nat , his jaw muscles so tight it looked like he had pebbles in his mouth . THE WILD SHORE 323 Carmen stepped to the edge of the grave . She read some from the Bible . I watched a sunbeam twisting through the trees . She told us to pray , and in the prayer she said something about Mando , about how good he had been . I opened my eyes and Gabby was staring at me from across the grave , accusing , terrified . I squeezed my eyes shut again . “
200946	201251	200941	200941	we	5059	” She took a clod of dirt and held it over the grave ; held a tiny silver cross over it with the other hand . She dropped them both in . Rafael and John shoveled the damp earth into the hole , it made the hollow sound . Mando was still down there and I almost cried out for them to stop it , to get him out . Then I thought , it could have been me in that grave , and an awful terror filled me . The bullet that struck Mando had been one of swarms of them ; that one or any of the others could have hit me , could have killed me . It was the most frightening thought I had ever had in my life — the terror filled me entirely . Gabby kneeled beside Rafael and pushed dirt in with his two hands . Doc twisted away , and Kathryn and Mrs. Nicolin led him back toward the Eggloffs ' . But all I did was stand and watch ; I watched and watched ; and it fills me with shame to write it , but I became glad . I was glad it was n't me down there . I was so glad to be there alive and seeing it all , I thought thank God it was n't me ! Thank God it was Mando got killed , and not me . Thank God ! Thank God ! Sometimes after a funeral quite a wake would develop at the Eggloffs ' , but not this morning . This morning everyone went home . Pa led me down the river path . I was so tired my feet did n't make it over bumps . Without Pa I would have fallen more than once . “
201255	201262	200941	200941	we	5059	" Pa asked , reproachful again . “
201270	201614	201265	201265	you	5061	” There were people strung along the trail , shaking their heads , talking , looking back at us . When we got home I tried to explain to Pa what had happened , but I could n't do it . The look in his eye stopped me . I lay down on my bed and slept . I would say I slept like a dead man , but it is n't so . It 's never so . Sleep does n't knit the raveled sleeve of care , no matter what Macbeth said ( or hoped ) . He was wrong that time as he was so often . Sleep is just time out . You can do all the knitting you like in dreams , but when you call time in it unravels in an instant and you 're back where you started . No sleep or dream 324 Kim Stanley Robinson was going to knit back the last day for me ; it was unraveled for good . Past . Nevertheless , I slept all through that day and evening , and when Pa 's voice , or his sewing machine , or a dog 's bark pulled me halfway out of slumber , I knew I did n't want to wake even though I did n't quite remember why , and I worked at returning to sleep until I slid back down the slope to dreams again . I slept through most of the evening , struggling harder and harder to hold onto it as the hours passed . But you ca n't sleep forever . What broke my last hold on an uneasy half - sleep was the w - whoo , w - whoo of the canyon owl - Nicolin 's signal , repeated insistently . Nicolin was out there , under the eucalyptus no doubt , calling me . I sat up , looked out the door ; saw him , a shadow against the treetrunk . Pa was sewing . I got my shoes on . “
201620	201716	201265	201265	you	5061	” Pa looked at me , hurt me once again with the puzzled reproach in his eyes , the slight hint of condemnation . I was still wearing the torn clothes I had had on the night before . They stank with fear . I was ravenous , and paused to break off half a loaf of bread on my way out . I approached Steve chewing a big lump . We stood together silently under the tree . He had a full bag over his shoulder . When the bread was done I said , "
201721	201722	201718	201718	you	5062	” “
201792	201793	201794	201794	Mando	485	" “
201798	201799	201794	201794	Mando	485	” “
201804	201805	201794	201794	Mando	485	" “
201810	201811	201808	201808	you	0	” “
201839	201859	201835	201835	She	5067	” We stood there for a long time . Steve took in a deep breath and let it out . “
201869	201870	201864	201864	I	0	” “
201876	201877	201873	201873	you	0	" "
201885	201913	201873	201873	you	0	” My night vision was coming in and with the exhausted sound of his voice I could suddenly see his face , dirty , scratched , desperate . “
201916	201917	201873	201873	you	0	” “
201920	202035	201873	201873	you	0	" He took off toward the river . THE WILD SHORE 325 We went to the Marianis ' , stood by the ovens . Steve made his owl call . We waited a long time . Steve tapped his fist against the side of the oven . Even I , with nothing at stake , felt nervous . That led me back to all that had happened the night before . The door opened and Kathryn slipped out , in the same pants she had worn the night before , but a different sweatshirt . Steve 's fingernails scraped the brick . She knew where he would be , and walked straight to us . “
202041	202059	202037	202037	you	5068	” She stared at him , head cocked to one side . : Steve shook his head . “
202065	202071	202037	202037	you	5068	” He cleared his throat . “
202121	202127	202128	202128	I	0	” Kathryn stared at him . “
202137	202141	202142	202142	You	5068	” Steve said . “
202145	202146	202147	202147	I	0	” “
202151	202195	202147	202147	I	0	” The way he said that , I knew he was leaving . Kathryn knew it too . She folded her arms over her chest and hugged herself as if she were cold . She looked over at me and I looked down . “
202203	202400	202201	202201	Henry	284	” I nodded and wandered to the river . The water clicked over snags like black glass . I wondered what he was saying to her , what she was saying to him . Would she try to change his mind when she knew he would n't ? I was glad I did n't know . It hurt to think of it . I saw Doc 's face as he watched his son , the living part of his wife , lowered into the ground beside her . Helpless to stop myself I thought what if the old man dies tonight , right up there at Doc 's place ? What about Doc then ? ... What about Tom ? I sat and held my head but it did n't stop me thinking . Sometimes it would be such a blessing to turn all the thinking off . I stood and tossed rocks in the water . I sat down again when the rocks were gone , and wished I could throw away thoughts as easily , or the deeds of the past . Steve appeared and stood looking over the river . I stood up . “
202406	202663	202201	202201	Henry	284	" he said thickly . He walked down the river path toward the sea , cut into the forest . There was no talk between us , just the silent walking together , side by side , and 326 Kim Stanley Robinson briefly I recalled how it had felt for so long , for all our lives , when we had hiked together silently in the woods at night like brothers . Past . He went down the cliff path without looking at it , going from foothold to foothold with careless mastery . There was a slice of moon , nearly on the water . I descended the obscure cliff more slowly . Once on the sand I followed him to the boats . We broke the sand 's water crust , left big footprints in the loose sand below . A couple of the fishing boats had sockets on the keel , where you could step a small mast and spread a sail . Nicolin went to one of those . Without a word we took bow and stern and skewed the boat from side to side in the sand . Normally four or five men push a boat into the water , but that 's just for convenience ; Steve and I got it moving pretty easily . When it was across the tide flat and in the shallows we stopped . Nicolin climbed in to step the mast , and I held the hull steady on the sand bottom . I said , “
202680	202681	202673	202678	the guy who wrote that book	5073	" “
202686	202687	202673	202678	the guy who wrote that book	5073	” “
202698	202706	202707	202707	I	0	” He never stopped unfurling the sail . “
202725	202726	202719	202719	I	0	” “
202739	202740	202727	202727	They	5074	” “
202746	202786	202743	202743	you	0	” I did know , but I could n't say . The mast was stepped and he started jamming the cotter pin through the socket . I did n't want to just come out and ask him to stay . “
202800	202805	202787	202787	I	0	" He stopped working . “
202814	202819	202820	202820	You	5072	” he said bitterly . “
202867	202891	202854	202859	a lot of Americans already there	5076	" I could see he would have an answer to everything . I shifted the boat 's stern , got ready to push . “
202902	202906	202895	202896	the resistance	7003	” he said . “
202925	202926	202920	202920	you	5072	" "
202929	202930	202920	202920	you	5072	" “
202968	202975	202966	202966	Henry	284	" He waved a hand westward . "
202978	202985	202966	202966	Henry	284	" I leaned over the stern . “
203000	203188	202991	202991	you	5072	” He pursed his lips , shrugged . His shoulders drooped when the shrug was done , and I saw how tired he was . It would be a long sail . But I was n't going to go , and I was n't going to explain . He had n't expected me to say yes anyway , had he ? He roused himself , got out of the boat to push . Quickly it floated clear of the sand . We stared at each other from across the boat , and he stuck out his hand . We shook . I could n't think of anything to say . He leaped in and got the oars out while I held the stern . I shoved it into the current and he started rowing . With the crescent moon behind him I could n't make out his features , and we did n't say a word . He rowed over a swell coming upriver . Soon he 'd be out where what was left of the Santa Ana would clear the cliff , and catch his sail . "
203192	203264	202966	202966	Henry	284	" I cried . He rowed on . The next swell hid the boat from me for a moment . I walked out of the river , feeling chill . From the beach I watched him clear the rivermouth . The sail , a faint patch against the black , flapped and filled . Soon he was beyond the break . From there he would n't hear me unless I shouted . “
203273	208517	202966	202966	Henry	284	” I said , but I was talking to myself . I climbed the cliff path , water dripping from my pants . By the time I got to the top I was warmer . I walked along the cliff . It was a cloudless night again , and the setting moon shone across the water , marking the distance to the horizon . It was a night to make you see how vast the world was : the ocean , the spangled sky , the cliff , the valley and the hills behind , they were all so huge I might as well have been an ant . Out there under a pale handkerchief patch was another ant , in an ant 's boat . On the horizon I could see it : dark mass of the sea below , dark sky above , and between them the black bulk of Catalina , bejeweled with white points of light both fixed and moving , and red lights to mark the highest peaks , and a few yellow and green lights here and there . It was like a bright constellation , the finest constellation , always on the verge of setting . For years I had considered it the prettiest sight I had ever seen . There was a cluster of light on the water at the south end that 328 Kim Stanley Robinson was invisible from the cliff — the foreigners ' port - it could be seen from the height of Tom 's house on a night like this , but I had no desire to go up there and see it . The dim patch of Nicolin 's sail moved out of the narrow path of moonlight on the water , and disappeared . He was one of the shadows among the few moony glitters on the black sea , but strain my eyes as I might I could n't tell which one he was . For all I could tell the ocean had swallowed him . But I knew it had n't . The little boat was still out there somewhere , sailing west to Avalon . I stayed on the cliff looking out to sea for a long time . Then I could n't stand it , and took off into the forest . Leaves clacked and pine needles quivered as I trudged under the trees . The valley never seemed so big and empty as it did then . In a clearing I looked back ; the lights of Catalina blinked and danced , but I turned and walked on . I did n't give a damn if I never saw Catalina again . Chapter Twenty - one The forest at night is a funny place . The trees get bigger , and they seem to come alive , as though during the day they were asleep or gone from their bodies , and only at night do they animate themselves and live , perhaps even pulling up their roots and walking the valley floors . If you 're out there you can sometimes almost catch them at it , just beyond the corner of your eye . Of course on a moonless night it only takes a little wind to imagine such things . Branches dip to tousle the hair , and the falling - water sounds of the leaves are like soft voices calling in the distance . Two holes make eyes , a trail blaze is a smiling mouth , branches are arms , leaves hands . Easy . Still I think it may be true that they are a type of nocturnal animal . They are alive , after all . We tend to forget that . In the spring they sprout joyously , in the summer they bask in the sun , in the winter they suffer bare and cold . Just like us . Except they sleep during the day and come awake at night . So if you want to have much to do with them , night is the time to be out among them . 329 330 Kim Stanley Robinson The different trees wake up in different ways , and they treat you differently . Eucalyptus trees are friendly and talkative . Their branches tend to grow across each other , and in a wind they creak constantly . And their hanging leaves twirl and clack together , making the falling - water sound , a rising and falling voice that caresses like a hug , or a brushing of the forehead . The eucalyptus has a great voice . But you would n't want to touch one , or give it a hug , unless you could see it and avoid the gum . The bark is smooth and cool , fragrant like the rest of the tree with that sharp dusty smell , but it does n't grow as fast as the wood inside it , I guess , and there are a lot of breaks in it as a result , cracks that split it completely . These cracks leak gum like a dog slobbers , and in the dark you ca n't keep from getting your hands and arms in it , and coming away all sticky . · Pine trees are more forbidding speakers . In a breeze their quiet whoooos are fey , and the wild ohhhhhhhs they utter when the wind is up can raise the hair on the back of your neck . But pines feel good to the touch , and you can look at their black silhouettes against the sky forever . Torrey pines have the longest needles , and their little branches are all curly . They spiral off the main branches like pieces of the springs that Rafael keeps in his shop , and make lovely patterns against the others . And the rough , brittle bark feels wonderful against the skin , it 's like a giant cat 's tongue . Redwood bark is even better , all split and hairy ; you can put your fingers in cracks around the sides and hold on for dear life . It 's like hugging a bear , or holding on to your ma and crying into her hair . Good friends , pine trees , though you have to ignore their stern voice and touch them to find that out . Of course there are real living things in the forest at night , mobile things I mean , animals like us . A whole bunch of them , in fact : coyotes and weasels and skunks and raccoons and deer , and cats and rabbits and possums and bears and who knows what all . But damned if you 'd know it by just walking around . Even a lone human sitting in the forest for hours might not catch sight of a single creature — much less a human who is crashing around hugging trees and such . Someone like that is n't going to see a single animal , or even hear one except for frogs . Frogs do n't scare easily , they 've got the river to hop in and they do n't care . You have to come close to stepping on them before they 'll shut up , much less move . All the others , THE WILD SHORE 331 though , they hear you coming or smell you way off , and they get out of the way and you never know they 've been there , except if you chance to hear a rustle off in the distance . Of course a big cat might decide to eat you , but you hope they 'd be wary enough to stay out of the valley . Generally they avoid crowds , and in the fall they 're not very hungry . So ... if you walk about you do n't see a creature anywhere , which is funny because you know they 're around you , getting a drink , chomping on sprouts or dead prey , hunting for or hiding from each other . But I forgot about the birds . Occasionally you 'll see the quick black shape of an owl , flying without a sound . It 's uncanny how complete their silence is . Or higher , geese or herons migrating , their heads poked ahead on those long necks , flying in V 's that flow in and out of shape . Sometimes it looks like they 're playing Change the Leader , each one taking a turn . ( Crows on the other hand will play Follow the Leader , almost every fine evening at sunset . ) That night I saw a flock of geese , flying south . Two pairs of wide V 's , passing over the valley in the hour before dawn , when the sky was blueing and I could see them quite clearly . Slow , steady wing strokes , and quite a conversation going on up there in that honk and squawk language . ... Of course they are n't part of the forest proper , but you can see them while in the forest . And I did see them that night . I slept earlier against a redwood , and then for a while curled between two gnarly roots . Mostly , though , I walked around . I had spent a lot of time in the forest , day and night , without paying the least attention to it . It was just home , nothing special . But this night I did n't want to think about anything . I was determined not to think about anything , so for long stretches I succeeded . I studied tree after tree , hung out with them and really got to know them well , touched them , climbed a couple ... sat looking for the animals I knew were about , too , but as I said they do n't like people watching them . I heard some scuffling a few times , but I did n't even see a squirrel . Where the creek from Swing Canyon meets the river is a little meadow that always has a lot of animal tracks in it . I wandered that way when I woke up and saw the geese overhead , in hope of seeing some furry brothers taking a drink . Sure enough , after I lay in the ferns behind a fungus - riddled log for a while , watching a spider weave her morning web , a family 332 Kim Stanley Robinson - - - --- - - - - - - of deer came down and drank . Buck , doe , fawn . The buck looked around and sniffed ; he knew I was there , but he did n't care about it , which showed good judgment . The doe was fastidious in the mud banking the creek , but the fawn staggered around in it . It was about a three - month fawn , so it could have walked perfectly well , but it seemed to want to bother its ma . When they were done drinking they pushed off , across the meadow and out of sight . I clambered up stiffly , went down to the creek and drank myself . My pants were still damp and my legs were cold , and I was stiff , and dirty , and cut up , and hungry , and dog tired , but mainly I felt all right . I walked down the west riverbank empty as an empty bowl . I was n't going to start crying again , no matter whether I thought of Mando and Steve or not . I could think of them and not feel much of anything . It was done , and I was empty . But then I rounded the bend above the bridge , and caught sight of a figure downriver on the same bank , at the foot of the cornfields . This was still early morning , when the whole world was nothing but shades of gray - a thousand shades of gray , but not a hint of color . Dew soaked every gray leaf and sprig and fern on the ground , a sign that the Santa Ana was ending . A mouse squeaked as I clumped by its home . I stopped , but not because of the mouse . The figure downstream was a woman . ( If a person is visible we know their sex , no matter how distant they are — I'm not sure how we tell sometimes , but it 's so . ) And the dark gray shade of this woman 's hair would be brown in the sun , brown with a bit of red in it . Already in this world of grays I could see that touch of red . Kathryn it was , standing at the foot of her fields . From the knee down her pants were darker — wet , then , which meant she had been out walking for a while . Maybe she had been out all night too , I thought , yet another animal in the night forest that I had not seen . Her back was to me . I would have gone to her , but something held me . There are times when a back a hundred yards away is as expressive as ever our faces are . She started and began walking downstream , toward the bridge . At the end of the field she suddenly swung to her right and gave a fearsome kick to the last cornstalk . She wears big boots and the stalk shuddered and stayed tilted over . That did n't satisfy her . She got set and kicked it again and again , till it was flattened . The scene blurred before me and I THE WILD SHORE 333 stumbled away through the woods , all our catastrophes made real to me again . So I was not as empty as I had thought . My capacity for feeling miserable was higher than I had imagined , a lot higher . I found I could feel miserable for days , that between feeling miserable and feeling empty as a dry gourd I could occupy every hour of every day . And that was what I did , day after day . It was a surprise to me , and not a pleasant one , but I could n't help it . That was how I felt , and our feelings are not in our control . I took to spending a lot of time on the beach . I could n't abide being with people . One day I tried to rejoin the fishing , but that was no good ; they were too hard . Another time I wandered by the ovens , but I left ; poor Kristen had a look that pierced me . Even eating with Pa made me feel bad . And I could n't visit the old man , he was too sick , it made me despair . Everyone 's eyes questioned me , or condemned me , or watched me when they did n't think I was going to notice : they tried to console me , or to act like nothing was different , which was a lie . Everything was different . So I did n't want any part of them . The beach was a good place to get away . Our beach is so wide from cliff to water , and so long from the coarse sand at the rivermouth to the jumbled white boulders of Concrete Bay , that you can wander on it for days without crossing your path , hardly . Long furrows from old high tides , filled with brackish water ; tangled driftwood , including old logs with their octopus roots sticking up ; sandflea infested seaweed , like mounds of black compost ; shells whole and broken ; sand crabs and the telltale bubbles they leave in the wet sand ; the little round white sandpipers with their backwards knees , charging up and down the shingle together to avoid the soup ; all of these were worth investigating for hours and days . So I wandered up and down the beach and investigated them , and was miserable , or empty . See , I could have not told them . Of course I could have refused to have anything to do with the whole plan right from the start . That is what I should have done . But even after I went along with it , I could have kept to myself what I had found out about the landing , and none of it would ever have happened . I had even considered it , and came close to doing just that . But I had n't . I had made my decision , and everything that had happened - Mando 's death , Steve 's flight — all fol- 334 Kim Stanley Robinson lowed from that . So it was my fault . I was to blame for one friend 's running away , another 's death . And for who knows how many other deaths that had come that might , of people who were strangers to me , but who no doubt had families and friends grieving for them like we grieved for Mando . All of it came from my thinking , from my decision . How I felt it . How I wished I had thought it out better , and decided the other way ! I would have given anything to change that decision . But there 's nothing as unchangeable as the past . Striding up the river path to home I recalled what the old man had said there , about how we were wedged in a crack by history so our choices were squeezed down ; but now I knew that compared to the way the past is wedged in there , the present is as free as the open air . In the present you have choices , but in the past you only did one thing ; regret it with all your power , it wo n't change . I knew that , or I was learning it , but that did n't stop me from regretting the past , or wishing for a different one . If I had been smarter , Mando would n't have died . Not only smarter -- more honest . I had lied to and betrayed Kathryn , Tom , Pa- the whole valley , because of the vote . Everybody but Steve , and he was on Catalina . What a fool I had been ! Here I thought I had been so clever , getting the time and place out of Add , leading the San Diegans up to the ambush . But it was us who had been ambushed . As soon as I thought of it that way it was obvious . Those folks had n't just been defending themselves on the spur of the moment- they were ready for us . And who else would have warned them but Addison Shanks ? He knew we knew about the landing , and all he had had to do was tell the scavengers we knew , and they could prepare for us . Ambush us . Well once I thought of it , it was as obvious as the sun in the sky , but it really had n't occurred to me until then , walking up the river path and brooding over it . They had ambushed the ambushers . And the San Diegans had set us farther north than them so that if anything went wrong , we would be the last over the bridge and would take up the attention of the enemy while the San Diegans escaped . Thrown in the road to trip them . We had been twice betrayed . And I had been an incredible fool . And my foolishness had cost Mando his life . I wished fiercely ( now that the funeral was well past ) that I had died and not THE WILD SHORE 335 him . But I knew that wishing was like throwing rocks at the moon ( so I was safe ) . Wandering the beach and thinking about it a couple days later , I got curious and went up Basilone to the Shankses ' . I did n't have anything in mind to say to them , but I wanted to see them . If I saw their faces I would know if I was right or not about Add warning the scavengers , and then I could be shut of them for good . Their house was burned down . Nobody was around . I stepped across the charred boards that were all that was left of the south wall , and kicked around in the piles of charcoal for a bit . Dust and ash puffed away from my boot . They were long gone . I stood in the middle of what had been their storage room , and looked at the black lumps on the ground . Nothing metal . It looked like they had emptied the place of valuables before they fired it . They must have had help moving north . After what I had caught Add doing , as soon as they heard of my survival they must have decided to move north and join the scavengers completely . And of course Addison would n't leave us such a house . The north wall was still there , black planks eaten through and ready to fall ; the rest of the wood was ash , or ends and lumps scattered about . The old metal poles of the electric tower were visible again , rising up soot - black to the metal platform that had once held the wires up . I felt as empty as always . It had been a good house . They were n't good people , but it had been a good house . And somehow , standing in the charred ruins of it , I could n't bring up any feeling against Add and Melissa , although I could have easily moments before . It could n't have been any fun to fire a good home like this and flee . And were they really that bad ? Working with scavengers , so what . We all traded with them some way or other . Even helping the Japanese to land , was that surely so bad ? Glen Baum had done it in that book of his ( if he had done any of it ) , and no one called him traitor . Add and Melissa just wanted something different than I did . In ways they were better than I was . At least they kept their promises ; they had their loyalties intact . I dogged back into the valley , lower than ever . Stopped at Doc 's : Tom sick , asleep and looking like death ; Doc holloweyed at the kitchen table , alone , staring at the wall . I hustled down to the river , crossed the bridge , stopped at the bathhouse 336 Kim Stanley Robinson latrine to relieve myself . I walked out as John Nicolin walked in . He glared at me , brushed by me without a word . So I went to the beach . And the next day I went back . I was getting to know the troops of little sandpipers : the one with one leg , the black one , the broken - beaked one . The tide moved in , drowning the flies ' dining table . It moved back out , exposing the wet seaweed again . Gulls wheeled and shrieked . Once a pelican landed on the wet strand and stood there looking about aloofly . The shorebreak was big that day , however , and he was slow to get out from under a thick rushing lip . It thumped down on him as he hurried away and he tumbled , long wings and beak and neck and legs thrashing around in a tangled somersault . I laughed as he struggled up , all wet and bedraggled and huffy ; but he walked funny as he ran to take off and glide down the beach , and when I was done laughing I cried . The clouds came back . A gray wall sat on the horizon , and pieces of it broke loose and were carried onshore by the wind . The wind had backed at last . The Santa Ana had held the clouds out to sea for over a week , and now they were coming back to claim their territory . At first there were just a few of them , loose - knit and transparent except at their centers . Clouds beget clouds , though , and through the afternoon they came in darker and lower , until the whole wall picked up and advanced from the horizon , turning dark blue and covering the sky like a blanket . The air got cold , the gulls disappeared , the onshore wind picked up . The clouds grew top heavy , spat lightning onto the sea and then the land , sizzling waves and shattering trees on the ridges . I sat on a worn grey log and watched the first raindrops pock the sand . The iron surface of the ocean lost its sheen as the rain hit it . I pulled my coat around me and stubbornly sat there . The rain turned to hail . Hail fell until there was a layer of clear grains on top of the tawny ones : a beach of sand overlaid by a beach of glass . I walked down the beach , climbed the cliff path . The hail turned back to rain . Hands in pockets I strode the river path , and let the rain strike me in the face . It ran down inside my coat , and I did n't care . I stayed out and walked through clearings and treeless patches on purpose , and it gave me pleasure because it was such a stupid thing to do . I kept on up the valley until I stood at the edge of the little clearing occupied by the graveyard . Rain poured on it from THE WILD SHORE 337 low clouds just overhead , and in the dim gray light trees dripped and the ground splashed . I crossed the little section near the river where all the Japanese who had washed ashore had been buried . Their wooden crosses said Unknown Chinese , Died 2045 , or whatever the date happened to be . Nat did a nice job carving letters and numbers . Out in the clearing proper were our people . I squished from grave to grave , contemplating the names . Vincent Mariani , 1992 - 2038 . A cancer got him . I remembered him playing hide and seek with Kathryn and Steve and me , when Kristen was a baby . Arnold Kalinski , 1970 - 2026 . He had come to the valley with a disease , Tom said ; Doc had been afraid we all would catch it , but we did n't . Jane Howard Fletcher , 2002 - 2030 . My mother , right there . Pneumonia . I pulled out some weeds from around the base of the cross , moved on . John Manley Morris , 1975 - 2029 ; Eveline Morris , 1989 - 2033 . Cancer for him ; she died of an infected cut in the palm of her hand . John Nicolin , Junior , 2016 - 2022 . Fell in the river . Matthew Hamish , 2034 . Malformed . Mark Hamish , 2036 . Luke Hamish , 2039 . Both malformed . Francesca Hamish , 2044 . Same . And Jo pregnant again . Geoffrey Jones , 1995 - 2040 ; Ann Jones , died 2040 . They both died when their house burned . Endeavor Simpson , 2039 . Malformed . Defiance Simpson , 2043 . Malformed . Elizabeth Costa , 2000 - 2035 . Some disease , Doc never figured out what . Armando Thomas Costa , 2033 - 2047 . There were more , but I stopped my progress and stood at the foot of Mando 's grave , looking at the fresh carving on the cross . Even the Bible says something about men living their three score and ten , and that was ever so long ago . And here we were , cut short like frogs in a frost . The dirt filling Mando 's grave had settled , and it was sinking more in the rain . I went to the broken - up pit at the back of the clearing and took the shovel that Nat always leaves there , and started carrying dirt over to the grave , shovelful by shovelful . Mud stuck to the shovel , it spread out badly , it would n't tamp down right . Bad idea . I threw the shovel back at the pit and sat on the grass at the side of the grave , where I could hold the crossbar of the marker . Frogs in a frost . Rain thinned the mud , puddled on it . I looked around at our crop of crosses , all of them dripping in the gray afternoon light , and I thought , This is n't right . It is n't supposed to be like this . Mando was under me and yet he was n't ; he was plain gone , vanished , no 338 Kim Stanley Robinson more . He would n't come back . I took a handful of mud and squished it between my fingers . Mando had changed from a living person to no more than the mud in my hand . And the same thing was going to happen to every person I knew . And to me . Nothing we did was going to make any difference ; nothing would last no matter what we said . I did n't see the point . It was too strange to live and work in the world till I broke , and then just go to mud . I sat there in the rain and squeezed the mud between my fingers . Squish squish . Squish , squish . Chapter Twenty - two But the old man lived . The old man lived . I hardly believed it . I think everybody was surprised , even Tom . I know Doc was : “
208524	208541	208518	208518	I	0	” he told me happily when I went up to see them on a cloudy morning . “
208612	208613	208606	208606	he	5082	” “
208617	208624	208606	208606	he	5082	" Tom called from the bedroom , "
208641	208642	208632	208632	you	5084	” “
208656	208665	208648	208648	you	5084	” Doc shouted back , grinning at me . “
208673	208674	208632	208632	you	5084	” “
208678	208703	208632	208632	you	5084	” I went into the hospital and there he was sitting up in his bed , blinking like a bird . Shyly I said , “
208708	208714	208706	208706	you	5082	" 339 340 Kim Stanley Robinson “
208717	208718	208706	208706	you	5082	" “
208725	208732	208706	208706	you	5082	” Doc said from behind me . “
208741	208742	208706	208706	you	5082	" “
208752	208759	208744	208744	you	5084	” said Tom . Doc snorted . “
208795	208796	208784	208784	he	5082	" “
208804	208805	208801	208801	I	0	" "
208811	208815	208801	208801	I	0	" Doc exclaimed . “
208855	208856	208852	208852	I	0	" "
208863	208867	208852	208852	I	0	” Tom crowed , "
208885	208895	208877	208877	I	0	" He slurped the tea , cursed its heat . "
208919	208981	208916	208916	him	5082	" Doc watched with satisfaction as Tom tossed down chunks of bread in his old starvation manner . When he was done he smiled his gap - toothed smile . His poor gums had taken a beating in his illness , but his eyes watched me with their old clear brown gaze . I felt my face stretched into a grin . "
208985	208989	208916	208916	him	5082	" Tom said . "
209027	209175	209177	209178	the crowd	972	" He coughed once or twice , slid down under the covers and was out like one of his lighters snapping off . So that was good . Tom stayed at Doc 's for another couple of weeks , mostly to keep Doc company , I believe , as he was getting stronger by the day , and he surely was n't fond of the hospital . And one day Rebel knocked on the door and asked me if I wanted to help move Tom and his stuff back to his house . I said sure , and we walked across the bridge talking and joking . The sun was playing hide and seek among tall clouds , and coming down the path from Doc 's were Kathryn and Gabby , Kristen and Del and Doc , laughing as Tom cavorted at the head of the parade . “
209180	209186	209177	209178	the crowd	972	" Tom called to us . “
209203	209307	209177	209178	the crowd	972	” Kathryn gave me Tom 's books , heavy in a burlap sack , and I threatened to throw them off the bridge as we crossed . Tom swung at me with his walking stick . We made a fine promenade up the other slope of the valley . I had never allowed THE WILD SHORE 341 myself to imagine this day ; but there it was , right in my hands where I could grab it . Once up to his house the old man got positively boisterous . With a dramatic flourish he kicked the door , but it stayed shut . “
209314	209359	209177	209178	the crowd	972	” He puffed at the dust on the table and chairs until the air was thick with it . There was a puddle on the floor , marking a new leak in the roof . Tom pulled his mouth down into a pouting frown . “
209377	209378	209371	209371	You	5093	” “
209382	209386	209371	209371	You	5093	” said Kathryn , “
209406	209539	209388	209388	you	5093	” We opened all the windows and let the breeze draft through . Gabby and Del yanked some weeds , and Tom and Doc and I walked up the ridge trail to look at the beehives . Tom cursed at the sight , but they were n't that bad off . We cleaned up for a bit and went back down to the house on Doc 's orders . Smoke billowed white as the clouds from the stove chimney , the big front window was scrubbed clean , and Gabby was balanced on the roof with hammer and nails and shingles , hunting for that leak and shouting for instructions from below . When we went in Kathryn was on a stool , thumping the underside of the roof with a broom . "
209544	209548	209388	209388	you	5093	" Tom said , "
209557	209609	209388	209388	you	5093	” Kathryn took a swing at him with the broom , overbalanced and leaped off the falling stool . Kristen dodged her with a yelp and quit dusting , Rebel took the kettle off the stove , and we gathered in the living room for some of Tom 's pungent tea . “
209612	210259	209388	209388	you	5093	” Tom said , holding his steaming mug high , and we raised ours and said back cheers , cheers . That evening when I came home Pa said that John Nicolin had come by to ask why I was n't fishing anymore . My share of the fish was our main source of food , and Pa was upset . So I started fishing again the next day , and after that I went fishing day in and day out , when the weather allowed . On the boats it was obvious the year was getting on . The sun cut across the sky lower and lower , and a cold current came in and stayed . Often in the afternoons dark clouds rolled off the sea over us . Wet hands stung with cold , and hauling net made them raw red ; teeth chattered , skin prickled with goosebumps . Hoarse shouts concerning the fishing were the only words exchanged , as men conserved their energy . The lack of small talk was fine 342 Kim Stanley Robinson by me . Blustery winds chafed us as we rowed back in the premature dusks . Under the blue clouds the cliffs turned brown , the hillsides were the green - black of the darkest pines , and the ocean was like iron . In all that gloom the yellow bonfires on the river flat blazed like beacons , and it was a pleasure to round the first bend in the river and see them . After getting the boats up against the cliff I huddled with the rest of the men around these fires until I was warm enough to go home . As the men warmed ( hands practically in the flames ) , the usual talk spilled out , but I never joined in . Even though I was happy the old man was well and home , the truth was that it did n't do much to cheer me in the day to day . I felt bad a lot of the time , and empty always . When I was out fishing , struggling to make cold disobedient fingers hold onto the nets , I 'd think of some crack or curse Steve would have made in the situation , and I longed to hear him say it . And when the fishing was done , there was no gang up on the cliff waiting for me to join them . To avoid climbing the cliff and feeling their absence I often walked around the point of the cliff to the sea beach , and wandered that familiar expanse . The next day I 'd take a deep breath , push myself into my boots and go fishing again . But I was just going through the motions . It was n't that the men on the boats were unfriendly , either . On the contrary - Marvin kept giving me the best of the fish to take home , and Rafael talked to me more than he ever had , joshing about the fish , describing his latest projects ( which were interesting , I had to admit ) , inviting me by to see them .... They were all like that , even John from time to time . But none of it meant anything to me . I was empty . My heart felt like my fingers did when the fishing was done , cold and disobedient , numb even next to the fire . Somehow Tom figured this out . Maybe Rafael told him , maybe he saw it himself . One day after the fishing I clawed my way up the cliff path , feeling like I weighed as much as three of me , and there was Tom on the top . I said , “
210269	210281	210260	210260	You	5096	” He ignored that and shook a knobby finger at me . “
210289	210293	210260	210260	You	5096	” I cringed . “
210301	210320	210298	210298	you	5096	” I looked down at my bag of fish , but he grabbed my arm and pulled it . “
210326	210327	210330	210330	Tom	351	” “
210332	210351	210330	210330	Tom	351	” What could I say ? He knew what it was . I said , THE WILD SHORE 343 "

210424	210430	210416	210416	They	5098	” I shook my head . “
210439	210477	210433	210433	I	0	” I explained to him what had happened , what my part had been - every bit ‘ of it . He nodded as I got each sentence out . When I was done , he said , “
210485	210500	210433	210433	I	0	" I was shivering , and he started up the river path with me . “
210524	210525	210514	210514	You	5096	" “
210541	210542	210536	210536	I	0	" "

210612	210637	210610	210610	Tom	351	” He shoved me in the chest , hard , so that I staggered out of the path and had to catch my footing . “
210640	210642	210610	210610	Tom	351	" . “
210652	210666	210645	210645	you	5096	" That stung . I was round - eyed as he went on . “

210729	210771	210727	210727	Tom	351	" And he charged me , shoved me again ! It was the kind of thing he used to indulge in only with Steve , and at the same time I was getting ready to punch him one I was flattered . “
210778	210792	210727	210727	Tom	351	” he cried , and all at once I realized he was upset . “
210803	210804	210799	210799	You	351	” “
210861	210873	210874	210874	I	0	” I nodded , my throat tight . I cleared it . “
210878	210879	210874	210874	I	0	” “
210888	210904	210874	210874	I	0	” I hopped away so he could n't shove 344 Kim Stanley Robinson me again . “
210935	211441	210923	210923	You	5096	" He shook his fist at me , his arm a bundle of ligaments under skin , skinny as a rope . I almost had to laugh . So I thought about it . I got the book down from the shelf , where it had been propping up a whetstone holder with only two legs . I looked through the blank pages . There were a lot of them . It was as clear as a stonefish is ugly that I would never be able to fill all those pages . For one thing , it would take too long . But I kept thinking about it . The emptiness still afflicted me . And as the days got shorter the nights in our shack got longer , and I found those memories were always in my mind . And the old man had been awful vehement about it ..... Before I even lifted a pencil , however , Kathryn declared it was time to harvest the corn . When she decided it was time , all of us who worked for her worked dawn to dusk , every day . Right after sunup I was out there with the others slashing at stalks with a scythe , then carrying stalks to the wains , pulling them over the bridge to the barrows and warehouses behind the Marianis ' , stripping off the leaves , pulling off the husked ears . The bad summer storms made it a poor harvest . Soon we were done and it was time for the potatoes . Kathryn and I worked together on those . We had n't spent much time together since the night at Doc 's , and at first I was uncomfortable , but she did n't seem to blame me for anything . We just worked , and talked potatoes . Working with Kathryn was exhausting . In the mornings it seemed all right , because she worked so hard that she did more than her share , but the trouble was she kept going at that pace all day , so I got hooked into doing more than a day 's work every day no matter how much I let her go at it . And harvesting potatoes is dirty , backbreaking labor , any way you do it . When the harvesting was done we celebrated with a little drinking at the bathhouse . No one got overjoyed , because it was a bad harvest , but at least it was in . Kathryn sat beside me in the chairs on the bathhouse lawn to watch the sunset , and Rebel and Kristen joined us . At the other end of the yard Del and Gabby tossed a football back and forth . The flames of a bonfire were scarcely visible against the salmon sky . Rebel THE WILD SHORE 345 was upset about the potato harvest , even crying a little , and Kathryn talked a lot to cheer her up . “
211492	211510	211489	211489	you	5099	” Kristen smiled at that , the first smile I had seen from her since Mando died . “
211516	211520	211511	211511	Nobody	683	” I said . “
211529	211539	211522	211522	I	0	” Rebel said . The girls laughed at her . "
211551	211561	211540	211540	You	5099	” Kristen said . Kathryn sipped her whiskey lazily . “
211571	211572	211569	211569	Hank	284	" “
211584	211594	211580	211580	Tom	351	” I lied , to see how it sounded . “
211605	211606	211599	211599	you	5099	” "
211609	211615	211599	211599	you	5099	” She raised her eyebrows . “
211617	211618	211599	211599	you	5099	” “
211621	211622	211599	211599	you	5099	" “
211625	211632	211599	211599	you	5099	” She stared into the fire . “
211660	211661	211599	211599	you	5099	" "
211666	211671	211599	211599	you	5099	” I assured her . “
211690	212210	211684	211684	I	0	" All three of the girls looked impressed . So I thought about it some more . I took the book off the shelf again , and kept it on the little stand beside my bed , next to the lamp and the cup and the book of Shakespeare 's plays Tom had given me as a Christmas present . And I thought about it . When it had all begun , so long ago ... those meetings with the gang , planning the summer . It would n't actually be graverobbing , Steve had said , and I had snapped awake .... So I started writing it . It was slow work . Me trying to write is like Odd Roger trying to talk . Every night I quit for good . But the next night , or the one after , I would begin again . It 's astonishing how much the memory will surrender when you squeeze it . Some nights when I finished writing I 'd come to , surprised to be in our shack , sweat pouring down my ribs , my hand stiff , my fingers sore , my heart pounding with the emotions of time past . And away from the work , out on the boats heaving over the wild swells , I found myself thinking of what had happened , of 346 Kim Stanley Robinson ways to say it . I knew I was going to finish that book no matter what it took from me . I was hooked . The evenings of the autumn took on a patter . When the fish were on the tables I climbed the cliff . No gang to meet me . Steadfastly I ignored the ghost gathering and hiked home , usually through the early evening gloom . At home Pa greased the skillet and fried up some fish and onions , while I lit the lamp and set the table , and we made the usual small talk about what had happened during the day . When the fish was ready we sat down and Pa said grace , and we ate the fish and bread or potatoes . Afterwards we washed up and put things away and drank the rest of the dinner water , and brushed our teeth with a scavenged toothbrush . Then Pa sat at the sewing table , and I sat at the dinner table , and he stitched together clothes while I stitched together words , until we agreed it was time for bed . I do n't know how many nights went by like that . On rainy days it was the same , only all day long . Once a week or so I went up to Tom 's . Since I promised I was writing he had relented and agreed to give me more lessons . He had me in Othello , and I was pretty sure I knew why . I thought I had things to regret , but Othello ! He was the only man in Shakespeare more fool than I. “
212326	212327	212329	212329	they	5111	" “
212336	212702	212329	212329	they	5111	" I remarked to Tom when I was done , and he laughed . And when upon leaving I demanded more pencils , he cackled wildly , and scrounged them up for me . * * * THE WILD SHORE 347 The days passed . The further I got in the story of the summer , the further away it was in time , and the less I understood it . Perplex'd in the extreme . One day it was raining and Pa and I both worked through the afternoon . We tried keeping the door open for light , but it was too cold even with the stove going , and rain kept blowing in when the wind shifted . We had to close it and light the lamps . Pa bent over the coat he was making . His hands moved as quickly as fingers snapping as he punched the holes , and yet the holes were perfectly spaced , in a line that could have been drawn by a straightedge . He slipped a thimble on his middle finger and stitched . Poke and pull , poke and pull ... cross - stitches appeared in perfect X 's , the thread tugged so that the tension on it was constant . ... I had never paid such close attention to his sewing . His calloused fingers clicked along as nimbly as dancers . It was as if Pa 's fingers were smarter than he was , I thought ; and I felt bad for thinking it . Besides , it was wrong . Pa told his fingers what to do , no one else . They would n't do it alone . It was truer to say something like , Pa 's sewing was the way in which he was smart . And in that way he was very smart indeed . I liked that way of saying it , and scribbled it down . Stitching thoughts . Meanwhile his deft fingers plied the needle , and it kept slipping through the pieces of cloth , pursing them together , pulling the thread taut , turning , piercing again . Pa sighed . “
212730	212784	212725	212725	I	0	” I clicked my tongue . It was annoying to be sitting in a dark box in the middle of the day , using up good lamp oil . In fact it was worse than annoying . I felt my spirits plunge as I took stock of the bare insides of our shack . “
212787	212793	212725	212725	I	0	" I muttered with disgust . “

212813	212864	212800	212800	I	0	" How could I explain it to him , without making him feel bad too ? He accepted our degraded conditions without a thought , always had . I shook my head . He peered at me curiously . Suddenly I had an idea . I jerked in my chair . “
212867	212874	212875	212875	I	0	” said Pa , watching me . “
212880	212892	212875	212875	I	0	” I got my boots on , put on my coat . “
212899	212908	212875	212875	I	0	” Pa said dubiously . 348 Kim Stanley Robinson "

212922	212940	212800	212800	I	0	" I turned from the open door , went back and punched him lightly on the arm . “
212952	213103	213104	213104	Rafe	292	" I crossed the bridge and went up Basilone to the Shankses ' , and kicked around in the piles of burnt wood . Sure enough , buried in soggy ash inside the north wall was a rectangular piece of glass , as wide as my outstretched arms , and nearly that tall . One of their many windows . A corner of it was very wavy near the bottom , and a little pocked - it looked like it had melted some in the fire — but I did n't care . I crowed at the sky , licked down raindrops , and very carefully returned to the valley , window held before me , dripping . Like a car 's windshield , eh ? I stopped and knocked on the door of Rafael 's shop . He was at home , black with grease and hammering like Vulcan . “
213120	213121	213104	213104	Rafe	292	” “
213124	213135	213104	213104	Rafe	292	” he said , and looked out at the rain . “
213143	213144	213136	213136	You	292	” “
213147	213148	213136	213136	You	292	” “
213169	213174	213175	213175	I	0	” Reluctantly I agreed . “
213189	213193	213179	213179	you	292	” he remarked . “
213202	213268	213179	213179	you	292	" I said happily , and was off . And two days later we had a window in our south wall , and the light streamed in over everything , turning every dust mote to silver . There was a lot of dust , too . We even had good windowsills , thanks to Rafael . He peered at the wavy part of the bottom . “
213280	213317	213179	213179	you	292	” He nodded his approval and left , toting his tools over his shoulder , whistling . Pa and I hopped around the house , cleaning up and staring out , going outside to stare in . “
213322	213330	213331	213331	Henry	284	” Pa said with a blissful smile : “
213352	213541	213341	213341	I	0	” We shook on it . I felt the strength in his right hand , and it sent a glow right through me . You got to have your father 's approval . I kept pumping his hand up and down till he started to laugh . It made me think of Steve . He never had that approval , THE WILD SHORE 349 never would have had it . It must have been like walking around with a thorn in your shoe . I feel it in my mind 's foot , Horatio . I began to think that I understood him more , at the same time I felt like I was losing him — the real , immediate Steve , I mean . I could only recall his face well in dreams , when it came back to me perfectly . And it was hard to get him down right in the book ; the way he could make you laugh , make you sure you were really living . I sat down to work on it , under the light of our new window . “
213552	213659	213542	213542	I	0	” Pa said , eyeing the window thoughtfully , measuring it in his mind . A while after that I joined the small group going to the last swap meet of the year . Winter swap meets were n't much like the summer ones ; there were fewer people there , and less stuff being traded . This time it was drizzling steadily , and everyone there was anxious to get their trading done and go home . Debates over prices quickly turned into arguments , and sometimes fights . The sheriffs had their hands full . Time after time I heard one of them bellowing , “
213676	213791	213792	213792	I	0	” I hurried from canopy to canopy , and in the shelter from the rain did my best to trade for some cloth or old clothing for Pa. All I had to offer were some abalone and a couple of baskets , and it was tough trading . One of the scavenger camps had gotten a fire going by pouring gas over the wet wood , and a lot of folks congregated under the canopy . I joined them , and after a bit I finally found a scavenger woman willing to trade a pile of ragged clothing for what I had . After we had counted it out piece for piece she said , “
213806	213807	213794	213794	you	5116	” “
213812	213836	213794	213794	you	5116	” I said , jerking slightly . She laughed , revealing a mouthful of busted brown stumps , and drank from a jar . “
213846	213847	213848	213848	I	0	” "
213852	213867	213794	213794	you	5116	” I said . She offered me the jar but I shook my head . “

213906	213948	213897	213897	they	345	" I felt the cold of that dim afternoon shiver into me , and I went from a crouch to sitting on my butt . I took the jar from 350 Kim Stanley Robinson her and drank some sour com mash . “
213959	213963	213955	213955	you	5122	" I said . “
213966	213974	213975	213978	the back country folks	5123	” she said , happy to gossip , "
213995	214004	213980	213980	you	5116	" I nodded so she 'd go on . “
214091	214133	214138	214138	you	0	" I took another gulp of her terrible liquor . It went to my stomach like a big lead sinker . Around us drizzle misted down through the trees , and bigger drops fell from the edge of the canopy . . “

214147	214320	214138	214138	you	0	” I bundled up the rags , thanked her and left , in a hurry to get back to Onofre and give Tom the news . Another rainy afternoon I sat in Rafael 's workshop , relaxing . I had told Tom what I had heard at the swap meet , and he had told John Nicolin and Rafael , and none of them had seemed overly concerned , which was a relief to me . Now the matter was out of my hands , and I was just passing the time . Kristen and Rebel sat crosslegged before Rafael 's set of double windows , making baskets and gossiping . Rafael sat on a short stool and tinkered with a battery . Tools and machine parts littered the stained floor , and around us stood products of Rafael 's invention and industry : pipes to carry a stove 's heat to another room , a small kiln , an electric generator connected to a bicycle on blocks , and so on . “
214326	214336	214138	214138	you	0	” Rafael said , answering a question of mine . “

214493	214510	214488	214488	I	0	” After a bit I shook my head to clear it , and changed the subject . “

214717	214721	214700	214700	You	284	” I blushed . “
214724	215122	214700	214700	You	284	” Rafael got up and rooted around in the big wall cupboard . I sat back lazily against the floor pillow behind me . Under the window Kristen and Rebel worked . The baskets they were weaving were made of old brown torrey pine needles , soaked in water so they were flexible again . Rebel took a needle and carefully bunched together the five individual slices of it , so that they made a neat cylinder . Then she curled the needle till it made a flat little wheel , and knotted several pieces of fishing line to it , splaying them out like spokes . Another pine needle was neatened up and tied around the outside of the first one . The first several needles were tied outside the ones before them , to make a flat bottom . Quickly it took two needles to make it around the circumference , then three . After that the nubs were set directly on top of each other , and the sides of the basket began to appear . I picked up a finished basket and inspected it while Rebel 352 Kim Stanley Robinson continued to whip the line around the needles . The basket was solid . Each needle looked like a miniature piece of rope , the five splits fit together so well . The four rows of nubs studding the sides of this particular basket rose in s shapes , showing just how much the basket bulged out and then back in . Such patience , arranging all the needles ! Such skill , whipping all of them into place ! I whapped the basket on the floor and it rebounded nicely , showing its flex and strength . Watching Rebel coax the line between two needles and through a complicated little loop of line waiting for it , it occurred to me that I had a task somewhat like hers . When I penciled in my book , I tied together words like she tied together pine needles , hoping to make a certain shape with them . Briefly I wished I could make a book as neat and solid and beautiful as the basket Rebel wove . But it was beyond hope , and I knew it . Rebel looked up and saw me watching her , and she laughed , embarrassed . “
215128	215212	214700	214700	You	284	" she said . Kristen nodded her agreement , a wet pine needle drooping from her teeth . Another day the clouds would have given us a few hours for fishing , but the seas were running so high it was impossible to get the boats out . When I was done writing I walked to the cliffs , and there was the old man , sitting on a shelf under the cliff 's lip , where he was protected from the wind . "
215215	215220	214700	214700	You	284	" I greeted him . “
215227	215228	215222	215222	you	5138	” “
215243	215244	215222	215222	you	5138	” “
215262	215268	215246	215246	you	5138	” I sat beside him . “
215277	215278	215246	215246	you	5138	” "
215285	215286	215246	215246	you	5138	" “
215295	215523	215550	215550	I	0	" . The swells were surging up from the south , breaking in giant walls that extended from one end of the beach to the other . The swells were visible far out to sea ; I could pick one out halfway to the horizon and follow it all the way in . Near the end they built up taller and taller , until they were gray cliffs rushing in to meet our tan one . A man standing at the foamy foot of one of those giants would have looked like a doll . When the towering top of a wave pitched out and the whole thing rolled over behind it , spray exploded in the air higher than the THE WILD SHORE 353 wave had stood , with a crack and a boom that distinctly vibrated the cliff under us . The tortured water dashed over itself in a boiling race to the beach . There floods of white water swept up the sand , and sucked back to crash into the next advance . Only a strip of sand against the cliff was left dry ; it would have been worth your life to walk the beach that day . Tom and I sat in a haze of white salt mist , and we had to talk over the explosive roar of the surf . “
215529	215536	215550	215550	I	0	" Tom shouted again and again . “
215553	215860	215550	215550	I	0	” Out beyond the swells the ocean stretched to the haze - fuzzed horizon . A low sheet of bumpy white and gray clouds covered the sky , barely clearing the hills behind us . Breaks in the clouds were marked by bright patches in the leaden surface of the water , and these patches made an uneven line to the horizon . They looked like the trail of a drunken scavenger with a hole in his pocket , scattering silver coins from here to the edge of the world . There was something about it all — the presence of that expanse of water , the size of it , the power of the waves - that made me stand back up and pace the cliff behind Tom 's back , stop and stare as a particularly monstrous sea cliff collapsed , shake my head in wonder or dismay , pace and turn again , slapping my thighs and trying to think of a way to say it , to Tom or anybody . I failed . The world pours in and overflows the heart till speech is useless , and that 's a fact . I wish I could speak better . I started to say things - spoke syllables and choked off the words — strode back and forth , getting more and more agitated as I tried to think exactly what it was I felt , and how I could then say that . It was impossible , and if I had really held out for precision I reckon I would have stood there staring at those sea avalanches all day , mute and amazed . But my mind shifted to another mystery , I struck my hand to my thigh , and Tom glanced at me curiously . I blurted out , “
215874	215880	215865	215865	you	351	” He cleared his throat . “
215890	215898	215865	215865	you	351	” I stood before him and stared . "
215902	215916	215865	215865	you	351	” He patted the sand beside him , but I refused to sit . “
215975	215976	215977	215977	You	351	" “
215997	215998	215977	215977	You	351	" "
216022	216079	216015	216015	I	0	“ But no ! No ! You also said the old time was awful . That we live better lives now than they ever did . That was what you said , when you argued with Doc and Leonard at the meets , and sometimes when you talked with us too . You told us that . "
216080	216083	216084	216084	he	351	" Well , "
216088	216145	216084	216084	he	351	“ there 's truth to that too . I was trying to tell you the way it was . I did n't lie — not much , I mean , and not about important things . Just once in a while to give you an idea what it was really like , what it felt like . "
216146	216155	216156	216156	I	0	“ But you told us two different things , "
216159	216211	216156	216156	I	0	" Two contradictory things . Onofre was primitive and degraded , but we were n't to want for the old time to come back either , because it was evil . We did n't have anything left that was ours , that we could be proud of . You confused us ! "
216221	216225	216226	216226	he	351	“ All right , "
216229	216240	216226	216226	he	351	“ Maybe I did . Maybe I made a mistake . "
216246	216267	216268	216268	Awkwardly	515	“ I ai n't some kind of great wise man , boy . I 'm just another fool like you . "
216359	216372	216373	216373	he	351	“ You know where I 'd like to be when I die ? ”
216376	216379	216373	216373	he	351	" No . "
216380	216392	216356	216356	he	351	“ I 'd like to be on top of Mount Whitney . "
216393	216396	216373	216373	he	351	" What ? "
216397	216486	216373	216373	he	351	“ Yeah . When I feel the end coming I 'd like to hike inland and up three - ninety - five , and then up to the top of Mount Whitney . It 's just a walk to the top , but it 's the tallest mountain in the United States . The second tallest , excuse me . There 's a little stone hut up there , and I could stay in that and watch the world till the end . Like the old Indians did . ”
216488	216491	216492	216492	I	0	“ Ah , ”
216495	216504	216492	216492	I	0	“ Sounds like a nice way to go . "
216692	216697	216703	216703	I	0	“ Gone to Whitney , "
216733	216745	216746	216746	I	0	“ You ca n't take off at this time of year , ”
216749	216765	216746	216746	I	0	“ There 'll be snow and ice and all . You 'll have to wait . "
216766	216774	216775	216775	We	5157	" I 'm not in any rush . "
216795	216806	216807	216807	I	0	“ I ca n't believe we did something that stupid , ”
216818	216823	216824	216824	he	5150	“ It was stupid , ”
216827	216852	216807	216807	I	0	“ You kids had the excuse of youth and bad teaching , but the Mayor and his men , why they were damned fools . "
216853	216861	216862	216862	I	0	“ But we ca n't give up , ”
216869	216884	216862	216862	I	0	" we ca n't just roll over and lie there like we 're dead . "
216885	216890	216891	216891	He	5150	“ That 's true . ”
216895	216908	216891	216891	He	5150	“ And maybe securing the land from intrusion is the first step . "
216914	216931	216909	216909	I	0	“ It ca n't be done . Not with what they have and what we have . "
216932	216947	216862	216862	I	0	“ Well ? I thought you said we do n't want to play possum ? ”
216948	216953	216954	216954	I	0	“ No , right . ”
216972	217053	216954	216954	I	0	“ I 'm saying we 've got to figure out some other way to resist , some way that will work . We either do something that works , or wait until we can . None of this shit in between . What I was thinking of was that all the towns that come to the swap meet , if they worked together , might be able to sail over and surprise Catalina . Take it over for a time . ”
217066	217074	217075	217075	I	0	“ For a while , I mean , "
217093	217117	217087	217087	I	0	“ With the radio equipment there we could tell the whole world we 're here , and we do n't like being quarantined . "
217118	217123	217056	217056	his	351	“ You think big . "
217124	217143	217056	217056	his	351	“ But it 's not impossible . Not someday , anyway , when we know more about Catalina . "
217144	217210	217087	217087	I	0	" It might not make any difference , you know . Broadcasting to the world , I mean . The world might be one big Finland now , and if it is all they 're going to be able to do is say , we hear you brother . We 're in the same boat . And then the Russians would sweep down on us . "
217211	217219	217220	217220	I	0	“ But it 's worth a try , "
217223	217252	217220	217220	I	0	“ Like you say , we do n't really know what 's going on in the world . And we wo n't until we try something like this . "
217262	217296	217255	217255	his	5159	“ That would cost a lot of lives , you know . Lives like Mando 's — people who could have lived their full span to make things better in our new towns . ”
217297	217302	217303	217303	I	0	“ Their full spans , "
217377	217408	217366	217366	he	5159	“ Do n't fret about it , Henry . We 're Americans , it ai n't been clear what we 're supposed to do for a long , long time . ”
217430	217435	217436	217436	I	0	“ I guess not , ”
217440	217449	217436	217436	I	0	“ Not since Shakespeare 's time , eh ? ”
217450	217455	217456	217456	He	5159	" Harumph - hmm ! ”
217481	217488	217489	217489	he	5159	“ Um , by the way , ”
217497	217530	217489	217489	he	5159	" while we 're on the subject of history lessons , and , um , lies , I should make a correction . Well ! Um ... Shakespeare was n't an American . "
217531	217536	217537	217537	I	0	" Oh , no , "
217540	217545	217489	217489	he	5159	“ You 're kidding . "
217546	217550	217489	217489	he	5159	“ No . Um- ”
217551	217557	217489	217489	he	5159	“ But what about England ? ”
217558	217572	217489	217489	he	5159	“ Well , it was n't the leader of the first thirteen states . ”
217573	217582	217489	217489	he	5159	“ But you showed me on a map ! "
217587	217598	217599	217599	I	0	“ That was Martha 's Vineyard , I 'm afraid . "
217651	217660	217642	217642	he	351	“ Looks like John , does n't it ? "
217920	217929	217930	217930	he	278	“ Glad to see you 're doing better , ”
217939	217954	217930	217930	he	278	“ Thanks . I 'm feeling fine . Good to be up and around . ”
217962	217970	217971	217971	John	278	“ Magnificent day , ai n't it ? ”
217974	217982	217971	217971	John	278	“ I do n't like the swell . "
218002	218014	218015	218015	Tom	351	“ I have n't seen you in the last couple days , "
218018	218036	218015	218015	Tom	351	“ I went by your house to say hello , and Mrs. N. said you were gone . "
218037	218042	218043	218043	John	278	“ That 's right , ”
218055	218088	218046	218046	He	278	“ I wanted to talk to you about that . Henry , you too . I went down to take a look at those railroad tracks the San Diegans have been using . "
218097	218101	218089	218089	Tom	351	" How come ? ”
218102	218270	218043	218043	John	278	“ Well , from what Gabby Mendez says , it appears they used 358 Kim Stanley Robinson our boys as a cover for their retreat after the ambush . And now it turns out that mayor got killed . I went and asked some of my Pendleton friends about it , and they say it 's true . They say there 's a real fight going on right now down there , between three or four groups who want the power that the mayor had . That in itself sounds bad , and if the wrong group ends up on top , we could be in trouble . So Rafe and I were thinking that the railroad tracks should be wrecked for good . I went down to look at that first river crossing , and it 's pretty clear Rafe could destroy the pilings with the explosives he 's got . And he says he can blast the track every hundred yards or so , easy . "
218271	218274	218276	218276	Tom	351	" Wow , "
218281	218356	218278	218278	John	278	“ It 's drastic , but I think it 's the right move . If you ask me , those folks down there are crazy . Anyway , I wanted to know what you thought of the idea . I was going to just get Rafe and go do it , but ... But it would have been too much like what Steve and I had done . Tom cleared his throat , said , “
218368	218369	218370	218370	I	0	” "
218385	218386	218382	218382	you	351	" "
218395	218399	218387	218387	I	0	” Tom said . “
218428	218435	218437	218437	you	351	” John nodded , looking satisfied . “
218441	218447	218448	218448	I	0	” That took me aback . “
218468	218479	218495	218495	I	0	” I added ( John 's eyes had narrowed ) , “
218500	218501	218495	218495	I	0	" “
218504	218508	218495	218495	I	0	” said John . “
218537	218538	218495	218495	I	0	" “
218545	218549	218495	218495	I	0	" Tom said . “
218584	218585	218580	218582	the San Diegans	345	” “
218588	218604	218580	218582	the San Diegans	345	" John said . I felt myself blushing . John glanced at me and said , "
218611	218620	218621	218621	You	5179	" I scratched the sandstone with a pebble . “
218633	218634	218624	218624	I	0	” "
218637	218647	218624	218624	I	0	" He straightened up , chewed his lower lip . “
218663	218671	218657	218657	his	351	" His voice tensed , pitched higher . “
218705	218716	218694	218694	he	5183	” He shrugged it off , looked at me sullenly . “
218732	218783	218727	218727	I	0	” I shook my head , though part of me had been thinking that . And it was true , in a way . But not entirely . I could n't make it clear , even to myself . John shifted his gaze to Tom , but Tom only shrugged . “
218859	218860	218853	218853	They	5192	” “
218863	218974	218853	218853	They	5192	" John said , mouth tight . He was n't convinced , even if it absolved him , even if he had been saying the same thing a second ago . John was always going to believe his own actions had effects . And with his own son , who 'd spent a lifetime in his care ... I could read his face thinking of that as clear as you can read the face of a babe . A wave of pain crossed his features , and he shook himself , and with a somber click of tongue against teeth reminded himself that we were here . He closed up . “
218981	218985	218986	218986	I	0	” he said . “
219000	219149	218986	218986	I	0	” So the matter was closed . I thought about how this conversation would have taken place at the ovens among the women : the chewing over every detail of event and motivation , the arguing it out , the yelling and crying and all ; and I almost laughed . We men were a pretty tight - lipped crowd when it came to important things . John was walking in a circle like I had earlier , and quickly his nervous striding got to us , so that Tom and I stood to stretch out . Pretty soon the three of us were meandering in place like gulls , hands in pockets , observing the swells and pointing out to each other any particularly big ones . Looking back at the valley , now filled with trees yellow among the evergreens , I stopped pacing and said , “
219184	219188	219191	219191	them	5196	” Tom said , “
219196	219207	219191	219191	them	5196	” He and John stopped walking to listen to me . “
219260	219261	219303	219303	you	5203	" “
219274	219278	219303	219303	you	5203	" Tom commented . “
219286	219294	219303	219303	you	5203	” I corrected him . He grinned . “
219322	219323	219324	219324	I	0	" “
219333	219337	219324	219324	I	0	" John admitted . "
219350	219355	219356	219356	I	0	” he added dubiously . "
219363	219367	219368	219368	He	292	" I said . "
219410	219411	219412	219412	He	292	” “
219415	219420	219412	219412	He	292	” ' Tom said . “
219473	219492	219465	219465	he	292	" John and Tom looked at each other , sharing something I could n't read . John nodded . “
219526	219554	219571	219571	You	5205	” Another huge set rolled in , washing all the way to the base of the cliff , and our attention was forced back to the waves . “
219566	219570	219571	219571	You	5205	" Tom repeated . “
219575	219579	219580	219580	I	0	” said John . “

219615	219635	219571	219571	You	5205	" It was true . John mentioned that he wanted to get the boats out on days like this . “
219648	219652	219637	219637	you	5205	" I said . "
219665	219666	219580	219580	I	0	" “
219670	219674	219580	219580	I	0	" Tom cried . “
219683	219688	219580	219580	I	0	" I pointed out . “
219701	219702	219703	219703	You	5205	" “
219717	219721	219703	219703	You	5205	" Tom said . “
219724	219739	219740	219740	You	5205	” said John reluctantly — with perhaps a gleam of humor in his eye . "
219745	219790	219740	219740	You	5205	" THE WILD SHORE 361 We meandered around our shelf again , talked about currents and the possibility of a mild winter . Out to sea shafts of light still speared the clouds to gild the lined ocean surface . Tom pointed out there . “
219808	219814	219802	219802	They	5209	” John and I groaned . “
219855	219859	219865	219865	he	292	" John said , “
219882	219883	219865	219865	he	292	" “

219958	219976	219935	219935	we	5211	” John told me . But I was remembering the time Steve and I had discussed it . “
220001	220002	219935	219935	we	5211	” “
220007	220015	219935	219935	we	5211	” John said , cocking his head . “
220036	220040	220025	220025	we	5211	" said Tom . “
220057	220059	220025	220025	we	5211	" . "
220069	220088	220061	220061	we	5211	" John said . But he liked the idea ; what was it but fishing , after all ? “
220105	220106	220090	220090	you	5214	” “
220109	220487	220090	220090	you	5214	" Tom said . He knelt and picked up a pebble to draw in the dirt . He started to scratch a plan , and John crouched at his side . I looked out at the horizon , and this is what I saw : three sunbeams standing like thick white pillars , slanting each its own way , measuring the distance between the grey clouds and the gray sea . Chapter the Last As the year fell away to its death the storms came more frequently , until every week or so one barreled in over the whitecaps and thrashed us , leaving the valley tạttered and the sea a foamy pale brown from all the dirt sluiced into it . When we did get the boats out the fishing was miserably cold , and we did n't catch much . Most days I spent at the table under the window , where I read or wrote or watched black clouds bluster in . The clouds were the vanguard ; after them a smack of the wind 's hand , and maybe a low rumble of thunder , announced the arrival of the storm 's main force . Raindrops slid down the windowpane in a thousand tributaries that met and divided again and again as they wandered down the glass . The roof ticked or tapped or drummed under the onslaught . Behind me Pa labored away on his new sewing machine , and its rn , rn , rn rn rnnnn ! rebuked my idleness , sometimes so successfully that I buckled down and wrote a sentence or two . But it was hard going , and there were lots of hours when I was content to chew my pencils ( writing epics on my teeth ) and think about 363 364 Kim Stanley Robinson it , and watch it rain , lulled by wind , and roof patter , and the tea kettle 's whistle , and Pa 's mn rn , snip snip . The first storm of December , it snowed . It was a real pleasure to sit in our warm house and look out the window at the flakes drifting silently through the trees . Pa looked over my shoulder . “
220497	221318	220090	220090	you	5214	” I did n't agree . We had enough food , even if it was fish , and more firewood was being dried in the bathhouse every day . After all the rain I was happy to see snow just for the way it looked , for the way it fell!-so slowly it did n't seem real , at first . Then to run outside , and hop white drifts , and slap snowballs together to throw at neighbors .... I loved the snow . The day after , the sun came out under a high pale blue sky ( fishbone clouds smack against the highest part of it ) , and the snow melted before midday . But the next storm brought more snow , and colder air , and a thicker tail of high clouds , and it was four days before the harsh sun came out and the white dusting melted and ran into the river . That got to be the pattern : valley first white - green under black skies , then black - green under white skies . Week by week it got colder . Week by week my story got harder to write . I got lost in it - I stopped believing it - I wrote chapters and had to take a walk over the soggy leaf carpets in the woods , distressed and angry at myself . Still , I wrote it . The solstice passed , and Christmas passed , and New Year 's passed , and I went to all the parties and such , but it was like I was in fog , and afterwards I could n't remember who I had talked to or what I had said . The book was the only thing for me — and yet it was so hard ! Sometimes I wore out pencils faster biting than writing . But the day came when the tale was on the page , pretty much . All the action done , Mando and Steve gone . I stopped then , and took one still day to read what I had said . It made me so mad I damn near burned the thing . Here all those things had happened , they had changed us for life , and yet the miserable string of words sitting on the table did n't hold the half of it — the way it had looked , the thoughts it had engendered , the way I felt about it all . It was like pissing to show what a storm is like . Why , there was no more of last summer in that book than there is of the tree in an old scrap of driftwood . And the work I had put in on it — well , it was discouraging . I went out for a walk to try and recover . A few tall white clouds sailed above like galleons , but mostly it was a sunny THE WILD SHORE 365 day , and dead still , though the air had a bite to it . Wet snow lay on everything . Cakes of it were balanced on every branch , dripping and sparking the various colors of the rainbow . On the ground the snow crumbled to big clear grains under the sun 's glare , and the grains turned to drops of water that beaded the white blanket . Suncones melted through to tufts of grass , and snowbridges over the streams filling the paths collapsed , leaving dirty chunks of ice in the mud , and snow hummocks to each side , black with pine needles . I walked between these hummocks and over the remaining bridges ( the ones in shadow ) to the cliffs , thumping my boots in puddles and knocking snowcakes on branches into mush and spray . Out on the point of the cliff overlooking the river I sat down . No swell whatsoever ; tiny waves lapped the strand as if the whole ocean was shifting a hand 's breadth up and down . There was n't any snow left on the beach , but it was wet and bedraggled , with blue - and - white puddles dotting it everywhere . The scattered galleon clouds did n't hinder the sun much , but gave its light a tint so that the long stretch of cliff was the color of ironwood bark . No swell , still air , the ocean like a plate of blue glass , the galleons hovering over it , holding their positions . I noticed something I had never seen before , On the flat blue sea were perfect reflections of the tall clouds , clearly shaped so you could tell they were upside down . It looked like they were floating underwater , in a dark blue sky . “
221325	221743	221320	221320	you	5217	” I said aloud , and stood . Ever so slowly the clouds drifted onshore over the valley , and their upside - down twins disappeared under the beach . I stayed and watched that all day , feeling like oceans of clouds were filling me . Later the afternoon onshore breeze ruffled the mirror clouds , and the sun got too low and glared off the water . But I went home satisfied . In the winter the scavengers hole up in some of the big , shattered old houses - a dozen or more of them to a house , like dens of foxes . At night they use the neighboring houses for firewood , and light big bonfires in the front yards , and they drink and dance to old music , and fight and howl and throw jewelry at the stars and into the snow . A solitary man , gliding over the drifts on long snowshoes , can move amongst these bright noisy settlements without trouble . He can crouch out in the trees like a wolf , and watch them cavort in their colored 366 Kim Stanley Robinson down jackets for as long as he likes , undisturbed . Their summer haunts are open to his inspection . And there are books up there , yes , lots of books . The scavengers like the little fat one with the orange sun on the cover , but many more lie unattended in the ruins around them- whole libraries , sometimes . A man can load himself down till his snowshoes sink knee - deep , and then return , a scavenger of a different sort , to his own country , his own winter den . At the end of January a particularly violent storm undermined the side of the Mendez 's garden shed ( they called it a barn ) , and as soon as the rain stopped all the immediate neighbors — the Marianis , the Simpsons , and Pa and I , with Rafael called in for advice - got out to give them a hand in shoring up that wall . The Mendez garden was as cold and muddy as the ocean floor , and there was n't a patch of solid ground to set beams on , to prop up the wall while we worked under it . Eventually Rafael got us to tie the shed to the big oak on the other side of it . “
221753	221843	221744	221744	I	0	” Rafael joked when we were back under the sagging wall . Kathryn and I worked one side , Gabby and Del dug out the other , and we practically drowned in mud . By the time we got beams set crosswise under the wall for foundations , all four families were ready for the bathhouse . Rafael had gone before us , so when we got there the fire was blazing and the water steamed . We stripped and hopped in the dirt bath and hooted with glee . “
221853	221860	221847	221847	you	5218	” Rafael said to old Mendez . “
221880	221945	221946	221946	You	5219	” Mendez was n't amused . I rolled over into the clean bath and floated with him and Mrs. Mariani and the others . Kathryn and I sat on one of the wood islands and talked . She asked me if I was still writing . I told her I was nearly done , but that I 'd stopped because it was so bad . "
221953	221957	221946	221946	You	5219	” she said . “
221961	221962	221965	221965	I	0	" “
221968	222001	222002	222002	I	0	" We talked about the storms , the snow , the condition of the fields ( they were under tarps for the winter ) , the swells battering the beach , food . “
222009	222013	222014	222014	Tom	351	” I said . “
222029	222030	222021	222021	They	5220	” “
222033	222039	222021	222021	They	5220	” Kathryn shook her head . “
222054	222060	222061	222061	He	287	” She looked at me . “
222067	222068	222061	222061	He	287	" “
222071	222093	222061	222061	He	287	” I did n't know what to say . After a long pause looking at the swirling water , I said , “
222101	222102	222095	222095	you	5219	" "
222105	222110	222095	222095	you	5219	” She eyed me . “
222115	222116	222113	222113	you	5219	” “
222128	222145	222146	222146	You	5219	" Under my reproachful gaze she shrugged , and her nipples bobbed on the bubbling surface . “
222174	222201	222163	222163	Henry	284	" I told her about the day when the sea had been so glassy that it mirrored the clouds , and she sat back and laughed . “
222206	222207	222163	222163	Henry	284	” “
222221	222274	222275	222275	Henry	284	" She reached over the wood island , and ran a finger down the crease between the muscles of the backside of my arm . I arched my eyebrows , and with a grin slipped off the seat to float around and tussle with her . She caught me by the hair . “
222277	222319	222275	222275	Henry	284	” she laughed , and held my head under , giving me more immediate matters to think about , like choking on water and drowning . I came up spluttering . She laughed again and gestured at the friends around us . “
222322	222717	222718	222718	Henry	284	” I said , and went under for a submerged approach , but she stood and sloshed away , leading me to the wall seats where the others were . After that we talked with Gabby and Kristen , and later old Mendez , who thanked us for our help with his barn . But when Rafael declared the day 's allotment of wood was burned , and we got out of the baths and dried off , and dressed , I looked around the room , and there was Kathryn looking at me from the door . I followed her out . The evening air chilled . my head and hands instantly . There was Kathryn , on the path between two trees . I caught up with her and took her in a hug . We kissed . There are kisses that have a whole future in them ; I learned that then . When we were done her mother and sisters were chattering out the bathhouse door . I let her go . She looked surprised , thoughtful , pleased . If it had been summer — but it was winter , there was snow everywhere . And summer was coming . She smiled at me , and with a touch walked off to join them , looking back once to meet my gaze . When she was out of sight I walked home through the dusk ( white snow , black trees ) with a whole new idea in mind . Some afternoons I just sat before the window and looked at the book — left it closed , in the middle of the table , and 368 Kim Stanley Robinson stared at it . One of these times the snowflakes were drifting down through the trees as slowly as tufts of dandelion , and every branch and needle was tipped with new white . Into this vision tramped a figure on snowshoes , wearing furs . He had a pole in each hand to help his balance , and as he brushed between trees he sent little avalanches onto his head and down his back . The old man , out trapping , I thought . But he hiked right up to the window and waved . I slipped on my shoes and went outside . It was cold . "
222720	222724	222718	222718	Henry	284	" Tom called . “
222729	222738	222739	222739	I	0	" I said as I rounded our house . "
222788	222789	222780	222780	he	517	" “
222795	222800	222780	222780	he	517	” I said politely . “
222838	222839	222825	222825	He	517	” "
222843	222883	222825	222825	He	517	" The new mayor of San Diego is Lee . Neville said that Lee was always in trouble with that Danforth , because he would n't go along with any of Danforth 's war plans , you know . ' “
222893	222894	222891	222891	him	517	” "
222962	222963	222959	222959	Lee	518	” "
222971	222984	222959	222959	Lee	518	” We stared at each other , and I found myself grinning . “
222994	222998	222959	222959	Lee	518	" He nodded . “
223006	223007	222959	222959	Lee	518	” “
223017	223018	223019	223019	I	0	” “
223041	223048	223067	223067	he	0	Well”—he waved one of his poles overhead -“Lousy
