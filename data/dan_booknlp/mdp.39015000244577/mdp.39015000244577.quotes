937	1028	932	932	me	0	” Dolly had heard her talking with Luciente : therefore he existed . Or Dolly had heard her talking to herself . Dolly had said the chair was warm : she had been sitting in the other chair , in front of the plate from her supper of eggs and beans . She must not think about it now , with Dolly suffering . His story was unbelievable ! No , do n't think about it . She wrapped ice cubes in a kitchen towel and brought them to Dolly . “
1037	1133	1134	1134	Consuleo	310	" Not that she had taken the tranquilizers . She had sold the pills for a little extra money , for a piece of pork or chicken once a week , soap to wash with . She found it hard to believe anybody would take that poison intentionally , but you could peddle any kind of pill in El Barrio . Still , there had been the nuisance of going down to Bellevue , since she had been living near Dolly 's when she had been sent away and never could get her case transferred . "

1264	1376	1259	1259	I	0	” As she supported her niece 's weight into the bedroom she felt a flash of fear or perhaps of hope that Luciente would still be there . But the tiny room held only her swaybacked bed , the chair with her alarm clock on it , the dresser , the wine jug full of dried flowers , the airshaft window incompletely covered with old curtains from better days . She undressed Dolly tenderly as a baby , but her niece groaned and cursed and wept more . The satin polka dot shirt was streaked with blood and blood had soaked through her black satin brassiere with the nipples cut out . “
1387	1422	1423	1423	Mira	312	” Connie promised as Dolly mourned her clothes , her body , her skin . Bruises had already clotted under the velvety skin of Dolly 's belly , her soft arms , her collarbone . “

2476	2510	2470	2470	Slick	314	” Geraldo leaned on the doorframe , lighting a cigarette and dropping the lit match on the floor , where it slowly burned out , making a black hole in the worn linoleum . "

2694	2984	2684	2684	You	307	" Geraldo had taken Dolly with him on vacation . Connie 13 felt pretty sure Dolly had tried to get pregnant , believing that Geraldo would let her quit whoring . Dolly wanted to have another baby and stay home . Like figures of paper , like a manger scene of pasteboard figures , a fantasy had shone in Connie since her conversation with Dolly that morning : she and Dolly and Dolly 's children would live together . She would have a family again , finally . She would be ever so careful and good and she would do anything , anything at all to keep them together . She would never be jealous of her niece no matter how many boyfriends she had . Dolly could stay out all night and go off on weekends and to Florida even and she would stay with Nita and the baby . As if anyone would ever again leave her alone with a child . The dream was like those paper dolls , the only dolls she had had as a child , dolls with blond paper hair and Anglo features , and big paper smiles . That she knew in her heart of ashes the dream was futile did not make it less precious . Every soul needs a little sweetness . She thought of the stalks of sugar cane the kids bought at the fruit and vegetable man . Sweet in the mouth as you chewed it , and then you spat out the husks and they lay in the street . Hollow , flimsy , for a moment sweet in the mouth . Cane with which her grandmother had sweetened the chocolate long ago in El Paso . "
2991	3298	3299	3299	Fíjate	317	” Geraldo shouted at her and she jumped to put out the flame . The coffee she had never finished making . The kettle had boiled almost dry . She shut off the oven and the burners because now her two small rooms felt stifling hot . How she had jumped to the stove when he rapped out that curt command . She resented obeying him automatically , instinctively jerking at the loud masculine order . His beauty only made him more hateful . His face with the big gray eyes , the broad nose , the full cruel mouth , the hands like long talons , the proud bearing - he was the man who had pimped her favorite niece , her baby , the pimp who had beaten Dolly and sold her to pigs to empty themselves in . Who robbed Dolly and slapped her daughter Nita and took away the money squeezed out of the pollution of Dolly 's flesh to buy lizard boots and cocaine and other women . Geraldo was her father , who had beaten her every week of her childhood . Her second husband , who had sent her into emergency with 14 blood running down her legs . He was El Muro , who had raped her and then beaten her because she would not lie and say she had enjoyed it . She had had the strength then to run , to cut her losses and run . On the evening bus the next day she had left her home in Chicago , her father and sisters , the graves of her mother and her first ( her real ) husband , Martín . Dolly lacked the coarse strength that had saved her that time . But Dolly had Nita already and a baby in the oven . "
3303	3307	3299	3299	Fíjate	317	" she screamed . “
3357	3413	3414	3414	Puta	318	” Pivoting , Geraldo cuffed her back into the stove . The hot metal seared her back in a broad line and she clamped her lips tight , unable to scream , unable to issue a sound from the suddenness of the pain . She sank to the floor and could not speak or move . “
3442	3443	3428	3428	him	319	" “
3448	3537	3428	3428	him	319	” Dolly was thrashing around in bed , screaming and sobbing . Geraldo stepped into the bedroom , out of Connie 's line of sight . She tried to roll to her feet . The scrawny doctor sat on the edge of a kitchen chair . He was in his fifties . His clothes were new and conservative , his manner was tense , and his foot tapped , tapped . Slick was leaning against the outer door smoking a joint and grinning . Connie asked in Spanish , “
3544	3545	3538	3538	You	0	” "
3549	3571	3538	3538	You	0	" He did not look at her but replied as softly as she spoke . At his accent her eyes narrowed . “
3578	3589	3574	3574	you	0	” She rolled on one elbow and tried to rise . “

3732	4922	3719	3720	her father	4633	" Dolly let out a long , terrified wail that scraped on the inside of Connie 's skull . She had not heard such a desperate scream since she had been in the bughouse . Geraldo called Dr. Medias . Medias rose slowly to his feet and fumbled for a bag he had set beside the chair . Connie pulled herself up by the table leg , kicked him as hard as she could in the shin , and ran into the bedroom . She must stop them ! Dolly 's mouth was bleeding again . Blood ran over the tattered nightgown Connie had dressed her in , onto the pillow . Dolly was trying to thrash free of Geraldo , who held her pinned . He would kill her ! With his treachery he would kill Dolly and her baby too . Dolly would bleed to death in that bed . Connie seized a bottle from the corner , the wine bottle that had once contained a half gallon of California burgundy and now held dried flowers and grasses , from a rare picnic with Dolly , Nita , Luis ( Dolly 's father and her brother ) and his current family . With the nostalgic grasses scattering , she waved the jug and ran at Geraldo . He did not let go of Dolly quickly enough to defend himself . She smashed the wine jug right into his face . His nose flattened like a squashed bug on a windshield . He fell back against the wall , bellowing rage in no language . She raised the jug to hit him again , but her arms were caught behind her . She twisted . Someone struck her hard in the nape and she tried to turn . The fist caught her again and she went out . She lay tied with straps to a bed , staring up at a bare bulb , shot up with meds . Thorazine ? It felt worse , heavier . A massive dose . Hospital tranks hit her like a bulldozer when she had taken nothing for a long time . Prolixin ? Whenever she sank into unconsciousness , she was tortured by clamps on her hips , her breasts , she was trapped in her old Chicago flat in a fire . The flames licked her skin . Her lungs filled with choking smoke . She tried and tried to pull clear of something that had fallen on her , to escape . She could not move . Her body ached . All of her ached . Geraldo and his carnal Slick had beaten her twice : once right after she 16 had broken Geraldo 's nose , and again on the way to Bellevue in his car . Her ribs hurt terribly on the right side and she suspected one or two might be broken . Probably Geraldo had kicked her as she lay on the floor . In the car she had come to and he had begun punching her again in the face and chest and arms . He had beaten her until Dolly begged him to stop and began to weep and threatened to jump out of the car . Each breath she drew stabbed her . How could she get the hospital to X - ray her for a broken rib ? So far no one had heard a word she said , which of course was not unusual . Geraldo was so damned smart - bringing her to Bellevue , for instance , instead of to Met , on Ninety - sixth . Bellevue had records on her from before . He pretended she had attacked him and Dolly at Dolly 's apartment on Rivington . He would take no chance that they might not accept her as a crazy woman . The doctor had not even interviewed her but had talked exclusively to Geraldo , exchanging only a word or two with Dolly . Geraldo had Dolly gripped by the elbow , her face still swollen . Dolly had lied . Dolly had sold her into Bellevue , and for what ? For her own skin , already polluted ? For the nose of her precious pimp ? For the opportunity to fuck more johns ? How could Dolly sit there sniveling and nod when the doctor asked if Connie had done that to her face ? Connie writhed on the bed , pinned down with just enough play to let her wriggle . They had pushed her into restraint , shot her up immediately . She had been screaming- okay ! Did they think you had to be crazy to protest being locked up ? Yes , they did . They said reluctance to be hospitalized was a sign of sickness , assuming you were sick , in one of these no - win circles . The last time she had not fought ; she had come willingly with the caseworker , believing in her sickness . She had come humbly , rotten with self - hatred and weary of her life . Her left calf began to cramp . She wanted to shriek'with the sharp pain . She longed to knead the calf in her hands . The hard ball of muscle formed and held rigid . If she screamed they might never release her from restraint . They had forgotten her , locked her away in this broom closet to starve . She had pissed on herself . What could she do ? Now she lay in her own wet stink . Cold at first , creepy cold , now warm from her body . And stinking . She turned her head , craning to watch the slit in the door . Wide and low , like a mouth . If only she saw an attendant look in , she could signal . Her back festered between her shoulder blades , where it had been burned by the stove . The two attendants had put her neatly into restraint , the injection entering her veins like molten lead . Folding a sheet warm from the machine in the laundry room - flip , flip , bang , fold . Already the processing had begun . The attendant at check - in had held by one corner her worn red plastic purse mended with tape , held it like something dirty , a piece of garbage from the streets . Casually the woman arrayed her fragile possessions on the counter and , with a gesture like emptying an ashtray , dropped them into an envelope and locked them away . Her purse , her keys , her scrap of brown paper on which she had been figuring April 's budget , her rent receipt , the ballpoint pen with the name of a stationery company that she had found in the subway , her black plastic comb , her old loved compact with the raised peacock figure that Claud had given her for her birthday , selecting with his sensitive fingers the “
4924	5344	3719	3720	her father	4633	” of the design , her dime store red lipstick that she wore only for best against the day when it would be used up and she would lack the money for another — unless Dolly gave her a lipstick . Dolly ! Who had betrayed her . Who had abandoned her . Who had sold her into bondage . At the desk her counters of identity had been taken : welfare ID , Medicaid , old library card , photos of Dolly with Nita , of Angelina as a baby , at one held by her father , Eddie , at two with herself , at three holding Claud 's hand with that grin like a canoe - the way she had drawn mouths . There were no pictures of Angelina at four , or afterward . Through some bond of blood like a ghostly umbilical cord , could Angelina in Larchmont or Scarsdale feel her mother on the rack ? Her back hurt so , her calf ached , her face throbbed , her rib stabbed her as she breathed , her shoulder was wounded where Geraldo had twisted her arm in the back seat of the car until she had thought it would snap . Her tongue was swollen and her mouth full of blood as Dolly 's had been . A foul taste : herself . The smell of her own piss rose into her nostrils . She began to weep . Then she choked on her tears and stopped in panic , She could not wipe her nose . The tears ran into her mouth . She was trussed like a holiday bird for the oven . 18 That doctor . What was his name ? Youngish , with fine thin brown hair worn straggling , not quite long , not quite short , he kept yawning and trying to suppress the yawns so that his jaw muscles flexed strangely as he questioned Geraldo and wrote entries on a record form . Geraldo was almost demure . He had a good manner with authority , as any proper pimp should , respectful but confident . Man to man , pimp and doctor discussed her condition , while Dolly sobbed . The doctor asked her only her name and the date . First she said it was the fourteenth and then she changed it to the fifteenth , thinking it must be after midnight . She had no idea how long she had been unconscious . “
5379	5492	5375	5375	He	834	” The doctor went on making notations on the form . She was a body checked into the morgue ; meat registered for the scales . She tried to tell the nurse who gave her the injection , the attendants who tied her to the stretcher , that she was innocent , that she had a broken . rib , that Geraldo had beaten her . It was as if she spoke another language , that language Claud 's buddy had been learning that nobody else knew : Yoruba . They acted as if they could n't hear you . If you complained , they took it as a sign of sickness . "
5510	5567	5501	5502	the patient	836	” She had heard a doctor say that to a resident , teaching him not to listen to patients . She had been through that last time in , when she had had a toothache . It had developed into a full abscess before the nurse and the attendants stopped interpreting her complaints as part of her “
5573	6020	5501	5502	the patient	836	" Fool , poor fool she had got herself locked away again . She had jumped into the fire . Why had she done it ? Why ? Yet lying in enforced contemplation , she found that clean anger glowing in her still . She hated Geraldo and it was right for her to hate him . Attacking him was different from turning her anger , her sorrow , her loss of Claud into self - hatred , into speed and downers , into booze , into wine , into seeing herself in Angelina and abusing that self born again into the dirty world . Yes , this time was different . She had struck out not at herself , not at herself 19 in another , but at Geraldo , the enemy . She had not been wrong to try to defend Dolly , her closest one now , her blood , her almost child . How could she allow Geraldo to carve up Dolly 's body ? She had smashed his nose , yes ; for all her pain , she smiled as she saw that moment . She had smashed his nose and he would never look quite the same . Last time in she had accepted the doom of sickness ; the weight of the heavy judgment they passed out here she had bowed to . This time she was not ashamed . She would get out fast . She would be clearly competent , sane , together . How long did she lie strapped to the bed ? Day was the same as night . They had forgotten her and she would die here in her own piss . Sometimes she could not stand it anymore and she yelled as loud as she could and begged the walls to open . Moments were forever . She was mad . The drugs made her mind strange . She was caught , she was stalled . She floated trapped like an embryo in alcohol , that awful thing the Right to Life people had in that van on the street . She was caught in a moment that had fallen out of time and would never be over , never be done . She was mad . Yes , now she was crazy . How could she doubt it , lying wet in her own piss while her body screamed and the drug thickened her to lead . Sometimes she slipped down into a hot , muggy doze and sometimes the pain from her back or her rib or her mouth tore through her sleep and she woke wild with grief and wept . "
6037	6142	6033	6033	Someone	4649	" No response came . That was madness . To weep and cry out and curse and scream , and It was as if she had done nothing . She was dozing in that feverish half - sleep without rest or relief , when the door banged open . Two attendants came in and untied her . She pitched forward , weak as string . She could see in their faces disgust , boredom . She smelled bad . She stank ! They hauled her along the hall like a bag of garbage and they paid no attention to what she tried to say . “
6171	6172	6174	6174	I	0	" "
6198	6215	6186	6186	Yon	838	” The woman was a husky dyed blond who spoke with a slight Middle European accent . “
6241	6242	6236	6236	you	838	" “
6250	6264	6236	6236	you	838	" The other woman was six 20 feet tall , hefty and black . "
6286	6287	6279	6279	We	843	" "
6329	6330	6321	6321	him	845	" "
6333	6344	6321	6321	him	845	” The black woman wore a bland , noncommittal look . “
6355	6373	6321	6321	him	845	" she - said to Connie from over her head . They began pulling her clothes off . "
6379	6380	6374	6374	I	0	” "
6404	6405	6396	6396	she	847	" “
6418	6423	6424	6424	He	848	" she added quickly . “
6438	6439	6432	6432	him	848	" “
6447	6465	6443	6443	you	0	” the black attendant wondered , shoving her into the shower like a dog to be bathed . “
6473	6474	6475	6475	She	847	" "
6504	6510	6512	6512	she	847	" the blond said loftily . "
6528	7264	6525	6525	them	851	" She wanted to scream that she washed as often as they did , that they had made her smell , made her dirty herself . But she did not dare . First , they would not listen , and second , they might hurt her . Who would care ? Because her clothes were filthy , they gave her a pair of blue pajamas three sizes too big and a robe of no particular color . Rotten luck to have been shoved into restraint on arrival . If she had simply walked up to the ward , she would have been able to keep her street clothes and more things . Here a scrap of paper , a book , a handkerchief , a , nubbin of pencil , a bobby - pin were precious beyond imagining outside , irreplaceable treasures . She found herself walking strangely , not only from the bruises : ah , the old Thorazine shuffle . She could no longer move quickly , gracefully , in spite of her plumpness . The black attendant walked her into the day room , a big bleak room between the men 's and the women 's sides of the ward , right by the locked door to the hall and the elevators . She looked around slowly . She caught sight of a clock on the way in and she knew it was eleven in the morning . She was not hungry although she had not eaten for a long time . The drug killed her appetite so that she felt hollow , weak , but not hungry . The rib stabbed her . She felt feverish and might be . Nothing she could do . Her only hope was to catch a doctor as he made his flight through the ward or to persuade one of the attendants that she really needed medical help . Then the attendant would tell the doctor . It would take days to reach that kind of relationship with an attendant , and in the meantime she could die . How hot the ward was . Steam heat from the old radiators turned on full blast . She fingered the plastic identification bracelet sealed on her wrist . Women in street clothes or the hospital clothes issued to them were sitting ' vacantly along the walls or staring at the television set placed up on a shelf where no one could reach it to change the station or alter the volume level . It was less crowded than when she had been in last , markedly so . Just opposite her , two old women were chatting animatedly in strong Brooklyn Jewish accents , like two gossips on a park bench instead of two madwomen on a plastic bench in a mental hospital . But they might only be elderly and not mad . At their feet a young girl lay motionless with her hands over her face , like a pet dog snoozing . There were many less old women this time . Was there a new wastebasket for the old ? Four Puerto Rican men . were playing dominoes with bits of paper at a card table in a slow motion brought on by all of them being heavily drugged , like everybody else . The game seemed to occur under water . A child , a boy of eight or nine , sat near them picking his nose in the same kind of slow motion with such a look of blank despair on his small face she had to turn away . Most of the women were sitting on the plastic chairs that came in ranks of four against the wall , but there were more women than chairs . Though some were old , some children , some black , some brown , some white , they all looked more or less alike and seemed to wear a common expression . She knew that in a short while this ward , like every other she had been on , would be peopled by strong personalities , a web of romances and feuds and strategies for survival . She felt weary in advance . Who needed to be set down in this desolate limbo to survive somehow in the teeth of the odds ? She had had enough troubles already , enough ! 22 "
7285	7623	7624	7624	Dolly	305	" The dining room was around a bend in the corridor in the same ward . Back and forth they went , back and forth in the confined space from doorless bathroom to dining room to seclusion ( called treatment rooms here ) to the dormitories to the day room . · Lunch was a gray stew and an institutional salad of celery and raisins in orange jello . The food had no flavor except the sweet of the jello and she had to eat it all with a plastic spoon . At least the food did not need chewing in her bloody mouth . The objects in the stew were mushy , bits of soft flotsam and jetsam in lukewarm glue . She tried to think about how to get out of here , but her mind was mud . Lunch was over in fifteen minutes and then they were back in the day room , milling around to line up for medication . She needed her wits to plot how she would get out of here . The effects of the shot had not worn off . Then she held her face rigid when she saw the paper cup with the pills . Gracias , gracias . A pill was easily dealt with , unlike the liquid you had to swallow at once . She slipped it under her tongue , swallowed the water , and sat down on an orange chair . It did not do to head too quickly for the bathroom to spit out the pill . She kept it under her tongue till the coating wore off and she began to taste the bitter drug . Visiting hour came in midafternoon . Hope stabbed her when the attendant came to say she had a visitor . Dolly ! Dolly was heavily made up . She was not wearing her fur - collared coat but her old red belted coat Connie remembered from the year when Dolly was married and carrying Nita . “
7632	7633	7624	7624	Dolly	305	" “
7654	7655	7643	7645	a little patient	855	” “
7673	7681	7643	7645	a little patient	855	” Dolly chose to reply in English . “
7698	7719	7691	7691	Connie	554	" Politely reminding her that to be locked up in a mental institution was something she should be accustomed to . "

8221	8458	8210	8210	I	0	” She went into the bathroom after Dolly left and stayed there as long as she dared . Stalls without doors . In spite of the stink , it was a place to be almost alone , precious in the hospital . How could she scream at Dolly ? What use ? Dolly chose to believe Geraldo , and if she tried to 24 shake that belief , Dolly would only turn from her . Then Dolly would not help ber to get out , would not bring her clothing and the small necessities that could make the passing hollow days a little more bearable . She judged her niece for choosing Geraldo over her unborn baby and over herself ; but had n't she chosen to mourn for Claud almost to death ? Outside , did rain slick First Avenue ? Was the sun bleeding through a murky overcast ? Was it a rare blue day when the buildings stood crisp against the sky ? Here it was time for meds . Here it was time to line up for a paper cup of mouthwash . Here it was time to line up for . all starch meals . Here it was time to line up for more meds . Here it was time to sit and sit and sit . Here it was time to greet a familiar black face from the last time . "

8512	8554	8509	8510	my caseworker	869	” Here it was time to sit facing a social worker , Miss Ferguson , who looked at the records spread out on her desk rather than at her . Miss Ferguson sat tightly and occasionally she glanced toward the door . “
8565	8569	8555	8555	You	0	" Connie said . "
8618	8619	8612	8612	he	871	" “
8672	8685	8700	8701	Miss Ferguson	333	“ It is n't the same this time ! It is n't ! ”
8686	8699	8700	8701	Miss Ferguson	333	“ How can we help you if you wo n't let us ? ”
8717	8762	8704	8704	her	333	" Three years ago you were admitted to Bellevue on the joint recommendation of a social worker from the Bureau of Child Welfare , your caseworker from welfare , and your parole officer . You were then hospitalized at Rockover State for eight months . "
8763	8788	8700	8701	Miss Ferguson	333	“ They said I was sick and I agreed . Someone close to me had died , and I did n't want to live . "
8789	8797	8700	8701	Miss Ferguson	333	“ You have a history of child abuse "
8798	8805	8704	8704	her	333	“ Once ! I was sick ! "
8806	8823	8700	8701	Miss Ferguson	333	" Your parental rights were terminated . Your daughter Angelina Ramos was put out for adoption . "
8824	8853	8700	8701	Miss Ferguson	333	" I should never have agreed to that ! I did n't understand what was happening ! I thought they were just going to take care of her . ”
8854	8875	8881	8881	she	874	" It was the clinical judgment of the court psychiatrist that your daughter would be better off with foster parents . "
8898	8907	8884	8885	Miss Ferguson	333	" They were wrong to take my daughter ! ”
8914	8948	8910	8911	Miss Ferguson	333	" Imagine your daughter . I hurt her once . That was a terrible thing to do , I know it . But to punish me for it the rest of my life ! ”
9099	9119	9093	9093	\they	334	" The acquaintance who died — that would be your ... The black handicapped pickpocket whose assistant you were . "
9161	9164	9165	9165	He	884	“ Handicapped . "
9332	9352	9319	9319	he	336	" The Porto Rican man you describe as your niece 's Spimp'-is that the same man as her fiancé ? "
9353	9373	9374	9374	Connie	554	" He is her pimp . That 's how he makes a living . He has three other girls . ”
9391	9465	9466	9466	She	554	“ Look , please , Miss Ferguson , look at my mouth , where he hit me . Would you look at me , please , just for one moment ? My side . Here . It hurts awful . After they knocked me down , he kicked me while I was lying on the floor . When I breathe , each time , all the time , it hurts . I think — "
9489	9506	9466	9466	She	554	“ I think something 's wrong inside me . Where he kicked me on the floor . "
9507	9528	9466	9466	She	554	“ Who are the ' they ' you believe knocked you down ? Is that your niece , Dolores Campos ? ”
9529	9537	9540	9540	she	554	“ No ! He came in with a- ”
9546	9549	9540	9540	she	554	" doctor . ”
9559	9579	9540	9540	she	554	“ _ with a couple of pals — hoodlums . When I hit him , they knocked me down . ”
9580	9592	9466	9466	She	554	" You do admit , you remember that you struck him . "
9593	9601	9540	9540	she	554	“ Yes ! He was beating Dolly . "
9602	9610	9540	9540	she	554	" Your niece says you attacked her . ”
9611	9644	9645	9645	Her	897	" She told me he made her say that . Ask her in a room alone . I beg you , ask her alone . She 's scared to go against Geraldo . "
9661	9690	9656	9656	her	897	“ Please , Miss Ferguson , have a doctor look at me . I hurt so much . Please , I beg you . Look at my mouth . ”
9691	9706	9540	9540	she	554	" You say it hurts you . Where do you believe you feel pain ? "
9707	9737	9656	9656	her	897	“ In my side . My ribs . Also my mouth . And my back is burned . Those are the worse places . The rest is just bruises . "
9738	9743	9656	9656	her	897	“ In your side ? "
9744	9754	9540	9540	she	554	" It hurts every breath I take . Please ? "
9755	9773	9774	9775	Miss Ferguson	333	" Well , you do have bruises . All right , I 'll speak to the nurse . "
10322	10328	10319	10319	she	305	" What sign are you ? ”
10337	10340	10329	10330	The woman	4674	“ Sagittarius . ”
10349	10354	10329	10330	The woman	4674	" I 'm Aries . "
10355	10363	10364	10365	The attendant	4734	" Your sign is cuckoo , girl . ”
10916	10927	10886	10887	the nurse	4699	“ All right , Mrs. Ramos , get yourself together . "
10928	10945	10886	10887	the nurse	4699	“ I 'm getting out ! I knew it . I 'm getting out , right ? ”
10946	10966	10886	10887	the nurse	4699	" You 're going to the country . Trees and green grass , for a rest like you need . "
10967	10974	10975	10975	She	4734	" Do n't hand me that ! ”
10979	10994	10975	10975	She	4734	“ You ca n't send me up . I 'm only in for observation . "
10995	11009	10886	10887	the nurse	4699	" Your family wants you to get well , just as the doctor does "
11010	11021	10886	10887	the nurse	4699	" The doctor only spoke to me for five minutes ! ”
11022	11037	11038	11039	the nurse	4699	" You 're a sick woman . Everybody wants you to get well again , ”
11046	11055	11038	11039	the nurse	4699	" Do n't you want to get well ? ”
11056	11069	11120	11121	The nurse	4699	" Who 's signing me in ? Did my niece do this ? ”
11070	11096	11120	11121	The nurse	4699	“ Your brother Lewis . So you wo n't hurt yourself or Sanyone else . You 've been a bad girl again , Mrs. Ramos . ”
11097	11104	11038	11039	the nurse	4699	“ Where are you sending me ? ”
11106	11119	11120	11121	The nurse	4699	" You just get your things together . You 'll find out . ”
11902	11912	11934	11936	a young man	985	“ No ! No , mamacita , no hágalo ! ”
12642	12650	12651	12651	she	346	“ Ah , I do n't know , "
12657	12674	12651	12651	she	346	“ When you been out of a job so long , who 'll take you back ? "
12697	12730	12651	12651	she	346	" You 're too ... negative , Mrs. Ramos . Look at me . I went back to work after my children started school . I did n't work all those years . "
12731	12747	12762	12763	Mrs. Polcari	346	" How come you had children so young ? You got married in high school ? ”
12768	12803	12762	12763	Mrs. Polcari	346	“ Do n't butter me up , Mrs. Ramos . I did n't get married until I was twenty - six . My mother was sure I was going to die an old maid . ”
12804	12816	12762	12763	Mrs. Polcari	346	“ How old are your kids , then , Mrs. Polcari ? ”
12818	12832	12762	12763	Mrs. Polcari	346	“ The older boy is ten now , the younger just turned eight . ”
12963	12970	12971	12971	she	346	" We wear out so early , ”
12982	12984	12971	12971	she	346	“ we ”
12993	13010	13011	13011	them	1012	“ we 's . Once she had heard a social worker talking about Puerto Ricans , or "
13012	13035	13036	13036	they	1012	" as they were popularly called in that clinic ( as were her people in similar clinics in Texas ) , saying that "
13037	13329	13036	13036	they	1012	” got old fast and died young , so the student doing 35 her field work assignment should n't be surprised by some of the diseases they had , such as TB . It reminded her of Luis talking about the tropical fish he kept in his living room , marriage after marriage : Oh , they die easily , those neon tetras , you just buy more when your tank runs out . At least her dour pride kept her cleaning for Mrs. Polcari , who was not subject to the same physical laws , the same decay , the same grinding down under the scouring of time . Let Mrs. Polcari look down on her as a case with a bad history , a problem case ; but no dirt would Mrs. Polcari find on the chair she set her little behind on and no dirt would she find on the table from which she would sometimes agree to drink a cup of instant coffee with no sugar . After two days of scrubbing floors for the city ( welfare work program ) , she woke very early with morning pain low in her back but found herself smiling from sleep . La madrugada - daybreak — a word that always left honey in her mouth . That taste of sweet . The face of the young Indio smiling , beckoning , curiously gentle . He lacked the macho presence of men in her own family , nor did he have Claud 's massive strength , or Eddie 's edgy combativeness . His hands as they clasped hers , however , were not soft . Shaking hands ? Absurd . Warm , calloused , with a faint chemical odor . "
13336	13358	13359	13359	Connie	554	” the voice had asked . Highpitched , almost effeminate voice , but pleasant and without any trace of accent . - "
13361	13366	13359	13359	Connie	554	” she had said . "
13371	13372	13369	13369	Connie	554	" “
13378	13417	13376	13376	Luciente	309	” Strange that she had dreamed in English . Me llamo luciente : shining , brilliant , full of light . Strange that with someone obviously Mexican - American she had not said Consuelo . Me llamo Consuelo . "
13420	14284	13376	13376	Luciente	309	" he had urged , and she remembered then the touch of that warm , gentle , calloused hand on her bare arm . Trying to draw her along . Mostly she dreamed in English but even yet she had an occasional dream in Spanish . Years ago she had tried to figure out the kinds of dreams she had in each language , during her precious nearly two years at the community college when she had taken a psychology course . She should not have drawn back timidly from the young man 36 with his high , pleasant voice and his workman 's hands . She should have sidled up to him and rubbed her fat breasts against his chest . Even in sleep , she got nothing . She rubbed her arm idly where his warm hand had touched her . Coaxing . She had taken to dreaming about young boys . Maybe as she got older the boys of her dreaming soul would grow younger and more beardless , slender as matches . She rolled over , began to cough , to choke on phlegm . Cursing , she spat into a square of toilet paper and reached for the crumpled ' pack on the chair . Then she froze . Her fingers . That scent . She smelled her arm . Yes , her arm gave off that chemical on Luciente 's fingers . The hair rose on her nape . Idiot ! They 'd soon be locking her up again . So she 'd got her arm in something , probably cleaning that office , and dreamed about it , like making the ringing of an alarm into a bell tolling . The phlegm she coughed up was brown . A little blood from her throat ; that 's what she ought to be worrying about . She was too nervous to stop smoking , even though she knew it was hurting her . Oh , well , a taxi would run her down before she could die of cancer . A mugger would bash her head in . She would get cancer from eating garbage on the little money from welfare . Her neighbor Mrs. Silva knocked on her door shortly after she came back from shopping , from buying two rolls of toilet paper , bread , bananas , spaghetti , eggs . She wanted hamburger but she had n't the money for meat . Her niece Dolores , called Dolly , was on Mrs. Silva 's phone : Luis 's oldest , by his first marriage . Luis had got married a lot and by every wife he had kids . Her favorite was Dolly , who was twenty - two , plump and sweet as a candied yam . When Dolly had to get hold of her , she called Mrs. Silva . Dolly asked her to come down to Rivington Street and she grabbed her old green coat and her battered plastic purse and headed for the subway . On the express down to Brooklyn Bridge , she had a little piece of luck . As she was getting into the car she saw a ballpoint lying at the foot of a seat , and when she tried it , it worked . It had the name of a midtown stationer on it and wrote with blue ink . She had not had a pen that worked in months . She had to write her letters in pencil . Now she would write in ink , the way it should be . Tonight with her new 37 pen she would write to both her sisters . She tucked it carefully in her purse before she changed to the QJ train , checking that the tape was still making a repair so the pen would not slip out . She also picked up a Daily News that a man had left in his seat . At Essex and Delancey she headed north to Rivington , aware with a heavy lopsided sense of Norfolk a block over , where she had lived that year with Angelina in one room , that bad year after Claud had been sent to prison . That room like a box of pain . Dolly had found it for her after she had been kicked out of the apartment she had shared with Claud , three big rooms with their own bathroom just two blocks from Mount Morris Park . Dolly had lived then with her husband on Rivington , where she lived now with her daughter Nita , and the occasional presence of her rotten pimp , Geraldo . There was the bodega where Connie used to try to get credit till her check came , there was the liquor store she had known too well , with its racks and racks of cheap sweet wine . It was steamy hot in Dolly 's apartment , it always was . Nita was eating in a highchair getting to be too small for her , finishing coconut instant pudding and putting most of it into her mouth by now . . “
14291	14298	14299	14299	She	1014	” Connie hovered over her grandniece . “
14328	14351	14325	14326	Qué preciosa	1017	” Dolly 's face was swollen with tears and she rolled up the ruffled sleeve of her blouse to show a bruise . “
14359	14360	14361	14361	Geraldo	307	” “
14365	14366	14361	14361	Geraldo	307	" “
14382	14398	14399	14399	You	0	" Dolly sighed and rolled a joint in the licorice - flavored paper she liked . “
14416	14434	14409	14409	you	0	” Connie nodded , accepting the joint . As she let the smoke seep out she said , “
14447	14448	14440	14440	You	0	” “
14472	14473	14463	14463	I	0	” "

14635	14654	14622	14622	you	0	” Dolly sucked in the smoke , glowering . The minutes thickened between them . Finally she sniffled . “
14678	14679	14667	14668	one woman	1030	” “
14700	14701	14692	14692	He	1031	" "
14714	14720	14721	14721	He	1031	" She snapped her fingers . "
14784	14796	14770	14771	A1 man	1035	" So you did n't take your pills in Puerto Rico ? "
14797	14837	14888	14888	Connie	554	" I left them here . I did n't even put them in my purse . I thought too it might be lucky , a baby made on the island . I want to have this baby , Connie ! "
14838	14867	14890	14890	her	554	" Why not ? One child is lonely . Why not have another ? You 're a good mother . You quit this whoring and have the baby . "
14868	14883	14770	14771	A1 man	1035	" He wo n't let mel He says I got to have an abortion ! "
14884	14887	14888	14888	Connie	554	" No . "
14905	14951	14902	14902	Dolly	305	“ You have it ! Tell him to o.d . and sell his body to the city for rat bait . You come live with me . I 'll help you with the children . I 'd love that , you know it 's the truth "
15363	15379	15398	15398	he	1060	“ What 's wrong ? You 're weeping . Connie , did I frighten you ? ”
15415	15430	15398	15398	he	1060	“ I 'm going crazy ! But it could be the dope . Really powerful- "
15431	15451	15452	15452	Luciente	309	" I 'm here . I 've been trying to reach you . But you get frightened , Connie . ”
15463	15471	15461	15461	Mariquita	355	" What do you want from me ? ”
15497	15511	15490	15491	this boy	1061	" Just to talk . For you to relax and talk with me . ”
15512	15535	15536	15536	Connie	554	" Ha ! Nobody ever wants to talk to me . Not even my caseworker , Mrs. Polcari . I depress her . ”
15917	15926	15911	15911	She	554	" How long you planning to follow me ? "
15927	15943	15911	15911	She	554	“ I 'd rather talk to you at home , if you 'll let me . ”
15958	15969	15953	15953	He	1061	" No . Why should I ? Who are you ? "
15970	15980	15913	15913	her	554	“ You know my name , Connie . Luciente . "
15981	15992	15997	15997	he	1061	" Bright boy . What do you want with me ? "
16014	16037	15997	15997	he	1061	“ You 're an unusual person . Your mind is unusual . You 're what we call a catcher , a receptive . "
16039	16045	15997	15997	he	1061	" You like old women ? ”
16070	16074	16059	16059	She	1067	” Luciente laughed . "
16113	16199	16110	16111	a sender	1071	” He kept staring past her at cars , at the buildings right and left , up and down like a jíboro just off the plane ; like her own grandmother , who would pass into the street in downtown El Paso by crossing herself , refusing to look at the cars , and stepping straight off the curb as if plunging into deep water . He 's crazy , she thought . That 's it . She quickened her steps toward the subway station . "
16256	16274	16280	16280	you	1072	" A jet passed over and he stopped to gape till a building blocked it from sight . "
16320	16322	16323	16323	I	0	" . "

16487	16498	16458	16458	Your	1072	” Luciente reached for her arm , but she dodged . “
16526	16545	16523	16523	me	0	” The two cabs met at an intersection and both slammed their brakes . Luciente started muttering . . “
16556	16561	16549	16549	you	1072	” 42 Luciente grimaced . “
16572	16619	16568	16568	Buzzard	357	” Every time they came to a street , Luciente acted barely in control . He must have escaped from Bellevue . Her luck . He kept looking up and sideways and then trying not to . They were almost to Sixth Avenue when he said , “
16661	16662	16659	16659	you	1082	” "
16674	16688	16671	16672	a loon	1083	" Luciente beamed , capturing her hand in his dry , warm grip . "
16775	16994	16769	16769	I	0	" And with that Luciente abruptly was not there . Not till she was standing in the subway , wedged in , did she cautiously raise to her nose the hand he had seized . Yes , that chemical scent . She was afraid . She stood swaying between people to her right , her left , her back , clutching her purse and Daily News against her breasts with one hand while the other just reached the strap above . He was right about the whatever he called it - receptive part . Queasy things happened in her . She never talked about those happenings much - a little to Dolly , who consulted palm readers and bought herbs from the botánica in spite of speaking Spanish almost as badly as her father , Loois , who prided himself on having forgotten . Sometimes Connie knew at once things about others _ she should not know . She had known Luis was going to leave one of his wives before he knew he had decided . Her husband Eddie had called her a witch more than once -- for instance , when he had been with another woman and came home with that presence and his pride and guilt flickering sulfurlike around him in small yellow flames .

18324	18340	18446	18446	Mariana	359	“ The books made you sick ! College ? Not even Luis can go there . "
18341	18423	18173	18173	herself	359	" I can ! I 'm going to get a scholarship . I 'm not going to lie down and be buried in the rut of family , family , family ! I 'm so sick of that word , Mamá ! Nothing in life but having babies and cooking and keeping the house . Mamacita , believe me - oígame , Mamá - I love you ! But I 'm going to travel . I 'm going to be someone ! "
18424	18445	18446	18446	Mariana	359	“ There 's nothing for a woman to see but troubles . I wish I had never left Los Calcinados . "
18465	18502	18461	18461	she	359	“ I 've seen hundreds and hundreds of miles of a strange country full of strange and violent people . I wish I had never seen the road out of the village where I was born . "

I hope not , not only the expense but it costs so much and the pain it gives him . For kids to go in the hospital . I have been going to Mass whenever I can except lots of times I ca n't get away from the house because of children . I do n't want to have to take Joey to the hospital and leave him there . "
19176	19950	19951	19951	I	0	" Connie put down the letter on her kitchen table . Now , what did Teresa think she could do ? She could n't come up with money for any kind of present . She had n't had money for a birthday or Christmas present since she and Claud had been busted , almost four years . Teresa had married young , from high school , and never had she worked . Her man drove a bus . Connie wanted to remember her nieces and nephews , and when she had been working she used to send every one of them presents twice a year , to bring toys and pretty clothes to Luis 's various families , all conveniently located in the Greater New York metropolitan area . Number one wife ( Carmel , the Puerto Rican ) was in the Bronx . Number two ( Shirley , the Italian ) was on Staten Island . Number three ( Adele , the Wasp ) was with Luis in Bound Brook , New Jersey . She scanned the rest of the letter for catastrophes and decided to read it carefully later on . She had an urge to go back out , tired as she was . If she lay down she would get more depressed . She turned on the kitchen light . Evening thickened in the noisy streets . In the refrigerator she found pinto beans in chili sauce , good still . With reheated beans she would fry a couple of eggs . She was tired of eggs and yearned for meat . How she would like to sink her teeth in a pork chop . Her mouth watered in faint hope . She turned on the little black - and - white TV she was always hauling back and forth from bedroom to kitchen . The news came on . She listened with half an ear ; she did not have it turned loud . The set was company , a human - or almost humanvoice . She tended to leave it on even when she was cooking or reading . It was her family , she had once wryly told Mrs. Polcari , who had not understood . She stood slowly stirring the beans and waiting for the oil in the black frypan to heat up so she could break the eggs . She was in no hurry . What would she hurry toward ? 48 Below in the street evening hummed to the rhythm of high and low drums , a rising tide of dealing and hustling , the push of the young and not so young to score , to get laid . At a simmer , the slow bubbles rising through the thick air , sex and traffic quickened El Barrio . In thousands of meetings — accidental , accidental on purpose , clandestine , dating and courting - men were picking up women on corners , on stoops , in the family apartments , couples were going down the rotten stairs shoulder to shoulder , to restaurants and movies and bars and dancing . Women with no money were working magic in front of dim mirrors , frowning with concentration , as they waited for men to arrive . Couples climbed into cars and shot off into the night . Couples picked up barbecued ribs and chicharrones , couples carried packages of Chinese - Cuban takeout and beer upstairs to their rooms . Men met their pushers and their dealers , or missed them and turned to ash . On the roofs pigeons were released to fly , to circle together fluttering like clean handkerchiefs among the chimneys where kids turned on and shot up and packages and money were exchanged . That electricity in the streets brushed static from her . She longed to be moving toward someone . She wanted to have someone to go to , someone to meet , someone to come to her ; she wanted to be touched and held . So long ! Maybe never again . What did she live for ? The beans were sticking to the bottom of the pot , so she turned the flame low and stirred . Protecting Dolly ? Could she protect Dolly , really ? A fantasy of someday recovering her daughter ? Who would not know her . This is the woman the court saw fit to take you from , your evil and criminal and crazy mother . How Angelina had cried . So small , so thin , and so many tears . So many tears . "
19969	20015	19160	19160	she	368	” she said out loud . She turned up Walter Cronkite and seated herself to eat supper with him . Not that he would willingly eat with her , but boxed in her set with his public face hanging out , he had no choice . “
20024	20195	20022	20022	Walter	371	” She held out a fork with bent tines . Ojalá ! If only she had a glass of red wine . Even beer would taste good and blur the knife edges , but she had only supermarket - brand cola , and not much of that . At one time she had bought The New York Times every 40 night , when she had been working as secretary — let us say , secretary - mistress — to Professor Silvester of CUNY , another short time , like her almost two years in the community college , when she had been happy . She had got the job shortly after she had arrived in New York from Chicago . She had adored being secretary — should we say , secretary - mistress - errand girl - laundress - maid - research assistant — to Professor Everett Silvester . It was civilized . It was , if she shut her eyes just right , almost where she wanted to be . “
20208	21133	20204	20206	Professor Everett Silvester	347	” she said to Eric Severeid , and shut the sound off . Eric made fish faces in the TV and she grinned , wiping up her eggs and the remains of the beans with a slice of bread . Eric had been calling down labor unions , about how they were greedy . Everett Silvester had been fond of calling down the world , one item at a time . A fight was creeping through her wall from the next apartment , a fight in Spanish about money . Even though an oil company ad featuring an oceanful of singing fish was on now , she turned the sound back up . Finally she spread out her Daily News and skimmed it . GIRL SHOOTS M.D. IN L.A. LOVE SPAT She smiled , tucking her small chin into her palm . She saw herself marching into Everett 's Riverside Drive apartment and pulling out of a ratty shopping bag a Saturday Night Special . Mamá , how scared he would be ; he would shit in his pants with terror . Would the newspapermen ask her to sit on a table showing her legs ? It would be sordid but not unsatisfying , to pump at leisure and with careful and by no means wasteful aim several bullets into Professor Everett Silvester of the Romance Languages Department of CUNY , who liked to have a Spanish - speaking secretary , that is , a new one every year - dismissed when he went away for summer vacation . He called them all Chiquita , like bananas . So many years had run over her since then , he might not recognize her , he might .confuse her with some other year 's hot Latin secretary . The anger of the weak never goes away , Professor , it just gets a little moldy . It molds like a beautiful blue cheese in the dark , growing stronger and more interesting . The poor 50 and the weak die with all their anger intact and probably those angers go on growing in the dark of the grave like the hair and the nails . Ah , she should be thinking about Dolly . Dolly must leave Geraldo ; and do what for money ? To try to get money out of Luis was squeezing orange juice from a paper clip . ... Dolly and she would live together . This place was small here for all of them , but it would get Dolly away from Geraldo and then they could look for another apartment together . Money . How to get money ? She would wake again in a house with children . She would help Dolly through the pregnancy and cook and clean and rub her back . But would Dolly trust her ? Leaving a child - abuser with your little ones — for shame ! That 's how Luis would make her feel . Carmel would flop back and forth , a little jealous , a little relieved . Carmel worked in a beauty parlor and always her hair was some new neon color and crimped into curls resembling the colored excelsior that used to come in Easter baskets , but she stood on her feet in a blast of hot air for ten hours a day , evenings too , just getting by . Little enough she got from Luis , because she had truly loved him but had not been able to get him to marry her legally . She had been his common - law wife , a consensual marriage the whole family had viewed as a perfectly good marriage until the lawyers of Shirley 's family had proved that it never existed . Her father , Jesús , had brought them Easter baskets one year when Connie was , ten , little baskets from the dime store full of shredded cellophane and jelly beans and a chocolate bunny wrapped in foil . Tonight she could use something sweet , a chocolate bunny , even a purple jelly bean . She lit her after supper cigarette and flicked the channels all around . Nothing . Coughing from deep in her chest , she flipped the pages of the rumpled paper , looking for something to touch her mind . She felt so lonely , so aware of being alone this Friday night with spring percolating through the tenements that when she had smoked the cigarette down to the filter she laid her face on her crooked elbow and shut her eyes . Smell of newsprint . He had asked her to think of him . Who knew what he wanted ? To kill her and then it would be over and done . She shut her eyes and tried to think of nothing as debris of the day flickered past . Dolly 's face frowning with worry . Then she saw that Indio face . 51 , She did not care . Passive . Receptive . Here she was , abandoning herself to the stronger will of one more male . Letting herself be used , this time not even for something simple like sex or food or comfort but for something murky . It could only be bad . Yet she found herself concentrating on that face , waiting . Maybe a life could become threadbare enough so that even disaster beckoned , just so it wore a different face than the usual grimace of trouble . “
21153	21190	21143	21143	you	309	” She was going crazy a new way . After all , she no longer had a baby daughter to punish for being hers . Still , she jerked as a tentative hand tapped her shoulder . "

21705	21715	21678	21680	a college graduate	1192	" They stared at each other in mutual confusion . “
21727	21731	21678	21680	a college graduate	1192	" Connie snapped . “
21756	21761	21752	21754	lords and counts	1194	” Luciente looked miserable . “
21775	21789	21771	21773	Rose of Ithaca	376	" He paused for her appreciation , then shrugged , a little crestfallen . "
21799	21800	21771	21773	Rose of Ithaca	376	" "
21827	21840	21841	21841	I	0	” Connie lit a cigarette . Luciente leaped up and backed away . “
21865	21922	21861	21861	you	0	" Dumbfounded , she stared at him . He seemed terrified , as if she held a bomb , and indeed his hand was fumbling behind him at the locks on the door . Bemused , she stubbed the cigarette out , and after the smoke had cleared , cautiously he approached the table fanning wildly . “
22025	22034	22017	22017	I	0	” Luciente clapped his hands to his cheeks . “

22278	22302	22238	22238	you	1202	” Then she hauled him up by the arm and marched him into the hall . He hung back skittishly until she said , “
22308	22373	22305	22306	no one	4656	” Then he scuttled behind her nervously as she opened the door and showed him the toilet . She wished it were cleaner . She felt a little embarrassed . The other people who used it never cleaned it , and she cursed as she cleaned for all of them once a week . She flushed the toilet , pulling the chain for demonstration . “
22384	22456	22305	22306	no one	4656	" Following him back to her apartment and routinely locking the door with the bolt , the Yale lock , the police lock with its metal rod that fit into the floor , she sucked her lip with satisfaction . For the first time she had scored a point . Then she realized her reaction made sense only if she was such a naïve idiot as to believe his fairy tale . "
22464	22478	22479	22479	I	0	” Luciente rubbed his scalp , setting his long thick black hair flying . “

26081	26094	26070	26070	she	382	" Connie , at last ! Fasure it 's been three weeks ! "
26095	26111	26146	26146	She	382	“ This is the first time I 've been by myself since the first night . "
26112	26121	26122	26122	She	382	“ Are we responsible for your being here ? ”
26130	26133	26122	26122	She	382	" No . "
26134	26145	26146	26146	She	382	“ Fasure ? You 're not just painting the bones ? "
26169	26179	26180	26180	Luciente	309	" It 's running hard for me to comprend , ”
26188	26211	26180	26180	Luciente	309	“ Might as well be Yif . Your mem has a sweet friend who abuses per and who ... sold your sister ? ”
26212	26243	26244	26244	Luciente	309	“ Her pimp , Geraldo . And she 's my niece , not my sister . Geraldo is a pig ! He did n't want her to have his baby . ”
26267	26303	26256	26256	he	1344	" Uh , I know you people ate a great deal of meat . But was it common to feed upon person ? Or is this slavery , I thought wiped out by your time ? ”
26314	26336	26256	26256	he	1344	“ Sometimes we have nothing to feed on but our pain and each other . ... What 's that about meat ? ”
26337	26351	26375	26375	Luciente	309	" How did this Geraldo sell per flesh then , and pigs too ? ”
26352	26356	26361	26361	she	1345	" She hustles ! "
26367	26374	26361	26361	she	1345	“ Puta . Tart . Whore . ”
26402	26411	26384	26384	she	1345	“ Who do you talk to with that ? ”
26413	26440	26441	26441	Luciente	309	" My kenner ? It ties into an encyclopedia — a knowledge computer . Also into transport and storage . Can serve as locator - speaker . ”
26450	26482	26447	26447	he	1344	“ Oh . Had to do with sex . Prostitution ? I 've read of this and seen a drama too about person who sold per body to feed per family ! ”
26483	26502	26384	26384	she	1345	“ I suppose nobody in your place sells it , huh ? Like they say about Red China . ”
26503	26512	26441	26441	Luciente	309	" We do n't buy or sell anything . "
26513	26524	26447	26447	he	1344	“ But people do go to bed , I guess ? "
26543	26572	26536	26536	she	554	“ I suppose since you 're alive and got born , they must still do that little thing , when they are n't too busy with their computers ? "
26574	26581	26582	26582	Luciente	309	" Two statements do n't follow . ”
26589	26628	26582	26582	Luciente	309	" Fasure , we couple . Not for money , not for a living . For love , for pleasure , for relief , out of habit , out of curiosity and lust . Like you , no ? ”
26649	26655	26644	26644	herself	554	“ Do you like women ? ”
26656	26660	26661	26661	Luciente	309	" All women ? ”
26672	26747	26661	26661	Luciente	309	“ Oh , for coupling ? In truth , the most intense mating of my life was a woman named Diana — the fire that annealed me , as Jackrabbit says in a poem . But it was a binding , you know , we obsessed . Not good for growing . We clipped each other . But I love Diana still and sometimes we come together . ... Mostly I 've liked males . "
26748	26753	26661	26661	Luciente	309	“ I thought so . ”
26814	26838	26839	26839	Luciente	309	“ You 're lonely here , and I just let you down . Truly , I 'm not rigid and I like you . ”
26852	26882	26839	26839	Luciente	309	“ What is this place ? You seem to be locked in . I 've seen holies about your prisons and concentration camps . Is this such a place ? "
26883	26943	26839	26839	Luciente	309	“ No . I 'd rather be in prison . Unless you 're on an indeterminate , at least you know when you 're getting out . They can keep me here till I go out with my feet in the 64 air . It 's a loony bin - a mental hospital . * Luciente consulted his wrist . “

27849	27867	27868	27868	You	1357	" Luciente gently drew her against him and held her in his arms so their foreheads touched . “
27903	27928	27929	27929	You	1357	” Pressed reluctantly , nervously against Luciente , she felt the coarse fabric of his shirt and ... breasts ! She jumped back . 66 "
27944	27945	27931	27932	a woman	1121	" "
27967	28016	27963	27963	I	0	” Luciente looked a little disgusted . She stared at Luciente . Now she could begin to see him / her as a woman . Smooth hairless cheeks , shoulderlength thick black hair , and the same gentle Indian face . With a touch of sarcasm she said , “
28025	28100	27963	27963	I	0	” In anger she turned on her heel and stalked a few paces away . A dyke , of course . That bar in Chicago where the Chicana dykes hung out shooting pool and cursing like men , passing comments on the women who walked by . Yet they had never given her that sense of menace a group of men would - after all , under the clothes they were only women too . “
28107	28129	28101	28101	I	0	” Luciente 's face was screwed up with confusion . She still held out her hands to draw Connie to her . "
28175	28282	28167	28167	You	0	” Feeling like a fool , Connie did not choose to reply . Instead she paced to the locked door with its peephole and then to the radiator . Luciente spoke , she moved with that air of brisk unselfconscious authority Connie associated with men . Luciente sat down , taking up more space than women ever did . She squatted , she sprawled , she strolled , never thinking about how her body was displayed . It was hard to pace with dignity in the tiny space between the stained mattress and the wall . Connie no longer felt in the least afraid of Lucjente . "
28287	28300	28285	28285	Connie	554	” Luciente came over and cautiously put an arm around her shoulders . “
28341	28342	28339	28339	you	0	" "
28347	28568	28339	28339	you	0	” She stood awkwardly and let Luciente pull her close and lean their foreheads together . Hardly ever did she embrace another woman along the full length of their bodies , and it was hard to ease her mind . She could feel Luciente concentrating , she could feel that cone of energy bearing down on her . It reminded her of the old intensity of a man wanting ... something — her body , her time , her comfort -- that bearing down that wanted to : grab her and push her under . But she was weary and beaten and she let herself yield . What had she to lose ? Although she could sense in Luciente a bridled impatience , the woman held her gently . A harnessed energy to be doing drove this plant geneticist with breasts like a fertility goddess under the coarse fabric of a red work shirt . A woman who liked her : she felt that too . A rough ignorant goodwill caressed her . Then she smelled salt in the air , a marsh tang . A breeze ruffled the loose rag of dress , chilling her calves . Under her feet she felt stone . A gull mewed , joined by another somewhere above her . Luciente relaxed her grip . “
28586	28670	28673	28673	we	1390	” Rocket ships , skyscrapers into the stratosphere , an underground mole world miles deep , glass domes over everything ? She was reluctant to see this world . Voices far , near , laughter , birds , a lot of birds , somewhere a dog barked . Was that - yes , a rooster crowing at midday . That pried her eyes open . A rooster ? Fearfully she stared into Luciente 's face , broken open in a grin of triumph . “
28675	28676	28673	28673	we	1390	” "
28689	28703	28686	28686	I	0	” Luciente took her by the arm and swung around to her side . “
28715	28827	28828	28828	You	1393	” She looked slowly around . She saw ... a river , little po account buildings , strange structures like long - legged birds with sails that turned in the wind , a few large terraicotta and yellow buildings and one blue dome , irregular buildings , none bigger than a supermarket of her day , an ordinary supermarket in any shopping plaza . The bird objects were the tallest things around and they were scarcely higher than some of the pine trees she could see . A few lumpy free - form structures overrun with green vines . No skyscrapers , no spaceports , no traffic jam in the sky . "
28841	28842	28828	28828	You	1393	” “

28912	28920	28904	28904	You	1393	" It 's not like I imagined . ”
29045	29051	29052	29052	he	1405	“ Got through , uh ? ”
29060	29070	29052	29052	he	1405	" Can you see the person from the past ? "
29071	29081	29324	29324	Luciente	309	" Sure . Had my vision readjusted last month . "
29082	29085	29086	29086	Luciente	309	“ Zo ! ”
29093	29113	29086	29086	Luciente	309	“ Good we were cautious in your time . I may be visible there too that could bring danger ! ”
29114	29127	29324	29324	Luciente	309	“ Why is n't it dangerous for me to be seen here ? "
29128	29136	29324	29324	Luciente	309	" Everybody knows why you 're here . ”
29138	29143	29324	29324	Luciente	309	“ Everybody except me . "
29160	29171	29324	29324	Luciente	309	“ What 's on top ? Some kind of skylights ? "
29172	29278	29324	29324	Luciente	309	“ Rainwater - holding and solar energy . Our housing is above ground because of seepage - water table 's close to the surface . We 're almost wetland but not quite , so it 's all right to build here . I 'll show you other villages , different . ... I guess , compared to your time , there 's less to see and hear . That time I came down on the streets of Manhattan , I 'd thought I 'd go deafl ... In a way we could half envy you , such fat , wasteful , thing - filled times ! ”
29279	29288	29324	29324	Luciente	309	" They are n't so fat for me . "
29289	29298	29299	29299	Connie	554	" Are you what would be called poor ? ”
29306	29323	29299	29299	Connie	554	“ I 've been down and out for a while . A run of hard times . "
29401	29478	29399	29399	them	1410	“ Goats ! Jesús y María , this place is like my Tío Manuel 's in Texas . A bunch of wetback refugees ! Goats , 69 chickens running around , a lot of huts scavenged out of real houses and the white folks ' garbage . All that lacks is a couple of old cars up on blocks in the yard ! What happened — that big war with atomic bombs they were always predicting ? ”
29480	29499	29500	29500	Luciente	309	-"But we like it this way ! Oh , Connie , we thought you 'd like it too ! ”
29508	29557	29558	29558	Luciente	309	“ We 'd change it if we did n't like it , how not ? We 're always changing things around . As they say , what is n't Viving dies . . .. I 'm always quoting homilies . Jackrabbit says my words run out in poppers . ”
29564	29579	29558	29558	Luciente	309	“ The miniature packaged components of circuitry ? Jackrabbit means all in a box . ”
29587	29600	29580	29580	Luciente	309	-“So you have some machines ? It is n't religious or anything ? "
29601	29607	29608	29608	Luciente	309	" Fasure we have machines . ”
29622	29633	29634	29634	Her	309	“ When you see more , you 'll like better . ”
29667	29723	29661	29661	She	309	“ We raise chickens , ducks , pheasants , partridges , turkeys , guinea hens , geese . Goats , cows , rabbits , turtles , pigs . We of Mattapoisett are famous for our turtles and our geese . But our major pro teins are plant proteins . Every region tries to be ownfed . ”
29724	29728	29661	29661	She	309	" Own what ? "
29729	29740	29741	29741	Luciente	309	" Ownfed . Self - sufficient as possible in proteins . ”
29754	29784	29741	29741	Luciente	309	“ I bump around at this , but I just thought of something important . You 're right , Connie , we 're peasants . We 're all peasants . "
29785	29863	29661	29661	She	309	" Forward , into the past ? Okay , it 's better to live in a green meadow than on 111th Street . But all that striving and struggling to end up in the same old bind . Stuck back home on the farm . Peons again ! Back on the same old dungheap with ten chickens and a goat . That 's where my grandparents scratched out à dirt - poor life ! It depresses me . "
29864	29982	30087	30087	Luciente	309	" Connie , wait a little , trust a little . We have great belief in our ways . Let me show you .... No ! Let our doing show itself . Let people open and unfold . ... Think of it this way : there was much good in the life the ancestors led here on this continent before the white man came 70 conquering . There was much brought that was useful . It has taken a long time to put the old good with the new good into a greater good . ... You 're freezing . Let 's get you a jacket . Then you must come and meet my family at lunch . ”
29983	30016	29661	29661	She	309	“ I 'm not going to meet a bunch of strangers in this filthy bughouse dress . I 'm not ! Besides , I 'm not hungry . Thorazine kills my appetite . ”
30018	30086	30087	30087	Luciente	309	" We can work on that later . We may be able to teach you to control the effects of the drug . ... But about the clothing - come , we 'll get you some and a jacket . I 'm sensitive as rock salt , as Bee and Jackrabbit both tell me . So come to my house à minute and we 'll find something . "
30205	30272	30165	30165	she	1412	“ I bred that . Wait till you see it bloom ! Called Diana . Big sturdy white with dark red markings and an intense musk fragrance , subzero hardy . It 's popular up in Maine and New Hampshire cause it 's so hardy for a climber . I bred back into Rugosa using Molly Maguire stock . ... Oops ! I barge on . Comel "
30392	30399	30383	30383	Luciente	309	“ Three of you live here ? "
30401	30411	30383	30383	Luciente	309	“ Three ? No , this is my space . "
30412	30431	30383	30383	Luciente	309	“ I thought you lived with two men . The Bee and Jackrabbit you 're always talking about . "
30432	30487	30383	30383	Luciente	309	“ We 're sweet friends . Some of us use the term ' core ' for those we 're closest to . Others think that distinction is bad . We debate . Myself , I use core , cause I think it means something real . Bee , Jackrabbit , Otter , are my core ”
30488	30492	30383	30383	Luciente	309	“ Another lover ! ”
30493	30523	30383	30383	Luciente	309	" No , Otter 's a hand friend , not a pillow friend . We 've been close since we were sixteen . Politically we are very close . ... "
30524	30537	30538	30538	Luciente	309	“ But if you live alone , who do they live with ? ”
30543	30568	30538	30538	Luciente	309	" We each have our own space ! Only babies share space ! I have indeed read that people used to live piled together . ”
30572	30600	30538	30538	Luciente	309	" Connie , you have space of your own . How could , one live otherwise ? How meditate , think , compose songs , sleep , studymo "
30619	30620	30621	30621	We	1433	” “
30660	30674	30656	30656	I	0	" Luciente slid aside a door and took out pants and a shirt . “
30702	30827	30694	30694	I	0	” Alone , Connie got into the clothes quickly . Luciente was taller and a little broader in the shoulders , but Connie was broader in the hips and behind , so that at first she could not close the pants . Then she found an adjustment in the seams so that they could be tightened or loosened , lengthened or shortened . A woman would not outwear them if she gained or lost twenty pounds . Well , they 'd invented one new thing in this Podunk future . After she put on the shirt , she looked around the room . By the desk a screen was set into the wall . A television ? Curious , she pressed the On button . “
30850	31067	31068	31068	Mao	397	" a woman 's voice said . When Connie went on staring at it , it eventually repeated itself exactly , and she realized it was recorded . She pushed T for transmission , she hoped . The screen began flashing the names of articles or talks , obviously in plant genetics . As the screen flashed the meaningless 72 titles , she read the other buttons . One said PREC , so she tried it . A description like a little book review came on and remained there for two minutes . ATTEMPTS TO INCREASE NUTRITIONAL CONTENT IN WINTER GRAIN ( TRITICALE SIBERICA ) SUITABLE SHORT SEASON NORTHERN CROPS MAINTAINING INSECT & SMUT RESISTANCE . PROMISING DIRECTION . FULL BREEDING INFO . JAMES BAY CREE , BLACK DUCK GROUP , 10 PP . 5 DC . 2 PH . Feeling watched , she shut the set off guiltily and jumped back . Then she saw that a large , long - haired cat the color of a peach had got up from a window ledge - a shelf built on the inside for a row of plants and perhaps the cat itself to sun on . The cat strode toward her with a purposeful air , hopped on a chair , and faced her expectantly . "
31072	31346	31068	31068	Mao	397	” The cat blinked , averted its gaze , then glanced back . It repeated the gesture several times , each time more slowly , , with a pause in between when it kept its amber stare fixed on her face . She felt a little scared . Did it think she was some kind of big mouse ? Did it expect to be fed ? Finally with a snort the cat hopped off the chair and pointedly , she could not help feeling , turned its back and flounced off to the sunny window . But it kept its ears cocked toward her . As she opened the door , she found Luciente squatting outside in the rough grass like a peon , watching a small dark blue butterfly . She looked as if she could squat there all day . Well , what did I expect from the future , Connie asked herself . Pink skies ? Robots on the march ? Transistorized people ? I guess we blew ourselves up and now we 're back to the dark ages to start it all over again . She stood a moment , weakened by a sadness she could not name . A better world for the children — that had always been the fantasy ; that however bad things were , they might get better . But if Angelina had a child , and that child a child , this was the world they would finally be born into in five generations : how different was it really from rural Mexico with its dusty villages rubbing their behinds into the dust ? “
31353	31357	31358	31358	Ants	399	” Luciente said , “

31520	31546	31515	31516	No youth	1455	" All this time Luciente was hustling her along the stone path toward the translucent blue dome . Connie waited to get a word in . “

31669	31994	31657	31657	Dawn	400	" The room they entered took up half the dome and was filled with big tables seating perhaps fifteen at each , mostly dressed in the ordinary work clothes that Luciente wore , the children in small versions . The pants , the shirts , the occasional overalls or tunics came in almost every color she could name , many faded with washing and age , although the fabrics seemed to hold up . Everybody looked to be talking at once , yet it was n't noisy . The scene was livelier than institutional feeding usually made for . A child was climbing on a bench to tell a story , waving both arms . At the far end a man with a mustache was weeping openly into his soup and all about him people were patting his shoulders and making a big fuss . People were arguing heatedly , laughing and telling jokes , and a child was singing loudly at the table nearest the door . Really , this could be a dining room in a madhouse , the way people 74 sat naked with their emotions pouring out , but there was a strong energy level here . The pulse of the room was positive but a little overwhelming . She felt buffeted . Why was n't it noisier ? Something absorbed the sound , muted the voices shouting and babbling , the scrapes of melody and laughter , the calls , the clatter of dishes and cutlery , the scraping of chairs on the floor - made of ' plain oldfashioned wood , as far as she could tell . Unless it was all some clever imitation ? She could not believe how many things they seemed to make out of wood . Some panels in the wall - ceiling of the dome were transparent and some were translucent , although from the outside she had not seen any difference . "
32060	32085	32054	32054	we	1466	" Luciente was heading for a table on the far side , where everyone except the littlest child stopped eating to watch them approach . “
32130	32176	32196	32196	usor	1472	” On the translucent panels designs had been painted or baked in - she could not tell — in a wild variety of styles and levels of competence , ranging from sophisticated abstracts , landscapes , and portraits to what must be children 's drawings . “
32184	32189	32196	32196	usor	1472	” Luciente looked surprised . “
32260	32288	32290	32290	myself	0	” Like a child ! She could not imagine any woman of the age they must share saying in El Barrio or anyplace else she had lived , “
32296	32324	32292	32292	I	0	” Indeed , they were like children , all in unisex rompers , sitting at their long kindergarten tables eating big plates of food and making jokes . “
32348	32440	32341	32342	other people	1375	" They had reached the table through a sea of spicy 75 odors that touched her stomach to life . Two places were vacant , set with handsome heavy pottery dishes in earth colors , glass tumblers on the heavy side , and cutlery of a smooth substance that was neither silver nor stainless steel and perhaps not even metal . Someone - slender , young - leaped up and hugged Luciente , held out his?/ her ? arms to her , checked the gesture , and smiled a brilliant welcome . “
32452	32453	32341	32342	other people	1375	” "
32470	32692	32463	32463	I	0	” Luciente said , hugging the youth back . They were literally patted into their seats and she found herself cramped with nervousness . Touching and caressing , hugging and fingering , they handled each other constantly . In a way it reminded her again of her childhood , when every emotion seemed to find a physical outlet , when both love and punishment had been expressed directly on her skin . Large platters of food passed from hand to hand : a cornbread of coarse - grained meal with a custard layer and a crusty , wheaty top ; butter not in a bar but a mound , pale , sweet and creamy ; honey in an open pitcher , dark with a heady flavor . The soup was thick with marrow beans , carrots , pale greens she could not identify , rich in the mouth with a touch of curry . In the salad were greens only and scallions and herbs , yet it was piquant , of many leaves blended with an oil tasting of nuts and a vinegar with a taste of ... sage ? Good food , good in the mouth and stomach . Pleasant food . Luciente was saying everyone 's name , leaving her battered . Nobody seemed to have more than one . "

32725	32740	32720	32720	his	407	“ We give back with the name we happen to have at that time . "
32741	32798	32799	32799	She	1479	" Surnames . Look , my name is Consuelo Ramos . Connie for short . Consuelo is my Christian name , my first name . Ramos is my last name . When I was born I was called Consuelo Camacho . Ramos is the name of my second husband : therefore I am Consuelo Camacho Ramos . ”
32844	32850	32841	32841	Luciente	309	“ We have no equivalent . ”
32855	32887	32841	32841	Luciente	309	“ I suppose you have numbers . I guess you 're only called by first names because your real name — your identification — is the number you get at birth . "
32888	32902	32903	32907	The tall intense young person	1488	“ Why would we be numbered ? We can tell each other apart . "
32962	32972	32933	32933	he	377	“ But the government . How are you identified ? "
32973	32986	32915	32915	Luciente	309	" When I was born , I was named Peony by my mothers- "
32987	32996	32933	32933	he	377	“ Peony sounds like a girl 's name . "
32997	33092	33093	33093	He	1489	“ I do n't understand . It was the name chosen for me . When I came to naming , I took my own name . Never mind what that was . But when Luciente brought me down to earth after my highflying I became Jackrabbit . You see . For my long Tegs and my big hunger and my big penis and my jumps through the grass of our common life . When Luciente and Bee have quite reformed me , I will change my name again , to Cat in the Sun . ”
33112	33143	33103	33103	Luciente	309	“ But why have two names at one time ? In our village we have only one Jackrabbit . When I visit someplace else , I 'm Jackrabbit of Mattapoisett . "
33144	33155	33093	33093	He	1489	" You change your name any time you want to ? "
33156	33169	33170	33170	Barbarossa	407	“ If you do it too often , nobody remembers your name , "
33179	33190	33170	33170	Barbarossa	407	“ Sometimes youths do that the first years after naming . "
33211	33242	33207	33207	Sojourner	412	“ They 're always trying out fancy new labels every week till no one can call them anything but Hey you or Friend . It slows down by and by . ”
33243	33268	33170	33170	Barbarossa	407	" All right — you have those things on your wrist . Somewhere there 's a big computer . How does it recognize you ? ”
33269	33279	33280	33280	Luciente	309	“ My own memory annex is in my kenner , ”
33283	33297	33280	33280	Luciente	309	“ With transport of encyclopedia , you just call for what you want . ”
33299	33324	33170	33170	Barbarossa	407	“ But what about the police ? What about the government ? How do they keep track of you if you keep changing names ? ”
33349	33354	33342	33342	them	1492	“ This is complicated ! "
33363	33383	33360	33360	her	1494	“ Government I think I grasp . Luciente can show you government , but nobody 's working there today . "
33384	33404	33405	33405	Luciente	309	“ Maybe next time . I will try to study up on this , but it 's very difficult , ”
33408	33417	33418	33419	a child	4613	" We should all study to help Luci , ”
33422	33441	33418	33419	a child	4613	“ In the meantime , maybe you could ask something easier ? You said something about the paintings ? ”
33442	33485	33486	33489	A slight blond man	1496	" It does n't matter . I just thought it was funny you put up the kid 's stuff . I mean everybody wants to look at their own kid 's pictures , but nobody wants to look at anybody else 's . ”
33500	33507	33486	33489	A slight blond man	1496	“ But they 're all ours . "
33508	33517	33518	33518	Jackrabbit	377	“ We change the panels all the time , "
33521	33569	33518	33518	Jackrabbit	377	" For instance , say I make one and later it stales on me . I make a new one . Or if everybody tires of one , we discuss and change . I did that whole big river namelon on the east , cause people wanted . ”
33576	33583	33570	33570	Luciente	309	“ What 's wrong , Connie ? "
33584	33590	33591	33591	Jackrabbit	377	" Connie 's worn out , ”
33594	33616	33591	33591	Jackrabbit	377	“ Strangers , every lug asking questions , holding the contact . You imagine there 's no energy drain in catching . "
33624	33636	33617	33617	Luciente	309	“ You look gutted . Remember this food will not sustain . "
33637	33641	33642	33642	She	309	" Why not ? ”
33652	33658	33617	33617	Luciente	309	" I can taste it . "
33659	33677	33617	33617	Luciente	309	“ As in dreams . You experience through me . . . . We better go back . ”
33678	33684	33617	33617	Luciente	309	“ Finish your lunch first . ”
33697	33708	33617	33617	Luciente	309	" This exhaustion worries me . I must teach you exercises “
33720	33721	33617	33617	Luciente	309	” “
33751	33784	33748	33748	you	309	" She felt leaden , her feet wading through loose sand . 78 As they shuffled out , Luciente looked worried . Standing at last on the stone walk , Connie mumbled , “
33790	33791	33792	33792	Your	309	” "
33837	34105	34106	34106	I	0	" Luciente drew her into the firm embrace with their foreheads touching . She was too spent to do more than fall into Luciente 's concentration as into a fast stream , the waters churning her under . She came to propped against the wall of the seclusion room . The tears had dried on the sleeve of her faded dress . She lay down at once on the bare , piss - stained mattress and fell asleep . Four DPRING in the violent ward was only more winter , except for a little teasing of the eyeballs when she stood at the high , heavily barred window . The radiators still pumped blasts of heat into the air that the smell of disinfectant and stale bodies turned into a foul broth . Pain and terror colored the air of Ward L-6 . Pain silvered the air ; when she was lurching into drugged sleep , pain sloshed over from the other beds . Yet spring finally came to Ward L one April Wednesday . She was sitting near the station , hoping to do some little job to cadge cigarettes . As one of the functional patients , she got on with the attendants , except for an evil redheaded racist bitch on weekends , and with one of them , Ms. Fargo , she got on well . Ms. Fargo was close to her in color and size and age , but black and free - as free as any woman making that kind of wage with six kids at home could be called free . "
34112	34122	34106	34106	I	0	" Fargo told her with a big gaptoothed grin . “
34151	34759	34146	34146	Ms.	1503	" Fargo talked to her almost humanly . When Fargo was working , she often waited around near the glassed - in station and sometimes Fargo would ask her to sweep the floor or take a woman to the bathroom or hold a patient for an injection or sit with a patient coming out of electro- 80 shock . Then Fargo would give her extra cigarettes . She hated being around the shock shop . It scared her . Regularly some patients from L-6 were wheeled out for shock . One morning there would be no breakfast for you , and then you would know . They would wheel you up the hall and inject you to knock you out and shoot you up with stuff that turned your muscles to jelly , so that even your lungs stopped . You were a hair from death . You entered your death . Then they would send voltage smashing through your brain and knock your body into convulsions . After that they 'd give you oxygen and let you come back to life , somebody 's life , jumbled , weak , dribbling saliva - come back from your scorched taste of death with parts of your memory forever burned out . A little brain damage to jolt you into behaving right . Sometimes it worked . Sometimes a woman forgot what had scared her , what she had been worrying about . Sometimes a woman was finally more scared of being burned in the head again , and she went home to her family and did the dishes and cleaned the house . Then maybe in a while she would remember and rebel and then she 'd be back for more barbecue of the brain . In the back wards the shock zombies lay , their brains so scarred they remembered nothing , giggling like the old lobotomized patients . On that Wednesday she was sitting there hopefully , but Fargo was deep in gossip with another black attendant . Connie had gone up once for a light — the only way inmates could get a match was to beg for one — and had been told to wait a minute , honey , half an hour ago . Fourother patients were waiting too with small requests . She knew better than to approach again . On her lap was spread yesterday 's paper , a present from Fargo for cleaning up vomit , but she had read through it , including births and deaths and legal notices . Mrs. Martínez approached her , eyes meeting hers and then downcast in a gesture that reminded her suddenly of Luciente 's orange cat . Several weeks had passed since she had been in contact with the future , although almost daily she felt Luciente 's presence asking to be let through . Here in the violent ward she was afraid to allow contact , for she had to watch her step . She was never alone , not even in the toilets without doors , never away from surveillance . Mrs. Martínez stood almost in front of her but a little to one side and fixed her eyes longingly on the news- 81 paper , met her gaze questioningly , then glanced away . For months Mrs. Martínez had not spoken . The attendants treated her as a piece of furniture . Many of the withdrawn had their own ways of speaking without words to anyone who was open , and Connie never had much trouble figuring out what Mrs. Martinez wanted . She handed over the paper . “
34781	35013	35014	35014	Sybil	418	” A paper like that made a good pillow and she had no intention of abandoning it . Mrs. Martínez smiled , her eyes thanked Connie , and carefully , as if bearing off a baby , she took the paper away to the corner to pore over . Connie determined to keep an eye on Martínez and make sure nobody strong - armed the paper from her . Martínez would long ago have been transferred from this acute ward to a chronic ward and left to rot there , except that her husband was on a D.A. 's staff and came up to see her the last Sunday in every month with her children - never allowed inside , although she would stand at the window and weep and weep and hold out her hands to them . He would sign her out for holidays , but always , after a month or two , he would bring her back . Connie was watching Martínez turn the pages slowly , when two orderlies brought in a woman handcuffed to a stretcher , trundling her past roaring muffled protest . A sheet was tied over her and only her hair was visible , long auburn hair clotted now with fresh blood . Her voice rose out of the sheet , her voice soared like a furious eagle flapping auburn wings . . "
35016	35328	35014	35014	Sybil	418	” Connie cried out and half rose . Then she shut up . Give nothing away . She watched them wrestle Sybil into seclusion and heard the thump as they threw her against the wall . Her tall , bony body would be snapping its vertebrae , bucking with rage , until the dose took and she could no longer move . Sitting quietly , Connie clasped her hands in her lap . Sybil was here . A slow warmth trickled through her . She had been lonely here , for few of the women on L-6 had energy left to relate , in their anguish of dealing with mommy , daddy , death , and the raw stuff of fear . She hoped the orderlies had not beaten her friend badly and that Sybil would simmer down and get out of seclusion soon . She had to try to get a message to Sybil 82 through the locked door . Patients were not allowed to communicate with those in the isolation cells . Her last time here they had met , and in the strange twilit childhood of the asylum with its advancements and demotions , its privileges and punishments , its dreary air of grade school , they had twice been confined in the same ward long enough to become friends . Each patient rose and dropped through the dim rings of hell gaining and losing privileges , sent down to the violent wards , ordered to electroshock , filed away among the living cancers of the chronic wards , rewarded by convalescent status , allowed to do unpaid housework and go to dance therapy ; but twice they had come to rest on the same step and they had talked and talked and talked their hearts to each other . Patience was the only virtue that counted here . "
35334	35344	35014	35014	Sybil	418	” she imagined embroidering on a little sampler , like “
35350	35457	35345	35348	Dios Bendiga Nuestro Hogar	420	” A week wormed through her soul before they let Sybil on the ward , That morning she sat away from the station for privacy . When Sybil entered , looking tall and drawn , Connie did not greet her except with her eyes . It did not do to presume too much or to impose . Sometimes the mad behaved toward each other with delicate courtesy . She did not want to intrude on a desperate inner battle or mind loop . Sybil met her gaze , strolled the length of the ward in wary reconnaissance , then let her long body down beside her . “
35479	35481	35345	35348	Dios Bendiga Nuestro Hogar	420	" . "
35497	35498	35491	35491	Sybil	418	" “
35517	35612	35508	35509	a coven	1508	" Sybil really did think she was a witch , that she could heal with herbs , that she could cast spells both black and white . They 'd had an argument last time about those names . Connie had told Sybil that black magic for bad and white for good were racist terms . Finally Sybil had agreed to name the magics red , for blood vengeance , and green , for growing and healing . She wondered if Sybil remembered , or if she had gone back to the old names . 83 "
35625	35629	35622	35622	you	418	" she asked . "
35640	35668	35634	35634	I	0	" Sybil held up her bony elegant hands with white marks for the rings she wore , which they always took from her over her roaring protests . “
35713	35724	35726	35726	you	0	" Gently Sybil touched a lock of Connie 's hair . “
35731	35744	35726	35726	you	0	” She smiled at Sybil and began to tell her the story . “
35772	35806	35809	35809	your	0	” Her telling took them through the supper lines and the supper of what Sybil pronounced Toad Stew , through the evening medication line and the blank space of time until lights out . “
35818	35819	35809	35809	your	0	” "
35830	36258	35809	35809	your	0	” Sybil promised . Sybil was her best woman friend except for Dolly , who was blood , but because she lived in Albany they never managed to see each other outside the hospital . Oh , Sybil was crazy , but Connie had no trouble talking to her . Sybil was persecuted for being a practicing witch , for tening women how to heal themselves and encouraging them to leave their husbands , for being tean and crazily elegant and five feet ten in her bare long high - arched feet , for having a loud , penetrating voice and a back that would not stoop and a temper that stood up in her , lashing the tail of a lioness . Sybil did not hesitate to take to her fists against anyone , so she had a scar across her high - domed forehead coming down to take a white bite of her left eyebrow . Sybil had lost a front tooth and she had a little bald spot she could find when she wanted to show Connie where her hair had been pulled out by an attendant , the time before the time before last when she had been forcibly committed . Why did she like Sybil so much ? Her heart warmed when she saw Sybil 's long body writhing in fury . Sybil had high carved cheekbones and a square jaw , a haughty . nose and eyes of a smoky umber . On the outside she wore outrageous makeup and ringed her eyes with black , but inside they would not let her near her precious kohl . Mainly , 84 Sybil was a fighter and she fought those who threatened her , instead of hating her own self . She did n't deny herself , she had not sold herself to any man . Connie adored the way she fought and would n't give up or go under and would n't be broken - not yet . All she could give anyone in here was to have survived this far , this long . · They talked passionately , sitting side by side against a wall , sometimes interrupting the flow by half an hour or an hour , sometimes muttering out of the sides of their mouths as if they were kids talking in school . Too much animation , too obvious a pleasure in each other 's company would bring down punishment . The hospital regarded Sybil as a lesbian . Actually she had no sex life . - "
36266	36271	36273	36273	you	1513	" Sybil asked her . “
36330	36340	36378	36378	Consuelo	408	futile”—few - tile , she pronounced it , loving vowel sounds—“futile
36350	36351	36318	36318	Consuelo	408	" “
36362	36367	36353	36353	people	759	” She was grinning . “
36376	36377	36378	36378	Consuelo	408	” "
36380	36395	36378	36378	Consuelo	408	” Sybil pronounced her name carefully and with a reasonable effort at the Spanish . “
36444	36456	36428	36428	they	4700	touching"—their word for the state when inmates were responsive to things outside them--"has
36486	36487	36478	36478	you	1513	” "
36548	36550	36551	36551	I	0	" - "
36576	36577	36597	36597	I	0	” "
36588	36595	36597	36597	I	0	” Connie said a little sadly . “
36634	36635	36636	36636	People	759	” “
36643	37043	36636	36636	People	759	” Mrs. Perlmutter said , her hand inside her hospital - issue dress , feeling her own breast . At odd moments , the better days , the mental hospital reminded her of being in college those almost two years she had had before she got knocked up . The similarity lay in the serious conversations , the leisure to argue about God and Sex and the State and the Good . Except for college students , who else in the world was sitting around talking philosophy ? Outside , whole days of her life would leak by and she would n't have one good thoughtful conversation . Sybil was a smart person , not street smart like Claud but thoughtful about the way things were and the way they might be . Outside , who talked to her ? On Ward L-6 every day smelled the same , looked the same , sounded the same . Patients rotated through their private cycles of night and day , touching and withdrawing , snowed by the heavy drugs . She was no longer Fargo 's favorite , because she spent too much time with Sybil . Today was Friday , a dangerous day , a day of doors opening and shutting . A doctor came onto Ward L-6 , a youngish doctor with pale hair and bloodshot pale blue eyes . He arrived two hours after the time when the doctor raced through , speaking only to the nurse and attendants , while patients touching that day chased after him pleading for attention , changes in medication , furloughs , privileges , a change of ward . Calling them bird dogs , the attendants ran interference . This pale doctor was showing Fargo some papers and Fargo and the nurse were going over the patient 's ward records with him , all those comments written on each of them that could get her sent to shock or raised a niche or two nearer the gates . Even the patients not talking , not supposed to be in touch , knew something was up . Excitement rose like a hot dry wind and the women began chirping . Mrs. Martínez crawled into a corner and pushed her face against the wall . Joan began talking in what the staff called a word salad about her mother and God and the FBI , “
37158	37184	37187	37187	you	1530	” Her voice rose high in a shriek of fury but her expression did not change . From the side of her mouth Sybil asked , "
37203	37322	37324	37324	you	1533	" Indeed , both the doctor and Fargo looked straight at them and they shut up . Connie turned away , but when she cautiously glanced at the station again , the two of them were still under surveillance . Had they been acting too intimate ? Fargo jogged over and hoisted Sybil by an arm . Sybil tried to whip her arm free , but Fargo expertly pinned her . When Sybil got mad she could hold her off easily till she was hypoed , but she was more curious than angry . She drew herself up to eye the doctor along her narrow nose , making him instantly aware that she had two inches on him . “
37342	37346	37347	37347	She	1536	" she cooed . “
37354	37359	37364	37364	she	1536	” the doctor said . “
37368	37388	37360	37360	I	0	" Fargo dropped Sybil neatly , knocking her legs out from under her , and bauled up Connie instead . “
37414	37415	37405	37405	she	1536	" "
37420	37422	37405	37405	she	1536	" . “
37445	37543	37431	37431	She	1536	" The doctor turned away and Fargo let go of Connie . Weak through and through , she felt as if her bones had turned to wet rope . Her knees crumbled and she sat abruptly beside Sybil . She started to speak to Sybil , but Sybil shushed her and crept closer to the glassed - in station where the doctor and Fargo were once again looking over the ward book . Sybil was trying to lip - read through the glass . Finally they emerged and the outer door was unlocked with the usual clatter . "

40835	40841	40767	40767	I	0	” Sybil said without conviction . “
40876	41809	41810	41810	Me	0	" Ward G-2 was in G building , just as old and sad but in marginally better repair . It was a red brick barracks that stood nearer the medical building , where the doctors had interviewed her . Connie sat on her new cot and looked over the ward , trying to gauge its potentials and threats . The long room with the beds had several windows whose sills were claimed as roosting territory by cliques of women , black women on one window and whites on another . G-2 was a locked ward but a more active one . That big door by the nursing station clattered open to admit occupational therapists , an occasional volunteer , 94 and to let out patients who worked off the ward . Group therapy sessions were held on the ward twice a week . Little cabinets stood beside each of the fifty beds , and at one end of the ward card tables were set up . Along one side ran a long screened - in porch where patients could walk . They shared a day room with a men 's ward , a dim room with chairs in rows facing a locked TV . It was strange to see men around again . As she stood in line for medication , she felt like singing out with joy when she saw the little white cups with the pills inside and the cups of water . No more liquid Thorazine burning her throat hoarse . She bit hard on her cheeks to keep her face immobile . This ward meant less snowing . The line moved so slowly she had time to cover her joy , to crush it into a small corner where she could preserve it intact until she had a chance to examine it in safety . Yes , here her head would be clearer . Not today . She was new on the ward and the nurse watched closely as she took the pill . Afterward she walked slowly through the new ward , slowly as inmates always do . She remembered being horrified by that the first time she had been brought here . The drugs caused it , the heavy doping ; but also the lack of anyplace to go and the time , the leaden time , to use up . Sedately she walked through the sleeping room and into the day room . Here she would get the small exercise of walking , but she must be careful not to make it obvious she was pacing . That was an offense that would go in her record : patient paces ward . Here there was more to do but also here would be informers , spies . She walked onto the porch . It was chilly , but she did not care . She had caught a glimpse of a coat supply in a closet near the nursing station , which meant at least some patients had grounds privileges . She pressed her face to the rusty screen and stared at the trees just leafing out , the benehes , the lawns . She would be real cool , real cooperative . How she wanted to walk on that grass below ! Her move down to G-2 must prove to be a small step closer to getting out altogether - closer to the big free open daylight out there . Future : Dragung VEL CARE 95 Five : ONNIE sat on the porch with a towel around her shoulders for warmth . The chilly drizzly June day smelled like a basement under the low gray sky . She was so glad to be outside , even on the porch whose rusted screens gave a sepia wash to the walks and brick buildings , that she did not care if her behind hurt from the chill of the warped floorboards . She felt a keen enjoyment too of being alone for the first time since isolation . No one else had come out in the damp and the cold . She gloried in breathing outdoor air , in seeing more than four walls , in smelling trees instead of medicine and diarrhea and disinfectant . The gray of the day soothed her . Strong colors would have burned her eyes . Every day was a lesson in how starved the eyes could grow for hue , for reds and golds ; how starved the ears could grow for conga drums , for the blare of traffic , for dogs barking , for the baseball games chattering from TVs , for voices talking flatly , conversationally , with rising excitement in Spanish , for children playing in the streets , the Puerto Rican children whose voices sounded faster , harder than Chicano Spanish , as if there were more metal in their throats . She felt Luciente pressing on her clearly for the first time since they had let her out of seclusion : not those brushes of presence that rose and faded but the solid force of concentration bearing around her . She resisted . To sit on the porch was still new , in a convalescent pleasure 96 like the first time out of bed after a long illness , Still , she felt Luciente pressing on her and it was like , oh , refusing to answer the door to a friend who knew she was at home . How could she think of Luciente as a friend ? But she had begun to . “

Luciente let her out and on the far side of the screen door she paused and buried the house and its inhabitants with that gesture of disdain . They followed the cat out . The rose on the hut was in full bloom , its scent spicing the air . The roses were luscious semidouble white cups marked on the skirts with dark crimson . "

Perhaps it was the lighter clothing , perhaps it was a matter of expectations anyhow , Luciente now looked like a woman . Luciente 's face and voice and body now seemed female if not at all feminine ; too confident , too unselfconscious , too aggressive and sure and graceful in the wrong kind of totally coordinated way to be a woman : yet a woman .

She realized that except for the creaking of windmills , this was the first sound of machinery she had heard here . Indeed , the door sensed them and opened , admitting them to an antechamber , then sliding shut to trap them between inner and outer doors in a blue light . "

A big black man leaning comfortably on a tank painted over with eels and water lilies waved to them . “

He was a big - boned , well - muscled man with some fat around his midriff , and he moved more slowly than Luciente , with the majesty and calm of a big ship . He steered placidly among the strange apparatus , the tanks and machines and closed compartments , something that beat slowly against the wall like a great heart , the padded benches stuck here and there . Either Bee was bald or he shaved his head , and the sleeves of his rose work shirt were rolled up to reveal on each bicep a tattoo -though the colors were more subtle and the drawing finer than any she had seen . On his left arm he had , not the cartoon of a bee , but a Japanese - looking drawing of a honeybee in flight . On his right he wore a shape something like a breaking wave . “
44539	44661	44536	44537	stronger babies	1756	” He pressed a panel and a door slid aside , revealing seven human babies joggling slowly upside down , each in a sac of its own inside a larger fluid receptacle . Connie gaped , her stomach also turning slowly upside down . All in a sluggish row , babies bobbed . Mother the machine . Like fish in the aquarium at Coney Island . Their eyes were closed . One very dark female was kicking . Another , a pink male , she could see clearly from the oversize penis , was crying . Languidly they drifted in a blind school . Bee pressed something and motioned her to listen near the port . The heartbeat , voices speaking . "

44957	45074	45075	45075	I	0	” The way he picked up on that question as if it had just been asked , the way a question floated in him patiently until he was ready to answer it : a memory of sweet and of jagged pain . Maybe she just had a weakness for big black men soft in the belly who moved with that massive grace , although Claud had moved differently . Because of his blindness Claud had held his head a little to the side . She had always thought of a bird . Birds turned the side of the head toward you because their eyes were on the sides , and Claud . saw with his ears . “
45116	45141	45142	45142	I	0	” Luciente started to say something but visibly checked herself . Bee beamed , ambling toward another tank where he opened the viewing port . "

45530	45611	45612	45612	You	1782	" Outside she took a deep breath of salty air and detached herself from Bee . Claud 's sore delicate pride , like an orchid with teeth . What could a man of this ridiculous . Podunk future , when babies were born from machines and people negotiated diplomatically with cows , know about how it had been to grow up in America black or brown ? Pain had honed Claud keen . This man was a child by comparison . “

46071	46439	46068	46069	Three mothers	1817	” She thought suddenly of Three Kings Day and the Anglo Christmas carol that Angelina had learned off the TV . She could hear Angie 's fluty voice singing monotonously but with a limpid joy in monotony ( the security ): We three kings of Oregon are bearing gifts we travels a far . Tears burned her lids . Angelina , Angelina , if you had three mothers like me , you 'd be dead instead of sold off to some clean - living couple in Larchmont . They said you were lucky to be taken at four . I did n't understand till I got out what they 'd done ! Lucky to be taken from me . Angelina , child of my sore and bleeding body , child of my sad marriage that never fit right , like a pair of cheap shoes that sprouts a nail in the sole . But you fit right . 105 The nurse said I would have to show you , but you reached right for my breast . You suckled right away . I remember how you grabbed with your small pursed mouth at my breast and started drawing milk from me , how sweet it felt . How could anyone know what being a mother means who has never carried a child nine months heavy under her heart , who has never borne a baby in blood and pain , who has never suckled a child . Who got that child out of a machine the way that couple , white and rich , got my flesh and blood . All made up already , a canned child , just add money . What do they know of motherhood ? She was sitting against the wall on the porch , tears trickling from her eyes . Had pain broken the hallucination ? She did not care . She hated them , the bland bottleborn monsters of the future , born without pain , multicolored like a litter of puppies without the stigmata of race and sex . pan - vacom - etchena 106 Six NOW listen , ladies , Mrs. Richard said , wagging her fat forefinger . “
46465	46676	46461	46461	I	0	" . It was an aspirin box of dope that Glenda had got from her boyfriend on the men 's side . Glenda was married and so was her boyfriend , but nobody counted that against them . Outside , it would end ; they would be stuck back in the frame they had fallen from , with a new glue of fear to hold them there . Romances between patients reminded Connie of grade school affairs , a matter of catching a glimpse at a high window , sending a note on a cart , holding hands briefly in the common day room , touching for an instant at group therapy , dancing together at a Christmas party . Sometimes patients with grounds privileges were rumored to fuck in a storage room or behind a hedge , but that was mostly fantasy . For staff , it was different . Mrs. Richard and Nurse Wright reminded her of grade school teachers anyhow . Her first school had n't been that bad . She had gone with Luis hand in hand . All the children had been Mexican and the school within walking distance . No , the grade school she remembered with a shudder was her Chicago grade school . "

46704	46780	46697	46697	Consoola	457	" Luis had mastered that Anglo sound and taught it to the rest of them , hitting them with his fists until they said it as he did . Luis punching her in the arm was better than the white teacher looking at her with that bored knowledge that she would fail and fail again to say the sound that seemed to have been invented to shame her . Luis did not teach them to say "
46783	46795	46697	46697	Consoola	457	” Luis 's word of choice for his finally successful lesson was “
46798	46799	46697	46697	Consoola	457	” "
46814	47123	46807	46807	Teacher	1822	” Here she approached the nursing station and begged for a scrap of paper , a pencil , a cigarette , a light , a chance for one word with the doctor , permission to make a phone call . Everything but being tied down drugged blind or wheeled off to electroshock was a privilege . A job off the ward , a chance to take a walk , a candy bar . One of the privileges was a trip to the beauty shop , where they made up women her age to look exactly like women her age made up . She would n't come out of there looking like Mrs. Polcari . Last time she had been released , the beauty shop had done a job on her like Dolly 's mother , Carmel , did on the Puerto Rican women who came to her to be stuffed and cooked for weddings , important parties . She had looked ten years out of style , covered with funny wry curls and with a quarter inch of mask emphasizing every line , with green eyelids and a bright orange mouth and thickened lashes caked with mascara on the front of her like new awnings on a pawnshop window . When she had arrived at the welfare hotel where they had her for the first months - junkies in the halls and ten kids to a room with a stopped - up - sink - she was greeted by that garish face of an elderly doll lurid with the grime of traveling . Stretched out on the bed , she imagined Claud 's ghost touching her skin with his knowing fingers , those fingers faster than the rest of him and ending in sensitive bulbs . How he would have complained about what was smeared over her cheeks . "
47163	47819	47820	47820	You	1825	” Claud made love as if he had all the time in the world . He might not feel like it for a week , he might disappear , 108 he might feel too low and mean . But when he came to it , he took his sweet time . He loved up every bit of her . He would stroke the silky skin on the underside of her arms until her breasts would begin to burn , he would play with her breasts with light teasing and then he would take great handfuls and nuzzle and suck , until her belly ached with wanting . He would rub his thing against her languidly , slowly , slowly he would slip in and then ease out , slip in and ease out until she was thrusting him in herself with her hand . After he came , he would pause a little but he would stay hard . Then he would go on and go on . He would be so patient and so deliberate with her , so slow and easy , that she could give herself up to loving him back , to enjoying his coming , to the feeling of their skins touching , knowing that she would have her pleasure opening out full and slow in her . She had gone into a bar on Second Avenue — one of the few bars with a mixed black and Puerto Rican clientele - looking for Eddie , who 'd stopped paying child support . She was sitting at a table alone , low in mind , feeling she must look as if she wanted to be picked up . She had noticed Claud at the back having a drink with some friends , just as she warily noticed every man who came and went . She held a newspaper propped in front of her and nursed a warm beer , hoping that Eddie or one of his compadres would walk through the door . After some banter with the bartender , Claud started to play his saxophone : blues , spirituals , some popular songs . She was glad . He played all right , but she was glad because she had something to be doing sitting there : she could watch the big black man with the opaque glasses playing saxophone and she could be beating time to music , and only from the corner of her eye keep a watch on the door . Not till Claud finished and passed the hat did she realize he was blind . That took her off guard , so that when he came back to her table , returned the quarter she had dropped in the hat and asked if he could sit down and buy her a beer , she had agreed — not to be rude , because his blindness took her off guard . This rotten place , it gave her nothing to do and too much time to do it in . Here she was brooding on Claud again . She could n't take it . Remembering him just cut her to bleeding hunks . Dead . Ten - thirty . She had been up for four hours and the 109 big event had been waiting in line for breakfast for half an hour . On the ward it was a bad day . Mrs. Richard found the sixteen - year - old black girl , Sylvia , leaning against the radiator with the side of her face burned . She was dragged off to seclusion , numb with drugs , and whatever they did to her would not include treating the burn . Then old Mrs. Stein came out of the toilet with shit rubbed in her hair , and while one of the attendants was dragging her back in , Sharma suddenly began to punch Glenda . “
47870	48169	47862	47862	You	1825	” By eleven - thirty half the seclusion rooms on the ward were full and the patients lined up for an extra - heavy dose of tranks , given in liquid form that burned the throat raw and made her hoarse . She could feel minds stirring like poplars in a storm all through the ward , and occasionally a brittle branch would break off and crash to the floor . They were angry about being kept in , with none of the minute breaks in routine to look forward to that made a life on G-2 . She sat on the floor in a place where she could catch a glimpse of a whole window full of nothing but leaves if she held her head just right . If she sat at the right angle , she could n't see the other buildings and the green could fill her eyes . The medication was dragging her down , filling her mind with cotton fluff and odd hot pieces of hallucination and memory . Her head felt swollen : the heads of those embryos floating in the brooder , those oversized knowing heads floating upside down behind glass . She wanted to sleep , but patients were not allowed to lie down during the daytime . Finally an event : time to line up for lunch . They shuffled into line , they wandered about as the attendants made them stand straight . They waited and waited for the door to unlock . All the wards in G building went to lunch downstairs , but on a staggered schedule . Glenda , with a face swollen from Sharma 's attack , came and stood next to her . Waited to see if she would speak . Connie asked , “
48175	48176	48177	48177	She	1834	” “
48186	48187	48188	48188	I	0	" “

48219	48237	48215	48215	attendants	5372	" She waited . She knew Glenda was talking about herself and had something pressing to say . “
48242	48260	48215	48215	attendants	5372	" Mrs. Richard was braying . She was afraid of the patients and they all sensed it . “
48274	48275	48276	48276	She	460	” “
48286	48287	48288	48288	Sybil	418	" “
48290	48308	48288	48288	Sybil	418	” She immediately flashed on her body under a sheet , the long auburn hair flying out . “
48316	48317	48311	48311	they	5372	” "
48340	48341	48327	48327	She	424	" "
48351	48352	48353	48353	They	5372	" "
48365	48424	48359	48359	they	5372	" Glenda peered into her face , then fled away farther back into the line . She wanted to lie down . She wanted to crawl under a table . Would Sybil know her afterward ? Sometimes after shock inmates did n't remember friends or lovers . She felt low and mean . Sybil had had shock before . “
48433	48499	48500	48501	Mrs. Ramos	340	” Sybil said . Sybil would fight them ; but they were knocking her out , they were running the savage bolts through her soul . Sybil unconscious was merely another helpless woman . Deliberately , quietly she got out of line and sat down on her cot . Mrs. Richard trotted after her , her small mouth pursing up in a pout of alarm . “
48515	48516	48500	48501	Mrs. Ramos	340	” "
48527	48542	48519	48519	I	0	” She tried to speak with quiet dignity but the medication slurred her tongue . "
48554	48608	48549	48549	I	0	" She read fear in the eyes of Mrs. Richard , who hated the patients , whose hands shook slightly whenever she had to touch one of them , who gave out a sour stench of fear that roused Connie like the smell of gas escaping from the open cocks of a stove . “
48631	48632	48549	48549	I	0	" “
48661	48686	48609	48610	Mrs. Ramos	340	” She tried to speak distinctly but was disgusted to hear her thick tongue slurring the words as if she were drunk . · 111 "
48712	49032	48701	48703	All the others	1842	" Actually Glenda had stepped out and was wandering among the cots . Connie waited to see what Mrs. Richard would do , expecting her to call the nurse and bundle her back in line . But her little rebellion had to be punished . They threw her into seclusion . Lying on the floor , she felt like a fool . But how could she go down to lunch like a sheep while Sybil burned ? She slept awhile , hot fitful sleep . The room stank of old shit . She did not look around for fear of finding it . She banged on the door , hoping they would come and let her use the bathroom , but no one appeared . She was sitting in the Boca de Oro , Comidas Chinas y Criollas , a small Cuban - Chinese restaurant with familysized booths on 116th Street . She and Claud liked to go there . Angie was never much of an eater and in restaurants she inclined more to whining than to eating . But Angie liked the Boca de Oro , partly for the plain buttered noodles the waiter would serve her without making a big scene , and partly for a mural she liked . Connie told Claud he was lucky he did n't have to look at it : prancing señoritas in towering mantillas , with a bull that resembled a fat dog about to sneeze . They sat in a booth , a more real family in their assorted colors and sizes and shapes than Eddie and Angie and she had ever made up , with Claud taking one side of the booth by himself and his cane on Angie 's side for her to play with . Connie and Angie sat facing him , while Angie squirmed with pleasure and asked to go to the bathroom every five minutes . “
49041	49133	49033	49033	You	1843	" she kept telling Claud . Angie was fascinated by men 's and women 's bathrooms and why they used the same one at home but they could n't use the same one here . Lately Angie asked questions about toilets for hours . It drove Connie crazy . The more irritated she grew , the more Angie would push her with questions . Angie had a gift for sensing when her mother did n't want to talk about a subject , and a vivid and driving urge to know why . "
49141	49148	49149	49153	A special detective captain cop	1848	” Claud told Angie one time . “
49155	49579	49580	49580	Luciente	309	” Connie was serene with pleasure : pleasure that they had some money , that they were together , that they were being a good family , that Angie was behaving and eating 112 her noodles , that Claud was sitting there vast and beaming and solid and warm . Like the sun his presence shone on her . She ate from his dish , she ate from her own , she nibbled a little of what Angie would not finish . Everything was spicy and good . It was spring , just after Easter , and Claud had given her money for a new dress . The dress was turquoise , fitted at the waist and swinging out when she walked . Claud said it felt good and sleek . She had touched up her hair just Saturday and then used the cream rinse that made it feel soft for Claud . She was bathing in a pool of sunshine . They were busted two weeks later . She was in isolation , crying . Claud , Angie . The courtappointed lawyer told her to cop a plea and she ended up with a suspended sentence as accomplice to a pickpocket . But she spent weeks in jail before the trial and Angie had been put in the children 's shelter for the first time . Her probation officer would not permit contact with the man she thought of as her husband . The State said her husband was Eddie . She 'd never had the money to divorce him for desertion . What was the point ? Only sometimes she felt as if the name Ramos was a heavy load , a great dead bough she lugged on her shoulders . Its thickness was the body of a thin but bony man , the roughness of skin closed against her . Claud had been open to her and everybodythe judge , the probation officer , Luis , everybody - had tried to make her ashamed of being with him . Black and blind . She could not stand remembering ! She had felt disgusted by Luciente and Bee , but she did not care . She had to get out of here . She had to turn off her memory . She tried to open her mind , to invite . For a long , long time nothing stirred . Nothing but time sticking to her like cold grease . Then at last she felt something . At once she begged , “
49586	49592	49593	49593	Grasp	446	” The presence grew stronger . “
49609	49610	49603	49607	a powerful and unusual mix	1850	” "
49616	49617	49603	49607	a powerful and unusual mix	1850	" “
49642	49658	49659	49659	We	1851	” She felt Luciente 's firm embrace and then she stood in her hut . 113 “
49666	49671	49659	49659	We	1851	” Luciente hugged her . "
49677	49678	49672	49672	You	309	” "
49697	49698	49692	49692	you	309	” “
49727	49796	49709	49709	I	0	” Luciente was wearing shorts and a sleeveless shirt . She reminded Connie of an athlete , of a woman tennis player ; except that they were hardly ever as dark as Luciente . Bee , on the bed 's edge , wore a long red and black robe covered with fine embroidery that stiffened it , with a softly rolled hood cast back on his broad shoulders . “
49799	49809	49709	49709	I	0	” Luciente urged her , huskiness catching with haste . “
49817	50058	49812	49812	Bee	378	” Indeed , squatting carefully outside so as not to stain their costumes were two women as dressed up as Bee , women she recognized from the lunch table . One wore a long shirt and leggings of soft pale deerskin much worked with shell and quill appliqué ; she had braided her long black hair with strips of dyed leather into a tower precariously fastened . The other 's chestnut hair was loose and she wore long filigree earrings and a flowing blue gown . With quick grace both women rose to greet them . Sitting a little apart on a stone was a fair - haired girl , yes , of thirteen or so . This child was easy for Connie to distinguish because her cotton shirt was open all the way down like a jacket , and her small cups of breasts were visible as she got up and turned toward them . The skin of her chest looked tattooed . Connie stared . As they moved into a close group , she could see it was paint . The girl wore pants and that open shirt and had at her feet a basket , which now she swung up to wear like a rucksack . She also picked up a bow and slung it over her shoulder . Connie could see at her waist a knife sheath , hanging under the shirt - as - jacket . “
50076	50088	50070	50070	Connie	554	" Bee turned to her , stately today in his movements . “

50836	50844	50845	50845	We	1868	” Bee smiled at her almost sadly . “

50903	50914	50915	50915	I	0	" Luxembourg said in her soft , rather deep voice . "
50943	50949	50937	50937	You	1879	" Innocente said to Connie . "
50966	50972	50973	50973	It	1882	” She turned to Bee . “

51116	51124	51114	51114	Zo	466	" - Luciente took Connie 's hand . "
51153	51164	51147	51147	We	1890	" 116 Bee shook out the folds of his robe . “
51228	51278	51279	51279	You	1885	” Innocente strode off and they fell in behind . Soon they were ambling together , Innocente arm in arm with Luxembourg , who murmured in her ear soft cautions and advice , while Luciente and Otter walked linked , Luciente telling a broad story about Neruda 's naming . “
51297	51302	51279	51279	You	1885	” Connie asked Bee . "
51324	51332	51305	51305	We	1890	" · Luciente leaned close , grinning . “

51518	51526	51511	51511	they	877	” Gently Bee adjusted Innocente 's jacket . “
51540	51668	51669	51669	Zo	466	" • As they came over a small rise , they faced a bigger hill . Cut into its side was what appeared to be a hangar , its top standing open like a box with the lid up . Three grasshoppery machines the size of police helicopters stood inside . The hangar was built much larger than needed to accommodate them , as if sometimes it might hold more of them or something else besides . A blond woman wearing overalls came toward them from the floater in front . She was tanned , her cropped hair was shoved up in a bandanna , her nose reddened by 117 the sun , her eyes wide and blue , and her wiry arms were daubed with grease . “
51682	51683	51677	51677	You	451	" “
51693	51694	51684	51684	You	451	" “

51732	51733	51729	51729	you	451	" "
51743	52083	51738	51738	they	1908	” Slowly other people came drifting toward the hangar from the cornfields , the intensively cultivated gardens , from the fooder and brooder , from huts scattered among the gardens , from the free - form buildings they called justgrews . From the river docks where she could see a variety of conventional and odd , high - in - the - water fishing boats , diving gear , nets and winches , more people strolled toward them . They embraced Bee , Otter , and Luxembourg , they waited for Innocente to leave prowling over the machine so they could greet her . Luciente remained with Connie up on the rise , a little apart . This day had the feeling of a slightly formal but familial occasion , of a great big clan saying goodbye to someone going off to the army or getting married . Of course they were far too many for a real family . Not even her own Comacho clan back in El Paso , with additional strength up on a visit from Chihuahua , could muster such numbers to see them off when they left in their old Ford for Chicago and the promise of work in the steel mills , the last time she had seen gathered in one spot so many people related by blood . Except of course they were n't . Nobody here knew what that meant . They just acted as if they were . They were kissing and hugging and Otter was beginning to weep . Innocente finally turned from her perhaps embarrassed fumbling with the floater to let people greet her . Even she did not seem to find the embraces or the tears upsetting . Luciente had left Connie to hug Bee , and both of them were crying . Big fat tears rolled down Bee 's broad face . Imagine Claud crying ! Even when they sentenced him , he had grinned and shrugged and said out of the corner of his mouth , "
52104	52142	52095	52095	you	1909	” Once again they reminded her of children , even the men . Only Innocente did not weep , stubbornly eager . Blowing her nose on a big multicolored handkerchief , 118 Luciente clambered back to her . "
52149	52175	52147	52147	my	0	" she was sighing as she came . Bee and Jackrabbit were embracing now , that skinny rambling kid who was Luciente 's lover too . "
52254	52255	52241	52241	you	1914	” “
52360	52476	52336	52338	a third mother	1924	” Luciente blew her nose again , emphatically , in the handkerchief of complex and gaudy pattern ( a gift handkerchief , Connie thought : I bet people still give each other handkerchiefs when they ca n't think of anything else ) . The drifting to and fro , the greeting and well - wishing , the embracing and weeping , the patting and hugging and hand clasping , rose to a frenzied peak and Bee , Otter , and Luxembourg in their finery climbed into the floater with Innocente . Luxembourg was piloting . They all waved and shouted . Baskets of lunch were handed in and what looked like a bottle of champagne . “

52525	52692	52693	52693	Luciente	309	” At last the floater , painted with a swirly design in pastels , put out a bag apparatus above it and rose slowly , gracefully , and quietly . It soared to perhaps a thousand feet and then sailed off , with another device turning and twittering on it . Smoothly it paddled off through the air silent as a balloon and was soon gone . Once again Luciente blew her ' nose in the handkerchief of many colors and stuffed it in a pocket of her shorts as Jackrabbit strode from the eddies of leavetaking to hug her . Yes , they were not like Anglos ; they were more like Chicanos or Puerto Ricans in the touching , the children in the middle of 119 things , the feeling of community and fiesta . Then , after all that carrying on , everybody walked away cheerful enough , serene . Jackrabbit sauntered with his hand cupped on the nape of Luciente 's neck . "
52703	52707	52693	52693	Luciente	309	” Connie asked . "

53037	53079	53029	53029	you	309	" She shrugged wearily , passing the huts crawling with grape vines and roses , the orchards hung with small green fruit , the covered tanks where fish were spawning under translucent domes . Growth seemed to swarm over the land . “
53108	53130	53104	53104	she	4827	" She wished sharply for a cigarette , but she had not seen any here and she remembered Luciente 's fear . “

53652	53714	53644	53644	you	1949	" They were walking a broad path beside the tidal river . 121 Every twenty feet wooden benches stood . White Oak took a seat at a table , inviting them to stare at the flow of the currents , the tide washing slowly in . A high in the water Goat skimmed past them , going downriver against the tide . "
53912	53938	53940	53940	Diana	386	" When she stopped short , the others were silent but did not seem scared or judgmental . As usual , Luciente spoke y first . “

54131	54257	54127	54127	she	1987	" I went mad with fear . In the madhouse I met Bolivar and he was good for me in learning to say that initial ' I want , I want . I had played a lot as a child with paints and with holies and I felt ... most alive then . I had to do that in the center of my life . I had to follow my comp 122 through and even push it . So Bolivar and I went to study with Marika of Amherst . Then I studied in Provincetown with Blackfish . You see , I 'm a needy type and every time I lack , I add on . The next time I jagged , I grabbed Luciente . "

54656	54724	54610	54610	Luciente	309	" Whenever we decide we 're ripe to join a work base , we fuse as full members . We share the exciting jobs and the dull jobs . We do n't think telling people what to do is a real world skill . Now , joining a base ... Some people 123 stay on where they study . Others go away to study and then come home- "
54725	54731	54732	54732	Jackrabbit	377	" Place matters to us , ”
54735	54797	54798	54798	Connie	554	" A sense of land , - of village and base and family . We 're strongly rooted . People of your time were n't ? So I 've been told - lacking Luciente 's time traveling . On per it 's wasted , too . I bet that one talks a blue streak in your century and looks at nothing . "
54801	54825	54798	54798	Connie	554	“ Where I am now , there 's not much to see . . . . You ... went mad a second time ? ”
54826	54850	54851	54851	Luciente	309	" Jackrabbit 's jealous of my assignment . Jackrabbit catches like you , but person transmutes everything ! ... I always choose catchers ! ”
54859	54915	54851	54851	Luciente	309	" I 'm jealous of everybody 's gifts . I want to be everybody and feel everything and do everything . Wherever I am , where I 'm not plagues me . As long as I do n't have to get up too early in the morning to do it all . He stretched languidly . “

To find out she had been in an institution scared people - how it scared them . Not a good risk for a job . They feared madness might prove contagious . Jackrabbit looked into her eyes with piercing curiosity . “

We build jizers , diving equipment , and the best nets this side of Orleans , on the Cape .

56365	56427	56358	56358	Jackrabbit	377	" How many hours does it take to grow food and make useful objects ? Beyond that we care for our brooder , cook in our fooder , care for animals , do basic routines like cleaning , politic and meet . That leaves hours to talk , to study , to play , to love , to enjoy the river . "

The old folks story about how they used to have to stiff it all the time . How long the struggle was to turn things over and change them . After , what a mess the whole ying - and - yan of it was from peak to sea . ”

Grasp , after we 128 dumped the jobs telling people what to do , counting money and moving it about , making people do what they do n't want or bashing them for doing what they want , we have lots of people to work . Kids work , old folks work , women and men work . We put a lot of work into feeding everybody without destroying the soil , keeping up its health and fertility . With most everybody at it part time , nobody breaks their back and grubs dawn to dust like old - time farmers . ... Instance , in March I might work sixteen hours . In December , four ... "

56665	56675	56706	56706	Jackrabbit	377	" We just passed the pillow and comforter factory . ”

56884	56893	56837	56837	Luciente	309	" No , methane gas from composting wastes . "
56894	56904	56905	56905	she	2020	“ Okay , you can automate a whole factory , ”
56915	56940	56905	56905	she	2020	“ So why do I see people grubbing around broccoli plants picking off caterpillars ? Why is everybody running around on foot or bicycles ? ”
56941	56987	56988	56988	Luciente	309	“ We have so much energy from the sun , so much from wind , so much from decomposing wastes , so much from the waves , so much from the river , so much from alcohol from wood , so much from wood gas . ”
56996	57050	56988	56988	Luciente	309	“ That 's a fixed amount . Manufacturing and mining are better done by machines . Who 129 wants to go deep into the earth and crawl through tunnels breathing rock dust and never seeing the sun ? Who wants to sit in a factory sewing the same four or five comforter patterns ? "
57051	57059	57060	57060	Jackrabbit	377	“ There are ten , in fact , ”
57063	57068	57060	57060	Jackrabbit	377	“ I counted them . "
57069	57081	57082	57082	Luciente	309	" Only you have been in enough beds to be sure , "
57261	57266	57267	57267	Jackrabbit	377	" Smells like rain , "

57301	57318	57319	57319	she	309	“ Hope Bee and Otter get back before the storm . Lux too , I mean , "
57323	57337	57319	57319	she	309	" When I was on my naming , it rained every damned day , ”

57403	57412	57413	57413	she	309	" How come they are n't in school ? ”
57416	57425	57413	57413	she	309	“ Is school out already for the summer ? ”
57426	57431	57432	57432	Luciente	309	“ That is school , ”
57442	57452	57432	57432	Luciente	309	“ This one is lamb's - quarters , no ? ”
57458	57464	57453	57454	one kid	2035	" Can you eat it ? "
57465	57468	57413	57413	she	309	“ Fasure . ”
57470	57532	57453	57454	one kid	2035	“ Look at the shape of the pea flowers . Most legumes have irregular flowers with five petals — see , the two lower ones join in a keel , like the keel on the fishing boats . The two at the sides are like spread wings . Then you have one on top . Most legumes have leaves like these . ”
57533	57546	57453	57454	one kid	2035	“ Alternate . Compound . With these twisty things that hold on ? "
57547	57585	57586	57586	His	2033	“ Tendrils . Some have thorns instead . After we 're done weeding , we 'll look for a tree that 's evolved in a typical legume way , that has thorns a couple of inches long . ”
57600	57621	57597	57597	she	309	“ But they ca n't possibly learn as much that way as they would in a classroom with a book ! "
57622	57635	57636	57636	Jackrabbit	377	“ They can read . We all read by four or so , "
57639	57704	57636	57636	Jackrabbit	377	“ But who wants to grow up with a head full of facts in boxes ? We never leave school and go to work . We 're always working , always studying . We think , what person thinks person knows has to be tried out all the time . Placed against what people need . We care a lot how things are done . "
57705	57714	57715	57715	Luciente	309	“ Every seven years you get a sabbatical , ”
57718	57770	57715	57715	Luciente	309	“ You 're off production for a year and all you 're liable for is family stuff . Some go study in their field . Some learn a language or travel . Hermit in the wilderness . Pursue some line of private research . Or paint . Or write a book . ”
57779	57800	57771	57771	Connie	554	“ I see a lot of old people here . Is this building like an old folks ' home too ? ”
57871	57897	57859	57859	she	2040	“ Then Green Fire came to Box Turtle and when Box Turtle saw , Box Turtle closed per box tight with a hissing of air . ”
57908	57943	57898	57898	Her	2040	“ Green Fire sat down quietly , tucking per feet under , and waited . And waited . And waited . Finally Box Turtle slowly opened the shell a little peek and peered out . ”

58087	58096	58055	58056	Box Turtle	489	" Sappho perself made that tale long ago . ”
58106	58141	58097	58097	Jackrabbit	377	“ Many people now tell that story , but none better . At Icebreaking I taped per telling with the latest varia for the holifile . Sappho 's tales have great strength and radiance . "
58147	58154	58144	58144	her	309	“ We never answered your question . ”
58259	58414	58251	58251	Luciente	309	“ We believe old people and children are kin . There 's more space at both ends of life . That closeness to birth and tó death makes a common concern with big questions and basic patterns . We think old people , because of their distance from the problems of their own growing up , hold more patience and can be quieter to hear what children want . Not everyone who teaches the young is old - we all teach . The kids work with us . We try to share what we have learned and what we do n't know .... I think maybe growing up is less mysterious with us since the adult world is n't separate . What better place to learn anatomy than in a clinic ? What better place to learn botany than a field of corn ? What better place to study mechanics than a repair shop ? ”
58415	58430	58251	58251	Luciente	309	“ How can Red Star repair a floater with a mob of kids underfoot ? "
58431	58437	58438	58438	Luciente	309	“ A mob of kids ? ”
58445	58535	58438	58438	Luciente	309	“ I puzzle , I admit . ... We think about kids so different it makes us crosstalk , my friend . ... We ask a lot of our kids but ... politely ? It 's not the one - to - one bind you had 132 with your daughter , from what you say . We have more space , more people to love us . We grow up closest to our mothers , but we swim close to all our mems — or some , at least ! ”
58539	58581	58536	58536	Luciente	309	“ We have handfriends and pillowfriends among other children in the children 's house . ... It 's hard for me to inknow what it would feel like - to love only one and have only one soul to love me . "
58887	58904	58905	58905	Luciente	309	" You think because we do not bear live , we can not love our children , ”
58924	58933	58905	58905	Luciente	309	“ But we do , with whole hearts . "
59074	59101	59102	59102	He	407	“ I hear you , I hear you . You almost blew the kenner off my wrist , you rascal ! What a pair of lungs . ”
59109	59127	59128	59128	He	407	“ They can hear you ten miles out on the shelf farm , you hairy little beast ! ”
59461	59471	59472	59472	she	554	“ I suppose you do it all with hormones , ”
59476	59512	59472	59472	she	554	" At least two of the three mothers agree to breast - feed . The way we do it , no one has enough alone , but two or three together share breast - feeding . ”
59513	59527	59472	59472	she	554	“ Why bother ? Do n't tell me you could n't make formula ? "
59528	59551	59638	59638	She	2096	“ But the intimacy of it ! We suspect loving and sensual enjoyment are rooted in being held and sucking and cuddling . "
59552	59566	59472	59472	she	554	" Where are the babies from the empty cradles ? Are they sick ? "
59567	59608	59472	59472	she	554	“ Outside with mothers or somebody ! Oftentimes when we 're working , we take the baby in a backpack . They get fresh air . When breast - feeding ends , everybody who feels like it lugs them around . ”
59609	59627	59472	59472	she	554	" Suppose you took Barbarossa 's baby and he wanted it . Would n't he get sore ? ”
59628	59637	59638	59638	She	2096	“ What are kenners for ? You ask . "
59701	59718	59677	59680	The person in green	2098	“ Well , at least you 're not so crazy about ecology that you wash diapers . "
59719	59737	59677	59680	The person in green	2098	" They 're made from cornhusks and cobs , and they compost . Very soft . Feel . ”

59937	59947	59919	59919	Connie	554	“ Gone to play . This house seduces you . ”
59948	59971	59875	59878	The person in green	2098	" Nobody chose how it grows how it flows . How it grows how it glows in the heart of the rose ... "
59992	60010	60011	60011	she	554	“ Except in the nursery and among the very young , the kids do n't have toys , ”
60017	60058	60011	60011	she	554	“ Most of what children must learn , they learn by doing . Under five , fasure they need toys to learn coordination , dexterity ; they practice tenderness on dolls . . . . I 'm looking for Magdalena . ”
60065	60161	60062	60062	her	554	“ Magdalena ? Ah , person is coming . Magdalena is unusual . Person does not switch jobs but is permanent head of this house of children . It is per calling . Sometimes a gift expresses itself so strongly , like Jackrabbit 's need to create color and form , like Magdalena 's need to work with children , that it shapes a life . Person must not do what person can not domyou have heard us say this a hundred times ; but likewise , person must do what person has to do . "
60245	60264	60265	60265	Luciente	309	" Magdalena has no family . Person wants this instead . Person is chaste and solitary among adults , ”
60274	60281	60268	60268	Magdalena	493	“ You mean an old maid ? ”
60282	60296	60265	60265	Luciente	309	“ I do n't know this term . You speak it with contempt ? "
60297	60314	60268	60268	Magdalena	493	“ Yeah , it 's an insult . A woman who ca n't get a man . ”
60315	60346	60265	60265	Luciente	309	" Connie , we do n't get each other . And we respect people who do n't want to couple . It 's per way : the way for Magdalena . "
60360	60369	60356	60356	Magdalena	493	“ Be guest , woman from the past . ”
60387	60392	60377	60377	Her	493	" I 'm Magdalena . "
60393	60416	60377	60377	Her	493	“ You 're the only woman I met here who has a real name . I mean like somebody from my block . ”
60417	60451	60452	60452	Magdalena	493	" It 's the name of a woman burned to death for witchcraft in Germany many centuries ago . A wisewoman who healed with herbs . I saw per in my naming trance . ”
60526	60651	60652	60652	Magdalena	493	“ I wanted to know about the toys . You have all those gadgets here . Compared to your huts , it 's ... fancy . Nice . But I do n't see many toys for the older kids . Ca n't you afford to get them toys ? I see nobody rich here , but I do n't see anybody poor . I think of how sad it 's been for families like mine who could never give their kids the beautiful dolls with real hair , the sleds , the bikes and racing cars they see advertised . If I had a house of children , I 'd give them every toy in the world ! I would n't hold nothing back ! ”
60659	60764	60652	60652	Magdalena	493	“ They play farming and cooking and repair and fishing and diving and manufacture and plant breeding and baby tending . When children are n't kept out of the real work , they do n't have the same need for imitation things . I have studied about the care of children in earlier ages , so I understand more than Luciente what you 're talking about . In that time , Luciente , 137 they had many toys for teaching sex roles to children . Children were kept in separate buildings all day and even after puberty were not supposed to begin full lives . ”
60951	60960	60948	60948	Connie	554	“ Are n't you going to stop them ? ”
60993	61018	60988	60988	Connie	554	“ They 're babies ! If they were . . . playing with knives you 'd stop them . What 's wrong with you ? ”
61026	61062	61021	61021	her	493	“ They learn how to use knives . , , . . Mostly they learn sex from each other . If a child has trouble , we try to heal , to help , but — "
61063	61070	60988	60988	Connie	554	“ They can hurt each other ! ”
61071	61112	61113	61113	Luciente	309	" How ? If a child is rough , the other children deal with that . If I notice a child bullying , I try to work with that child , the mothers and family , to strengthen better ways . "
61120	61137	61113	61113	Luciente	309	“ Zo , as a child you never played sex with other children ? Not ever ? ”
61153	61158	61144	61144	She	554	“ Oh . Sure . ”
61436	61439	61440	61440	she	554	“ Okay , ”
61444	61492	61440	61440	she	554	“ Maybe it do n't hurt . But I know if I saw my daughter playing that way , I 'd have to stop her . I 'd feel so guilty if I did n't ! I 'd feel like a bad mother , a rotten mother . ”
61493	61497	61498	61498	Magdalena	493	" How interesting , ”
61507	61555	61556	61556	She	493	“ Qur notions of evil center around power and greed - taking from other people their food , their liberty , their health , their land , their customs , their pride . We do n't find coupling bad unless it involves pain or is not invited . ”
61563	61570	61556	61556	She	493	“ Come . Watch a lesson . "
61644	61654	61622	61623	The boy	1590	“ Good , Sparrow ! Now without the guide . ”

61780	61821	61777	61777	Luciente	309	“ but we want to prevent overreacting - heart attacks , indigestion , panic . We want to get used to knowing exactly what we feel , so we do n't shove on other people what 's coming from inside . "
61822	61831	61832	61832	Magdalena	493	“ We want to teach inknowing and outknowing . "
61849	61894	61832	61832	Magdalena	493	“ To feel with other beings . To catch , where the ability exists — instance , so strongly in you . We teach sharpening of the senses . Coning , going down , how to reach nevel , how to slow at will . "
61895	61902	61777	61777	Luciente	309	" What is all that stuff ? "
61903	61912	61777	61777	Luciente	309	" States of consciousness . Types of feeling . "
61913	61939	61832	61832	Magdalena	493	" How can you teach somebody to feel ? From a book you can learn the multiplication tables . But how can you teach love ? "

61964	62004	62005	62005	She	493	“ We educate the senses , the imagination , the social being , the muscles , the nervous system , the intuition , the sense of beauty - as well as memory and intellect . Anyhow , we try ! ”

64212	64276	64199	64202	Long skinny white boy	2233	" She tilted back her tower of a neck and laughed , with her breasts freely jiggling against the red dress . She had her own clothing , for sure . Some attendant had made her sew up the front a couple of inches with the wrong color thread , but the dress was still shorter and fit better than anything else around . “
64295	64296	64289	64289	you	4813	” "
64301	64305	64299	64299	Skip	429	” Connie said . “

64375	64460	64461	64461	Sybil	418	” Alice 's name was called and she strolled after the nurse , swinging her broad , high ass across the waiting room . An attendant brought Sybil out of the office , and Connie half rose . Sybil saw her at once and their eyes exchanged 145 messages of hope . Fats placed Sybil in a chair far down the line . As soon as Fats turned his back , Sybil hopped up and quietly slid into the seat Alice had just left . "
64477	64488	64472	64472	they	2239	” Sybil raised an elegant bony hand to her forehead . “

64614	64622	64623	64623	We	2240	” Connie pleaded . Her voice fawned . “

64702	64708	64696	64696	you	418	" Skip asked her softly . "
64725	64743	64744	64744	They	2247	” She did not mind his asking , really . Better than thinking it and never asking . “
64792	64793	64785	64785	he	427	" “
64796	64800	64785	64785	he	427	” She smiled . “

64905	64961	64903	64903	Skip	429	” He unfolded to his feet as Fats came for him . 146 The next day rain still blew in gusts across the grounds and the porch was too wet to sit on . Sleepy with medication , she went into the day room . Sharma was standing in front of the set , frowning . “
64966	64975	64903	64903	Skip	429	" she asked Sharma as she shuffled past . "
64980	65005	64903	64903	Skip	429	” Sharma said . Something she would n't have said if the attendants had been in earshot . Patients were punished for unladylike behavior . “
65191	65249	65182	65183	my husband	1645	” She mumbled sympathy , half out on her feet . The set flickered , giving a cover to sitting in the dim room . She took a chair at the back and nodded out . She was sinking into the stuffy sleep of Thorazine when she felt Luciente 's presence and lurched unsteadily to meet her . “
65256	65266	65182	65183	my husband	1645	” she said with disappointment in her thickened voice . "
65283	65291	65275	65275	you	2262	” . Luciente peered into her face . “
65308	65338	65304	65304	I	0	” Luciente put her warm , dry hands beside Connie 's temples and pressed carefully but firmly . She began a series of exploratory pressures over Connie 's head . “
65346	65357	65304	65304	I	0	” Luciente spoke to her in a low compelling tone . “
65375	65399	65400	65400	Zo	466	" She knew she was being hypnotized and that the iron cage around her brain was lifting . The heaviness slid from her . “
65404	65450	65400	65400	Zo	466	” Luciente handed her a closely woven hat to keep off the rain , broad enough to protect her shoulders and , unlike an umbrella , not requiring a hand 147 to hold it . Off they started along the slick paths of the village . “
65472	65489	65400	65400	Zo	466	” On the end of the village beyond the fish breeding tanks stood racks of bicycles . "

65580	65596	65562	65562	It	139	” Luciente made a face , throwing her slack - clad leg over the bike . “
65613	65678	65562	65562	It	139	" They set out along a narrow paved way wandering a pleasant route over a high curved bridge across the river , under big and little trees , past roses drooping under the load of the rain , past willows , past boats and corn patches with pole beans and pumpkins interplanted , past the edge of another village marked by a bike rack .. "
65683	65697	65562	65562	It	139	” Luciente said , hitting the brakes so they squeaked to a stop . “
65750	65751	65752	65752	I	0	" "

65771	65785	65752	65752	I	0	” Luciente left the bike by a big maple and helped her off . “
65792	65798	65799	65799	Zuli	511	” She used her kenner . “
65826	65827	65805	65805	I	0	” “
65831	65853	65805	65805	I	0	" said a voice that sounded much more like a black from her own time than anybody she 'd heard here . “
65879	65880	65866	65866	You	511	” "
65888	65892	65885	65886	sweet friends	1354	" Luciente said . "
65912	65922	65899	65899	Person	5078	” She pointed to a two - story building . "
65958	65960	65943	65944	the spinners	2300	” 148 "
65967	65968	65969	65969	Fasure	384	" “
65975	66178	65971	65971	They	2301	" As they walked , she saw that courtyards were dug into the earth the level of an ample story , surrounded by dense , often thorny hedges_blackberries , raspberries . An animal or a child could n't push through . At ground level trees grew , gardens flourished , paths wound , swings hung from trees and people trotted and biked by . Goats and cows grazed , chickens ran pecking , a cat played with a dying baby rabbit . The solar heat collectors and the intakes for rain - water cisterns studded the surface like sculpture , some of them decorated with carved masks , others scalloped , inlaid with shell and glass mosaics . Luciente led her by the hand down wide steps curving into a submerged courtyard . The yard itself was paved and had in the center a big weather - beaten table with benches all around and a scattering of chairs . A chess game sat on the table half played , under a clear cover like those Connie had seen put over big cakes . The four walls around the court were of glass threaded with spidery lines almost too fine to focus on . "
66190	66193	65971	65971	They	2301	” Luciente explained “
66201	66208	65971	65971	They	2301	" Maybe they were richer here . “
66247	66346	66350	66350	they	2309	” Individual rooms opened onto courts and the courts served partly as hallways and partly as common space . Halls joined rooms on other courts . Luciente guided her through the maze , occasionally consulting her kenner to ask permission to open a door . They cut through a kitchen , where Luciente begged a taste of a hot spicy seafood stew . Only two private rooms were occupied at this time of day . In one , Luciente said , somebody was meditating . On the door was hung a paper hand with the fingers held up . "
66380	66471	66361	66361	I	0	” Erzulia 's room faced west . It was spacious , with walls entirely covered in woven and embroidered hangings , texture upon texture and color upon color . Her bed was 149 a high platform reached by a ladder , the space underneath closed in with hangings to make a dark cave of cushions , a small altar , shelves of herbs in bottles . The furniture was of a dark knobby substance that reminded her of bamboo . On the bed a strange blue costume was laid out . "
66484	66492	66480	66480	Erzulia	512	" Luciente used the old formal word . "
66503	66504	66480	66480	Erzulia	512	” “
66561	66562	66563	66563	Sappho	492	” “

66605	66618	66622	66622	she	2323	” She saw the sharp face of the corpse in the tunnel . “
66630	66631	66622	66622	she	2323	” "
66663	66841	66842	66842	We	2326	” They climbed another broad stair to the ground , where the rain was easing and dark clouds scudded over rapidly , going out toward the bay . The air smelled clean and cottony . In the old white Grange Hall with its octagonal tower , twenty - five or thirty people sat around an oblong table arguing about cement , zinc , tin , copper , platinum , steel , gravel , limestone , and things she could not identify . Many of them seemed to be women , although she often found when she heard a voice that she had guessed wrong . They ranged from sixteen to extreme old age . Few of them looked entirely white , although their being tanned by the sun made that harder to judge than it might have been in the middle of the winter . They spoke in ordinary voices and did not seem to be speechifying . Behind some seated at the table sat others listening closely and at times putting in their comments and questions . “
66871	66940	66864	66864	person	5078	” Luciente and she pulled up chairs 150 to sit behind Otter , whom she had not at first recognized with her black hair in a single braid and her body in overalls splashed with mud and salt . Otter flashed them a smile before turning back to the display set in the table between every other delegate that showed figures , allotments , graphs they were discussing . “

67008	67043	66996	66996	We	2326	” A map flashed on the displays set in the table . The person speaking , with sideburns and a bristling mustache , somehow drew on the map indicating the section he referred to . "
67055	67067	67052	67052	Luciente	309	" Rep from Goat Hill , Cape Verde flavor village upriver . "
67068	67091	67092	67096	a person with green hair	2339	" Seems to me that cuts into the catchment area for rain water . We have none too much water , people , "
67099	67135	67136	67137	the mustache	2340	" We are only thinking of a matter of fifty , sixty acres of second - growth woods and scrub . Our region imports too much grain , we have all , agreed on that , ”
67140	67177	67178	67178	Otter	395	“ Without water we can grow nothing . Our ancestors destroyed water as if there were an infinite amount of it , sucking it out of the earth and dirtying and poisoning it as it flowed , ”
67182	67198	67178	67178	Otter	395	“ Let us not be cavalier about water . What does the soil bank say ? "
67199	67206	67207	67207	Luciente	309	“ I 'll direct the question . ”
67211	67225	67207	67207	Luciente	309	“ That 's the rep from Cranberry . That person is chair today . ”
67226	67234	67178	67178	Otter	395	“ Who 's that with green hair ? ”
67235	67297	67178	67178	Otter	395	" Earth Advocate - speaks for rights of the total environment . Beside per is the Animal Advocate . Those positions are not chosen strictly by lot , but by dream . Every spring some people dream they are the new Animal Advocate or Earth Advocate . Those who feel this come together and the choice among them falls by lot . ”
67325	67350	67317	67322	the Ned 's 151 Point rep	2343	" The woods in question are fasure catchment . To take these acres from forest would cut our capacity to hold our water table . ”
67351	67371	67372	67374	the Cranberry rep	2344	“ How can we up our grain output if we ca n't pull land from scrubby woods to farming ? ”
67377	67390	67391	67393	the Earth Advocate	2345	“ Then we must up the output of the land we have , ”
67396	67421	67422	67422	Otter	395	“ We 're only starting to find ways of intensively farming , so the soil is built more fertile instead of bled to dust . ”
67437	67496	67422	67422	Otter	395	“ These woods are birch , cherry , aspen , but with white pines growing up . Will be pine forest in ten years . Its history as we have it is : climax forest , cleared for farming , abandoned , scrub to climax again , bulldozed for housing , burned over , now returning to forest . ”
67503	67557	67500	67500	Luciente	309	“ We ' arrive with the needs of each village and try to divide scarce resources justly . Often we must visit the spot . Next level is regional planning . Reps chosen by lot from township level go to the regional to discuss gross decisions . The needs go up and the possibilities "
67588	67605	67575	67575	they	759	” A vote was taken and Goat Hill was turned down . The Marion rep suggested , “
67645	67651	67634	67634	We	2349	” Luciente 's kenner called . "
67655	67664	67665	67665	We	2349	" Connie heard her say , and then , “

67678	67687	67665	67665	We	2349	” a middle - aged man was arguing . “

67850	67857	67858	67858	Somebody	5287	” Luciente looked at her blankly . “
67863	67969	67858	67858	Somebody	5287	" The dipper turned out to be a bus - train object that rode on a cushion of air about a foot off the ground until it stopped , when it settled with a great sigh . It moved along at moderate speed , stopping at every village , and people got on and off with packages and babies and animals and once with a huge swordfish wrapped in leaves . They sat down in a compartment with an old man facing them , wizened up like a sultana , fiddling constantly , with a satisfied air , with the blanket wrapped around his baby . "

68826	69016	69017	69017	Sappho	492	" the kenner said . They walked the river path to the south end of the village , where a big tent had been set up . The rain slowed to a fine drizzle and the wind came fresh down the stream . The river was eddying at the turn of the tide , not quite flowing in or out . On a cot under a low roof of canvas , the old woman Sappho lay . She wore deerskin leggings and tunic , large on her and aged , though beautifully decorated with quillwork in soft colors . Gaunter than ever , her face seemed to draw back from the beak of her Indian nose . Her lips were thinned almost away . The skull stood out through the scant hair , pressing the withered skin of her forehead and cheeks . Sappho 's black eyes were dull and Connie was not sure she could see , but still she turned her head from side to side to follow conversations , the heavy head turning wearily on the tiny neck like a seed head on a dried stalk .

70006	70021	70000	70000	I	0	” Jackrabbit and White Oak carried her cot between them . White Oak asked , “
70032	70043	70022	70022	Sappho	492	” Sappho did not answer directly but twisted her head . “
70054	70070	70048	70048	I	0	” They carried her cot as near as they dared , but still she complained . “

70097	70144	70093	70093	Person	5078	” Jackrabbit picked her up gently , with grave care , and then slowly knelt , still holding her , while White Oak brought Sappho 's hand down to the water and held it in the current . The fingers unclenched , the hand slowly opened . “
70147	70151	70093	70093	Person	5078	” she muttered . “

70207	70276	70277	70277	Aspen	526	" Aspen returned with her hair cut off . She knelt beside the cot , where Jackrabbit had stretched Sappho 's husk of body . Understanding after a moment that Sappho could no longer hear her , she pressed her shorn hair into the old woman 's lax hand . Sappho 's hand clasped about the hair and again her mouth twitched in a faint grimace of smile . "

70438	70599	70600	70600	Bee	378	” Erzulia did not watch to see if she was obeyed but sat on the cot 's edge and took Sappho 's fragile head in her long - fingered black hands . Erzulia 's hair was put up in dozens of narrow braids woven into a beehive on her highdomed head . She dressed in a long folded - over skirt of a blue cloth batiked into a pattern of snakes and flowers , leaving her breasts and lithe powerful shoulders bare . Her large eyes glazed over as she grasped Sappho and sweat started out on her broad forehead . Still , rigid , she sat with Sappho 's head clasped in her fingers . Sweat broke out and trickled past her cheeks and sweat ran over her conical outpointing breasts , sweat rose from her in a heat shimmer as if from the body of a long - distance runner . í Luciente spoke softly to her kenner . “

Then we plant the mulberry tree Sappho wanted . Someone will go to the tree nursery in Marion for one . Then before we 161 go to bed , we visit the brooder and signal the intent to begin a baby . "
72238	72252	72083	72083	Luciente	309	“ Right away ? That 's heartless . One in , one out ! ”
72253	72297	72083	72083	Luciente	309	“ Why heartless ? In a week traditionally , when we are caught up on work and sleep , we discuss into which family the child should be born and who are to be mothers . We begin by meditating on the dead . "
72298	72317	72161	72161	Luciente	309	“ It just seems ... cheap somehow . No funeral , no undertaker . Just shovel them in . "
72318	72466	72083	72083	Luciente	309	" Connie , your old way appears barbaric to us , trying to keep the rotting body . To pretend we are not made of elements ancient as the earth , that we do not owe those elements back to the web of all living ... For us a good death is one come in the fullness of age , without much pain and in clear mind . A full life is a used life ! Person should be tired . ... You should sit in on the wake with us ! You 'll see . It feels beautiful , it feels good . You 'll see what beauty Jackrabbit makes - person and Bolivar spectacle together . Bolivar is a ritual maker . I myself will perform tonight with my drums — which we should scamp over and get after we set up at the meetinghouse . ”

72876	72945	72870	72870	Skip	429	" They do n't act like they 're fixing to turn us loose . I got a funny letter from my father , saying they 're real proud I 've been picked to be in a pilot project for special attention , and they hope I 'll cooperate and get well . That we 're lucky to have such a famous doctor , written up in Time magazine . "

72987	73009	73010	73010	She	2526	“ Beats me . What bothers me is that the hospital 's been after them to sign a permission for something . "

They stuck electrodes on my prick and showed me dirty pictures , and when I got a hard - on about men , they shocked me . Whatever they 're into here , it ca n't be that painful , right ? "

76091	76210	76038	76038	She	309	" It 's my flimsy for the eveningJackrabbit designed it . ... A flimsy is a once - garment for festivals . Made out of algae , natural dyes . We throw them in the compost afterward . Not like costumes . Costumes circulate - like the robe Bee wore for naming ? Costumes you sign out of the library for once or for a month , then they go back for someone else . But flimsies are fancies for once only . Part of the pleasure of festivals is designing flimsies - outrageous , silly , ones that disguise you , ones in which you will be absolutely gorgeous and desired by every body in the township ! "
76211	76220	76221	76221	Luciente	309	" That must be what yours is for . "

76239	76250	76038	76038	She	309	" What about me ? Can you dress me up ? "
76251	76261	76262	76262	Luciente	309	" I do n't have a flimsy for you . ”
76272	76315	76267	76267	she	309	“ All is running good . You put on Red Star 's flimsy . Red Star ordered it but that person had an accident picking cherries and is healing at Cranberry . We 'll get per flimsy from the presser for you . ”
76475	76484	76470	76470	Luciente	309	“ Produce the flimsy ordered by Red Star . "
76513	76520	76505	76505	Luciente	309	“ Here ! Put it on . "

76633	76640	76610	76610	Luciente	309	" It is n't ... transparent ? ”

In the tall trees outside the children 's house many swings had been put up , conventional , one - person swings , trapezes , two- and three - person swings like cages , round swings , swings people lay in . From all the swings and trapezes , children and middle - aged people and an old woman with long white hair were hurtling through the air , calling to each other like a forestful of monkeys . “
77628	77655	77626	77626	Tecumseh	543	” Luciente pointed to a girl hanging by her bare feet on a trapeze , flipping over and over as if her body had no bones . “

77847	77932	77933	77933	You	0	" In the meadow near the floater pad people were playing games that involved contact or a lot of running around or a lot of acting up and yelling . Some were games with things , like soft collapsible swords , pillows that spilled light bubbles when they broke . People were gliding on big wings off the hill by the river , and every so often someone fell in , settling into the water and then swimming to shore as the wings dissolved . “

78031	78060	78082	78082	Jackrabbit	377	” Luciente stopped in front of a glass wall that mirrored them to admire her dress , turning to and fro like a child in a new suit . “
78086	78173	78084	78084	Bolivar	476	” About ten people were playing with long luminous cords , which they fixed somehow at intervals and wove in and out so that a great dully glowing web was created in which people got caught . A box would be built around them before they were aware or could dash out , and then they were apparently a prisoner until embraced and let out when everybody was so ' trapped but one . Jackrabbit was hopping among the strands , leaving a nimble zigzag wake . “

78290	78291	78292	78292	We	2675	” "
78360	78593	78598	78600	So many people	2692	” Bolivar was about to be enclosed in a box . Quickly Jackrabbit leaped forward and was sealed in with him . The others laughed and called out . Jackrabbit and Bolivar embraced in the fictitious confines of the cell , the walls of luminous rope . Connie could feel that Luciente was not pleased . Jealousy like a damp wind , she could feel it . She was sad for Luciente . So they did feel jealousy here . Both young men were dressed alike , ' naked except for knee - length cloaks thrown back . Each had painted on his chest an elaborate flower , Jackrabbit 's a lush peony , Bolivar 's a trumpeting pale lily . Luciente forgot what she had been saying , forgot her bouncy explanations , and her eyes brooded on them twinned in the web , their slender bodies embracing naked under the rippled backs of the cloaks . Bolivar had been Jackrabbit 's lover long before Luciente ; Bolivar was older than Jackrabbit but much younger than Luciente , who stood fingering the chiffon of her dress , clumsy before their straight , supple , lithe alikeness , feeling cast out from the luminous web of their play . She took Luciente 's arm , as Luciente had so often seized hers , and pulled her firmly downhill in the other direction . "
78610	78636	78598	78600	So many people	2692	” Luciente peered into her face , and her black eyes said she understood Connie 's kindness . Gently Luciente brushed her lips against hers . “
78684	78717	78677	78677	Whoever	2697	" Feeling she had intruded on Luciente 's privacy , which she could hardly avoid when they were linked , she wanted to give her friend a piece of her own life . “

79196	79202	79193	79193	you	2714	” She tried to laugh . "
79209	79210	79193	79193	you	2714	" “

79294	79326	79327	79327	Beethoven	548	” Four older people were playing violins and such together under a gathering of those cool floating lights . Others sprawled on the ground listening . Music older than she was . "
79329	79333	79327	79327	Beethoven	548	” Luciente offered . “

79447	79763	79445	79445	Connie	554	” Beyond the shimmer pool cast by the floating lights , real fireflies slow - blinked their lures on the soft air . At a giant maple a child stood with eyes closed , counting by fives to one hundred : hide - and - seek , a game ancient in her own childhood . Game she had loved as a child in hot dusty Texas streets . Rushing to hide , perhaps alone , perhaps with her best friend Lupe , whose two fat braids always hung before her dark , heart - shaped face . Waiting to be found . Suspense plucked at her with a quasi - sexual thrill as she waited , or as they waited together , giggling and clutched . The worst was not to be found , to go on waiting . The apparent purpose of the game ( to hide so cleverly that no one would find you ) giving way to the real purpose : to sneak in free . Perhaps , perhaps even better if Neftali , around whose sharp bronze face she had cast a secret ring of fire , was to find her . Yes , hide - and - seek wove into its ritual from generation to generation something of the hidden inner life of children . I 'm going to run away from home and you wo n't see me anymore ! But come and search for me . The fear they would not care , would not come after . To be hidden away and then found and brought joyfully out to the others . Yet afraid she lay hidden , her heart beating absurdly in the dust under the pickup truck . Who would come ? What would they do ? The child turned from the tree and stood blinking into 178 the darkness , hesitating on one foot . "
79768	79772	79776	79776	Dawn	400	” Connie cried . “
79778	79786	79776	79776	Dawn	400	” Luciente spoke softly in the shadows . "
79791	79802	79776	79776	Dawn	400	” The flimsy had a pelt and a furry tail . “
79808	79809	79776	79776	Dawn	400	” "
79838	79889	79832	79832	Dawn	400	” Dawn darted away into the bushes and a moment later they heard a squeal of discovery . Dawn came racing after a boy who streaked ahead of her toward the tree - safe . Just short of the tree , she launched a flying tackle and brought him down . “
79893	79894	79891	79891	you	2732	" "
79900	79901	79895	79895	She	2727	" “
79928	79996	79919	79919	You	2732	” Luciente 's excitement returned and she dragged Connie along a little too fast toward a game consisting of a large board with people on it instead of pieces . The game seemed quarrelsome and noisy , and debate raged over the players , whose faces were hidden by masks . They had just come to one edge of the painted board when Luciente 's kenner said , “
80023	80024	80027	80027	Jackrabbit	377	” "
80043	80044	80036	80036	They	2734	” “
80052	80053	80045	80045	Bolivar	476	" “
80103	80114	80045	80045	Bolivar	476	” Luciente spoke with a stilted justice , carefully fair . “
80129	80168	80122	80123	mostly person	2739	” Arm in arm they strolled toward the meetinghouse , a building long and low like a loaf of bread . Inside it was larger than she would have thought , for it was built into the hill . “
80200	81150	81155	81156	the dead	2742	" The rounded ceiling reminded her of the planetarium , the time she had taken Angie for the Easter show . Angie had been frightened of the dark and the stars that seemed 179 to rush toward them and , crawling into her lap to bury her head , refused to look . Gradually Connie had aroused her curiosity and managed to get her to peep at the sparkling night sky of the ceiling . This ceiling too became a night sky with more purple in its black than the night they had just abandoned , with a pale moth - green moon rising in the south over one of the entrances . Slowly as people came wandering in to their seats , a different color moon rose majestically over each of the doors : white to the north , yellow to the east , red to the west and green to the south . As the moons reached the zenith , the four of them began a stately dance to music welling up . Their shapes began to shift from round to oblong to crescent to wing - shaped like birds , images of dignified flight ; now slow hopping courtship of the whooping cranes , extending their broad wings . As the room filled and the doors shut , the cranes came down from the ceiling and became flesh - although she had learned that these vivid three - dimensional images were a mere trick of projectors and lights . A voice like a bird , a reedy voice , talked over the music about whooping cranes and faded into the music . The image broadened . One enormous crane filled it and then his head spread into clouds and his feet turned to water ; little black and white dots came bobbing on the waves toward them , the Labrador duck . Last one shot in 1875 off Long Island . The great vulture , the California condor glided on twelve - foot wingspan . The bald eagle screamed and carried fish home to stuff into the beaks of its huge fledglings , clumsy in the twiggy nest at the top of a dead pine . The grizzly stood at bay . The humpbacked whale rolled and dived and roamed the lightless depths , singing its epics improvised on the age - old patterns of its vast oral culture -was fired on by a factory ship and its warm flesh carved up on the spot for dog food . The last brown - skinned in- - habitant of Tasmania was hunted down and shot on a rocky ledge . Her body smashed on the stark rocks , last of a unique and delicate , small - bodied branch of the human family . Passenger pigeons darkened the sky with their fluttering passage , settled into trees that shone with them like soft blue and gray fruit , their cooing , the feathery warmth of their rosy and buff breasts filling the air . Alarmed , they startled into flight ; the whistling of their thousands of wings beat the air to a wind that rustled the trees . They 180 were shot , they were clubbed , they were taken by live decoy nailed through the feet to a perch , they were lumbered out of their homes , they were slaughtered and fed to livestock . Finally they were gone , the last female dying in a Cincinnati zoo . Ishi , last of the Yaqui of California , came out of the woods where he had lived alone , last of his hunted people , to a world where no soul spoke his language , and died in the Museum of Natural History . Archaic stone lions crouching in a row on wind - swept Delos , lions marching across the tiled walls of Babylon , gave way to the last of the Asian lions , sick , starving under the drought - parched tree in India . The lion 's body became the western prairies where General Sherman led an extermination campaign against Indians and buffalo together . Heaps of corpses rotted under the alkali sun . The wheat grew up through the bodies and the wind blew the land away in dust - storms that darkened the sky . Briefly they became bones flying and then the sky was empty as a skull . The bones lay in the dust . Slowly they put out roots that sank deep in ravaged earth . Slowly the bones burgeoned into sprouting wands . The wands grew to a tree . The oak thrust its taproot deep and outstretched its massive boughs . The tree became a human couple embracing , man and woman . They clutched , they embraced , they wrestled , they strangled each other . Finally they passed into and through each other . Two androgynes stood : one lithe with black skin and blue eyes and red hair , who bent down to touch with her / his hands the earth ; the other , stocky , with light brown skin and black hair and brown eyes , spread his / her arms wide to the trees and sky and a hawk perched on the wrist . A green and brown web flowed out from them and into them . They stood on the shoulder of a huge ant . Grapevines grew from their finger ends . Bees swarmed through the heads . The animal images felt real : they did not appear animations but living beings . The last image was water flowing , which became a crane flying . “
81226	81351	81352	81352	Dawn	400	” The crane flew to the ceiling and slowly split into four moons that set in the four directions . The room lightened . She saw Dawn 's upturned face two rows away , watching the eastern moon go down . In their real future , she had been dead a hundred years or more ; she was the dead who lived in them . Ancestor . Feeling remote from the moment , she fixed her eyes on Dawn 's wondering face . A terrible desire to hold that child 's body tantalized her flesh with the electrical itch of wanting . To touch her gently . Just once . Luciente knew or read her gaze . When the room was light she called , “
81359	81376	81352	81352	Dawn	400	” Dawn glanced around , saw them and climbed nimbly over the rows that were emptying . “
81387	81388	81381	81385	the person from the past	5140	” "
81394	81409	81392	81392	Connie	554	” Luciente said , kissing the small ear that showed through the tumbled hair . “
81415	81455	81411	81411	I	0	” Her voice shook . Dawn looked at her with a limpid sandy brown gaze , questioning . Hesitating . The tremor in her voice . Wanting too much . Scary to a kid . But Dawn finally said , “
81458	81515	81411	81411	I	0	” Quickly she kissed Dawn 's cheek , cupping her small shoulders gently in her hands . Twice the size Angelina had been that last time , but small still . Small - boned . Dawn skipped away then , looking back in open curiosity . Then off at the heels of two other running children . "
81521	81527	81411	81411	I	0	” she said after her . “
81540	81541	81543	81543	her	400	” "
81545	81553	81543	81543	her	400	” They strolled toward the western entrance . “
81577	81578	81569	81569	We	2751	” “
81586	81587	81582	81582	you	0	” “
81610	81617	81619	81619	you	0	" She thought of the asylum . “
81624	81748	81749	81750	The children	4890	” 182 Tose . The Thythms Outside in the soft night music ticked the air . In the square outside the meetinghouse six musicians were playing . People were beginning to dance alone , in couples , in small and large circles . Bee and Erzulia were leaning together arm in arm on the far side , talking with their heads bent close . The music was subtle over a strong beat and a counterbeat : rhythm crossing rhythm but entering the feet , the legs , the hips , the ass , the shoulders . Dawn was dancing with the two children she had chased outside , turning round and round , pulling hard on each other 's taut link of arms . “
81764	81765	81766	81766	They	4890	" “
81811	81812	81805	81805	someone	4649	” "

81853	81966	81970	81970	Angie	324	" . A flash of dog food supper . She worried , never being able to afford to serve meat after Claud was imprisoned . The food prices higher each week . She wanted to commit murder in the supermarket and she could not afford a shoplifting charge , being on suspended sentence . The only meat she could buy was in dog food cans . Should have fed Angie from a bowl on the floor . Who knew what they put in those cans ? Man 's best friend was a big police dog , not a little brown child like Angie . Dogs to defend against poor people like her . “
81979	81989	81974	81974	It	2764	” She had added chili powder , herbs . ; "
81992	82002	81974	81974	It	2764	" Angie pointed to the picture of the dog . “
82012	82014	81974	81974	It	2764	” . "
82030	82061	82024	82025	Bugs Bunny	560	" It turned out Angie feared it was a dog they were eating . She did not want to eat a puppy dog , she explained . Ay de mi ! "
82077	82118	82069	82069	I	0	" But would n't she , if she found one for sale cheap ? She had to feed Angie anything she could find to fill their bellies . What choice had she ? Luciente was holding her by the shoulders . "
82132	82148	82149	82149	I	0	" Tugging her out onto the square . Feed Angie se cans ? child like 183 “

82170	82659	82149	82149	I	0	" She let her eyes half close and her body began to sense the music . Still , it alarmed her , how when she moved her hips the flimsy with all its little bubbles took off and flew away from her body , naked underneath . But nobody was wearing much in the way of clothes . She had not danced since . . . the first time in the bughouse , a sad Christmas party , parody of cheer in old - fashioned polite ballroom dancing , waltzing and fox - trotting and an occasional meek rumba round and round under the watchful eyes of staff and the hungry gazes of the majority not dancing . Luciente was a better partner than any she had enjoyed that evening of excuse me 's and wistfulness and an occasional fumbled clutch . Ah , nothing was so sad as looking around at all the black and Latin patients and watching each other trying to boogaloo so zonked with Thorazine they could bardly do the zombie shuffle . She opened her eyes as the band went into a faster number and saw Bolivar and Jackrabbit dancing . Jackrabbit moved wild and loose and explosive . Bolivar was a little too controlled . He did what he did well , but he was not inventive . He moved with a measured elegance . But Jackrabbit exploded around him . Luciente was dancing to / for Jackrabbit , without ever looking at him . She was performing and Jackrabbit was aware of her too , and so , with resentment , was Bolivar . She encouraged Luciente , she egged her on . Bee stood now with White Oak , chatting and watching . Erzulia was dancing alone , gone into an absorbed passionate trance state where nothing lived but her and the music centered around the throbbing drums . Someone else watched too , a tall woman standing with two others on the steps that led to the meetinghouse . Her hair was in a white turban and one breast was bare , as were her feet . Around her neck a crescent moon was hung , against the white of her dress . She left the women on the steps nd stalaed among the dancers toward them , approaching Luciente from behind . Bee moved onto the square and began to dance beside them . He smiled at Connie with an amusement she did not understand . The tall woman paused behind Luciente , her hazel eyes crinkled with mischief . Unwinding her turban so that her auburn hair fell out loose onto her shoulders , she swung 184 the long white scarf around and then cast it over Luciente , catching her by the waist and pulling her backward . Off balance , Luciente stumbled back against her and remained pinned there , her face silly with surprise . “

82707	82709	82710	82710	Diana	386	” . “
82722	82735	82710	82710	Diana	386	" She tried to turn her head but Diana had her pinned . “

82759	82770	82750	82750	Diana	386	” Diana said flamboyantly , laughing deep in her chest . “
82777	82787	82775	82775	me	0	" she crooned , sighting down her long nose . “
82801	82802	82803	82803	Diana	386	" “
82805	82826	82803	82803	Diana	386	” Luciente twisted around in the loop of the scarf to put her hands on the taller woman 's shoulders . "
82839	82840	82827	82827	You	386	” "
82847	82853	82827	82827	You	386	” Diana released the scarf . “
82873	82883	82884	82884	You	386	” . Luciente gave a short joyful ringing laugh . “
82915	82916	82894	82894	you	386	” “
82942	82950	82935	82935	I	0	" . Bee said in her ear , “
82960	83009	83010	83010	I	0	” Luciente turned toward them , her face begging their pardon , blushing like a fifteen - year - old ; then she gave her hand to Diana and they went off quickly among the dancers and in to the dark . Connie looked after them , perplexed . “
83018	83025	83010	83010	I	0	" Bee said at her side . “
83053	83113	83114	83114	I	0	" With that easy comfort , he took her arm and ambled her off the square . His big hand felt warm and heavy on her : an affectionate acceptance of her like Luciente 's but not like Luciente 's . Because her arm swelled , grew enormous and hot with blood , with his touch on her . 185 "
83120	83125	83114	83114	I	0	” she said haltingly . "
83134	83135	83128	83128	Luciente	309	" “
83143	83144	83141	83141	someone	4649	" “
83149	83319	83141	83141	someone	4649	" Amused and accepting at once . Past the range of the music - loud enough in the square but damped off by baffles beyond it — the night softened to small noises . Someone was singing to a mandolin . People went linked arm in arm , entwining shoulders and waists , to little huts where lights had begun to blink on and off again . Otter , her long hair released from pigtails and hanging straight and black as a flood , of satin to her waist , stood under one of the floating lights staring at a youth who stood staring at her . Otter was touching the other 's face with her fingertips and then she laughed , breathlessly , as if she could hardly breathe . An old person , drunk , with gnarled face bent back and mouth open to the stars that could be seen now and then through the floating lights , sang with thin voice in a minor key : . “
83369	83584	83362	83362	its	2776	” In the dark another heard and began pushing the song through the bell of a trumpet . The brassy honey and vinegar seeped through her . Her hand clasped Bee 's hand harder . He squeezed her hand back and then dropped it , and she felt ashamed until his arm came around her , pulling her closer to him as they strolled still more slowly , her hip bumping his thigh . She could not speak , her flesh heavy and sweet on her bones . She felt swollen equally with old tears and present wanting , the memory of Claud and the presence of Bee . Who was not Claud . But who made her remember . Whose big hand on her waist , the thumb just touching her breast through the flimsy that parted for his thumb hot and fat , asking her and getting 186 an answer as her knees half buckled and her breath sucked in and swayed in instinct faster than decision against him . Thumb messenger of the member she could feel as she pressed against him for his kiss . As his lips moved onto hers in a patient , long , sensual kiss , a voice was singing in a low throaty joyous voice : "
83686	83687	83690	83690	anybody	4581	” “
83699	83711	83690	83690	anybody	4581	" she asked against his chest , drawing a deep breath . “
83726	83730	83716	83716	people	759	” he said . “
83741	83748	83731	83732	This flimsy	2790	" He gestured into the dark . "
83759	83760	83755	83755	you	2777	” "
83766	83844	83755	83755	you	2777	” She laughed . She was startled then to hear that old happy laugh from her chest , that sensual laugh Claud had loved to feel with his hands against her . In the last years she had laughed little and never like that , They stumbled together along a path and up two steps to his door that opened with a tug . Slam of the screen door behind them . He groped at the wall . “
83851	83852	83845	83845	I	0	” “
83862	83901	83903	83903	you	2777	” She did not want to see his space , the strangeness of another time . She wanted to be in the simple space of bed , the space of body against body , constant in any time . “
83914	83973	83906	83906	I	0	" She felt frightened when he said that , as if he could read her mind , her need , her memories . How much did 187 Luciente absorb and know of her ? Yet she felt his kindness radiating toward her and she relaxed and accepted it as she accepted the breeze flowing through the open window . “
83980	83986	83906	83906	I	0	” Bird in the night . "
83989	84479	83906	83906	I	0	" His arm came around her , he was leading her to a low firm bed covered with softness , silky and clinging but thick , as if there could be satin pile . Kneeling , he drew her down and she half fell onto the invisible bed . As he helped her free of the flimsy and nestled down beside her he was naked himself , vastness of his body all about . The substantial velvet shock of skin on skin . Her head fell in . She grasped his back in handfuls . He slowly began to build her body out of the dark , painting her touch by touch so that each windowpane of skin glowed from inside . Once more night gave her a big , generous mouth on her arched throat , her breasts burning like bonfires , her belly rolling under his hands . The head was different , smooth as warm rock . Flesh where no flesh had been . Skin smooth against her thighs as his head rested there , lips and tongue into her there where only Claud had done that before , so that the pleasure came down wet and she melted into him even before he took his mouth away and moved up on her and entered her . So full she felt . The salty sticky taste of herself on his mouth . Never again had she imagined she would feel that weight , the other , heavy body everyplace upon her , the tongues joined and moving as their sex moved together . So good , so good , every last finger spread on his big firm high buttocks , every finger alive to the tip and sunk in his sleek flesh . She felt huge and swollen with pleasure , so sensitive to each slide of his shaft and head as he rode into her , she felt as if she too were sunk into him . Once again to move joined and whole , full with him , open and throbbing , once again to feel the hot flooding rush of his coming , once again to tighten around him , still big enough , and feel him begin to move for her , moving up into her to increase contact , once again to feel her pleasure deepening and spreading like a chord struck in all octaves at once , sustained , played , and then held and held till it slowly faded into its overtones . Her hands loosened and fell from him . He slowed in her , waited , ceased . Weight collected on her . They worked 188 loose , eased into separation side by side . When she opened her eyes , she could dimly see objects , shape of table , chair with something slung over it . Trees rippled their leaves with a wet sound outside . “
84498	84499	84488	84488	They	2792	" “
84517	84518	84510	84510	We	2793	" "
84522	84530	84510	84510	We	2793	" She sat up on an elbow . "
84542	84543	84544	84544	Luciente	309	” “
84548	84549	84544	84544	Luciente	309	” “
84554	84563	84544	84544	Luciente	309	" His knuckles gently trailed along her cheek . "
84574	84586	84544	84544	Luciente	309	” She sat up straight and clutched the cover around herself . “
84594	84595	84544	84544	Luciente	309	” “

84709	84714	84705	84705	You	0	" His voice rumbled . “
84745	84752	84733	84733	me	0	" She touched his chest lightly . “
84773	85196	84770	84770	You	0	" In the morning she felt groggy and hung over when the Muzak came over the PA system with the male voice saying that it was time for patients to get up . As she stood in line for the showers , sensual memories played over her thighs , her belly . His hands upon her , his mouth , the weight and heft of him , the sleekness of his beautiful skin . Joy cut through the scum of the morning . She felt sleepy , fatigue whined in her skull , but she did not mind . The day for once beckoned . The day had a shape full of hope , the afternoon like a hill with a fine view that she would slowly climb . It was not impatience she felt as she stood in line for 189 NET the usual breakfast slop , wan oatmeal and the rationed cup of bitter coffee more precious than dope . All the day stretched toward Dolly 's arrival , but to yearn was to be full . She kept the memory of the evening too rich yet to squander , a candy she could suck and suck , during the week and not use up . Could she tell Dolly about Bee ? She could refer to him as if he were a patient she was flirting with . What would Dolly 's new man be like ? She must get on a better footing with him than she had with Geraldo . Yet from the letter he was her pimp . How could she like a pimp ? Parasites of women 's sweat . Body lice . Why was Dolly still on the streets ? Debts , money , her daughter Nita to feed . No reproaches ! May love flow : Luciente waved her calloused hand . Connie combed and combed her wiry hair . That ugly white parting . How drab she looked , how ashen her skin seemed . Dolly , so young and plump and juicy , how could she help wanting to turn away when she saw her aunt ? Madwoman with skunk hair wrapped in a faded dress sizes too big , shuffling to meet them like something that crawled out of the wall . Mrs. Yoshiko , the weekend attendant , brought her a bright red lipstick , Mrs. Yoshiko , exactly her height , laughed and stuck some pins in her hair so that it looked different and a little better . "
85200	85294	84770	84770	You	0	” She spoke little English but she smiled sometimes and sometimes she looked at them when they spoke . After lunch she sat at a card table playing gin rummy with Mrs. Stein and losing lots of little white chips torn out of a magazine they used for money . She waited . One o'clock ! Visiting hours began . No one for her . Of course she could hardly expect Dolly to arrive at one ! It took two hours to get here from New York . Longer in , heavy traffic . "
85749	85756	85757	85757	Sybil	418	“ That 's Alice Blue Bottom , "
85760	85769	85757	85757	Sybil	418	“ Look what they 've done to her ! ”
85770	85781	85838	85845	a machine up on legs beside the bed	2827	“ What is it ? Did she have an accident ? ”
85782	85795	85796	85796	Connie	554	" I do n't think so . Does n't that look bizarre ? "
85802	85810	85796	85796	Connie	554	“ Are you sure it 's her ? ”
85812	85829	85838	85845	a machine up on legs beside the bed	2827	" I read the name on the chart at the foot of her bed , Consuelo . "
85830	85835	85836	85836	She	554	" Is she unconscious ? ”
85847	85917	85836	85836	She	554	" No . She made a face at me when I came in , which is why I read the name on her chart . I was embarrassed not to recognize her , so I said , Hello , and she said , Look what they have done to me ! She did not put it exactly that way , but that was the gist of her earthy expressions . "
85918	85926	85838	85845	a machine up on legs beside the bed	2827	“ What did she say they did ? "
85927	85939	85838	85845	a machine up on legs beside the bed	2827	“ Valente hustled me past before I could ask any questions . "
85940	85956	85957	85957	Connie	554	" It looks like they busted her head . Maybe she tried to get away . "
85965	85995	85996	85996	Skip	429	" Is Valente so crude she 'd leave visible damage ? A sock with a soap in it , that 's what the attendant used to use on me . ”
86002	86007	85996	85996	Skip	429	" Hsssst ! Connie ! "
86008	86033	86034	86034	she	2828	" Skip , I ca n't pay you back yet . My niece did n't come Sunday . But she 's coming next weekend , ”
86038	86039	86034	86034	she	2828	" "
86080	86081	86075	86075	they	2829	” "
86091	86097	86098	86098	They	2829	” Skip shook his head . “
86112	86113	86105	86105	They	2829	” "
86118	86131	86115	86115	you	0	” Maybe Skip was crazy . Nevertheless she felt weak with fear . “
86143	86144	86145	86145	She	508	” "
86149	86154	86145	86145	She	508	" Sybil said haughtily . “
86167	86168	86169	86169	You	2831	” “
86180	86194	86169	86169	You	2831	" With brokenwinged dignity , Skip shambled back to the men 's side . “
86200	86954	86169	86169	You	2831	" It sounded like a crazy fantasy - like Sybil 's microwave ovens that burned out magic . Glenda insisted that electroshock was a dentist 's drin . Maybe they had given Alice a shot in the head , a new drug injected directly in the brain ? That too was crazy . Those new drugs they tried out made your kidneys turn to rock or caused your tongue to swell black in your mouth or your skin to crust in patches or your hair to fall in loose handfuls , like stuffing from an old couch . Perhaps a drug injected right in the brain could turn you 193 into a zombie as quick as too much shock . - This ward was peculiar , because it was like a hospital ward . The mental hospital had always seemed like a bad joke ; nothing got healed here . The first time in she had longed for what they called health . She had kept hoping that someone was going to help her . She had remained sure that somewhere in what they called a hospital was someone who cared , someone with answers , someone who would tell her what was wrong with her and mold her a better life . But the pressure was to say please and put on lipstick and sit at a table playing cards , to obey and work for nothing , cleaning the houses of the staff . To look away from graft and abuse . To keep quiet as you watched them beat other patients . To pretend that the rape in the linen room was a patient 's fantasy . But this was a real hospital , even if an ancient one . There were fifteen women on her side of the ward . Her bed was a hospital bed that went up and down , more comfortable than anything she had slept in for years , since she had been the mistress - secretary - errand girl - servanthousekeeper to Professor Silvester . Feeling like an old hand , she smiled at Sybil as they began figuring how they would make do here , the space that might exist , the fringe benefits that could be squeezed . Tuesday morning she was confined to her bed , as if she were sick . The doctors were to come in the morning . Monday afternoon they had been sent through a whole battery of tests — blood , urine , reflexes , all fussed over by Dr. Morgan . Redding had not been there . He taught someplace . He was connected with something called NYNPI . He was an important man . She was beginning to feel that his actual appearance was ominous . Better when he was being busy elsewhere . On others . There were others . Patients in the hospital in the city . Unsatisfactory in some way . Outpatients slipped away . They could not be depended upon . Their families butted in . They , tucked now in beds in their rows , were to be in some way more satisfactory . She dozed in her bed , groggy on drugs . Casually in the early morning ward she cast an invitation to Luciente . She felt shy , embarrassed . Tentatively she opened her mind and sensed Luciente 's response . How easy it had become to slip over to Mattapoisett . She did not return ex- 194 hausted . As if her mind had developed muscles , she could easily draw Luciente , she could leap in and out of Luciente 's time . . Luciente 's family — Bee with his head tilted back beaming at her , the old woman Sojourner on his left , Barbarossa , Otter in long . braids looking Chinese , the slight blond man Morningstar bent over Dawn , Jackrabbit staring at one of the decorated panels with a dreamy frown , Hawk thoughtfully picking her nose , Luxembourg about to say something and visibly remembering she was no longer Hawk 's mother and still on the silence taboo were seated around a table in the fooder , breakfasting on whole grains , nuts , sunflower seeds , blueberries , yogurt . The milk tasted full of flavor , like milk from her grandmother 's . The teacher said raw milk made you sick ; grandmother said it made you strong . Herb tea in large pots steamed . "
86961	86962	86169	86169	You	2831	" “
86979	86983	86169	86169	You	2831	” Luciente yawned . “

87005	87022	86997	86997	you	2832	” Bee shifted as if he might respond , but Barbarossa was ready with an answer . “

87121	87156	87157	87157	People	759	” Everyone looked glum and even Jackrabbit stopped staring at the offending panel . Five people started at once talking about protein and underdevelopment and the creation of hunger , when Dawn piped up , “
87168	87195	87196	87196	I	0	" Other conversation stopped . She preened in the attention , making her face serious . Morningstar 's head bobbed over her like a pale sun . “

87233	87246	87204	87204	I	0	” Otter gave her a skeptical smile , arching her brows . 195 “

87299	87308	87286	87286	Everyone	5231	” Luciente exchanged a wry look with Otter . “
87314	87319	87320	87320	Magdalena	493	” They both smiled . “
87326	87330	87320	87320	Magdalena	493	” Dawn insisted . “
87337	87355	87320	87320	Magdalena	493	” Bee - whose gaze Connie had carefully not met - rumbled from deep in his chest , “
87401	87402	87320	87320	Magdalena	493	" “
87410	87418	87419	87419	I	0	" Dawn stuck out her soft chin . “

87449	87460	87441	87441	Nobody	793	" Hawk said , her straight nose wrinkled in disgust . “

87476	87492	87493	87493	We	2846	” Sojourner had a flattened leathery face and eyes that twinkled with a lively pleasure . “
87513	87519	87509	87511	those who listen	2852	” She winked at Connie . "
87526	87530	87524	87524	us	2846	” Connie asked . “
87536	87537	87531	87534	Many who come here	2853	” “
87542	87548	87531	87534	Many who come here	2853	” Luciente was yawning again . "
87561	87571	87531	87534	Many who come here	2853	” Luciente 's hand made boxes in the air . “
87612	87613	87616	87616	you	2859	" "
87644	87654	87620	87620	You	2859	” A surge of discomfort passed around the table . "
87661	87667	87620	87620	You	2859	” Bee said , frowning . “
87728	87729	87738	87738	you	2859	" “
87743	87832	87738	87738	you	2859	” Her eyes touched Bee and withdrew as if burned , after- 196 image of black on her retina . Suppose there was a price ? Suppose they wanted something from her , something , anything . Vaguely she imagined herself smuggling back a weapon , a bomb disguised as a toothbrush . Why should they have been so nice to her if they did n't want something ? In her lap under the table her hands sought each other , coldly sweating . Barbarossa cleared his throat . “
87879	87920	87987	87987	you	2865	" She did not like to be lectured by him , for he reminded her of other men , authorities in her time , even though she could see that in this setting he had no edge on the others . “
87925	87936	87922	87922	you	2865	" Still she waited for the price , the stinger . “
87942	87952	87922	87922	you	2865	” Luciente smiled , her eyes liquid and sad . “
87964	87965	87966	87966	I	0	” "

88020	88032	88017	88017	you	2865	" Her glance fell on Dawn , pouting in her chair . “
88074	88111	88112	88112	Dawn	400	” That child being wheeled to electroshock , her fine brown hair plastered to her scalp with sweat , her eyes so wide open staring at the ceiling that a ring of white circled her pupils . "
88132	88142	88112	88112	Dawn	400	” Luciente said , getting up to caress her . “
88165	88182	88162	88162	you	2867	” Connie looked across the table at Bee , meeting his gaze for the first time . “
88189	88190	88162	88162	you	2867	” “
88193	88202	88162	88162	you	2867	” His big head nodded in cordial agreement . “
88208	88209	88210	88210	Me	0	” "
88214	88215	88216	88216	You	2867	" "
88248	88267	88238	88238	You	2867	" His voice was warm , almost teasing , yet his eyes told her he was speaking seriously . “
88296	88297	88292	88292	we	2869	” "
88355	88356	88347	88347	You	2867	” “
88364	88373	88347	88347	You	2867	" Sojourner said with a broad yellow grin . "
88378	88382	88347	88347	You	2867	” She grimaced . “
88407	88408	88411	88411	Connie	554	” “
88448	88511	88431	88442	all the people who changed how people bought food , raised children	2876	” Otter was so excited she leaned far forward over the table till one of her fat braids dipped into the yogurt . As she argued Hawk picked Otter 's braid out and wiped it with a cloth napkin without Otter even noticing . Hawk smiled . Her smile still said mother . For a moment her glance rested on Dawn wistfully . “
88533	88534	88431	88442	all the people who changed how people bought food , raised children	2876	" “
88566	88580	88581	88581	You	2880	" Luciente held her hands up , her eyes big and laughing . . "
88589	88602	88581	88581	You	2880	" Connie said warily . Was Luciente sore at her about Bee ? “
88613	88618	88619	88619	Jackrabbit	377	" Otter said teasingly . “
88639	88665	88621	88621	I	0	” Jackrabbit roused and waved in response , traces of paint and something shiny on his arms as if he had not quite cleaned up . "
88672	88676	88621	88621	I	0	” Luxembourg said . “
88687	88688	88678	88678	person	5078	" “
88691	88696	88678	88678	person	5078	” Luciente woke up . “
88712	88713	88702	88702	everyone	5231	" “
88722	88723	88702	88702	everyone	5231	" “
88730	88735	88702	88702	everyone	5231	” Luciente said fimly . "
88751	88752	88744	88744	Luxembourg	464	" “
88760	88768	88755	88755	you	0	” Jackrabbit said , grin- 198 ning . “
88781	88789	88755	88755	you	0	" Luciente rubbed her cheek , embarrassed . “
88809	88810	88804	88804	I	0	” "
88823	88907	88804	88804	I	0	" Otter asked , and everybody laughed , enjoying their power to embarrass Luciente . Dr. Redding had arrived on the ward as she slipped back . Nobody was paying attention to her . I could have stayed longer , she thought regretfully , but things looked interesting . Dr. Redding , Dr. Morgan , Acker , the psychologist , Miss Moynihan , the EEG technician , and even the secretary , Patty , and the attendants were gathered around Alice 's bed . "
88958	88998	88943	88943	I	0	” Dr. Redding said coldly . Dr. Morgan 's ears were red sticking through his pale thin hair . He hunched smaller . Misery rose from him like a stench . It was quiet in the women 's ward . “
89012	89021	89007	89010	Dr. Ever - Ready	427	” Alice grinned under the hill of bandages . “
89045	89060	89031	89031	He	2890	” Alice snapped her teeth . Under the sheet she wriggled her long body . "
89065	89071	89063	89063	Francis	301	” Dr. Redding said genially . "
89131	89132	89133	89133	You	301	” "
89194	89235	89177	89177	You	301	” A tremor of embarrassment bent them all , grass in the wind . Then they drew mutual strength , gathered around Alice 's bed , and silently decided to pretend not to hear her . 199 Acker muttered something about "
89239	89269	89177	89177	You	301	" . They clustered around a machine that was writing with pens eight at a time on paper that had been heaping up on the floor in accordion piles . "
89274	89280	89177	89177	You	301	” Alice said , louder . "
89298	89306	89307	89307	Argent	530	” Redding held out his wrist watch . “
89325	89360	89361	89361	Nurse	6159	” Morgan and Moynihan were exclaming over spikes . All the time the pens kept writing and the paper kept dropping in its neat diarrhea on the floor . Redding came to a decision . “
89395	89427	89370	89371	Mrs. Valente	564	" He sped out , with his staff in pursuit . The nurse began removing the head bandages . Cautiously Connie and Sybil edged nearer and nearer till Connie called out , “
89440	89441	89370	89371	Mrs. Valente	564	” "
89451	89467	89447	89447	they	2900	” Connie stared expectantly as the bald scalp emerged from the swathing . Like Bee . “
89475	89476	89477	89477	They	572	” "
89502	89503	89504	89504	Alice	508	” “
89516	89521	89522	89522	You	508	” Sybil asked cautiously . "
89543	89544	89537	89537	they	572	" “
89552	89558	89547	89547	you	2899	” the nurse said suddenly . “
89574	89575	89568	89568	You	2899	” "
89602	89607	89591	89591	we	2906	” Sybil said loftily . “
89624	89643	89644	89645	The nurse	4699	" the nurse said , hands on her hips . Back at their own beds , Sybil whispered , “
89659	89660	89644	89645	The nurse	4699	" “
89665	89666	89644	89645	The nurse	4699	” "
89679	89854	89644	89645	The nurse	4699	" Sybil whispered . What nonsense it had to be ! They were crazy , they were imagining this . She wished she had stayed in Mattapoisett . · 200 At eleven the staff was back with two more doctors and a video tape crew . One of the newcomers she recognized from the Christmas party of her last commitment as the superintendent of the hopsital . Dr. Samuel Hodges was over six feet tall and in his late fifties , with only a circlet of crisp curly gray hair like a laurel wreath around his ruddy dome . The other man was older , with silky white hair , a radiant tan , a fine gray suit , natty but conservatively tailored . Dr. Redding and Dr. Hodges called him Chip , but Dr. Morgan called him Dr. Argent . Dr. Redding asked him how St. Peter 's Island had been , casually throwing at the super that Dr. Argent 's family owned an island off Georgia . Scoring , point - counting . "
89860	89865	89644	89645	The nurse	4699	” Dr. Argent said . “
89880	89967	89968	89968	We	2912	” He spoke differently than the others ; at first she thought perhaps he was English , and sometimes his voice reminded . her of the Kennedys speaking on TV . He wore his white hair a little long and wherever he stood became the center of the room . Redding talked to him with the soft edge of diffidence mellowing his voice . A teasing edge brought a laugh up to Redding 's throat and kept it waiting there , like a little warning light . “
89981	89988	89968	89968	We	2912	” Redding said to Dr. Hodges . “
90021	90022	89968	89968	We	2912	" “
90030	90036	89968	89968	We	2912	” one of the crew said.- “
90052	90053	89968	89968	We	2912	” “
90062	90075	89968	89968	We	2912	" Alice yanked away from the nurse and flailed in the bed . "
90100	90117	90089	90089	I	0	” Redding said . Dr. Hodges made him a litle bow , indicating he should continue . “
90125	90131	90132	90132	We	2912	” Mrs. Valente said apologetically . “
90155	90212	90146	90146	her	2915	” They looked at Valente blankly . Connie felt embarrassed herself . She had disliked Valente on sight , because of her burliness and her speech impediment . But Valente actually saw them as people ; saw Alice as a woman who should 201 . not be publicly shamed . Valente went on , mumbling badly . "
90218	90219	90220	90220	Patty	432	” "
90222	90233	90220	90220	Patty	432	” Dr. Redding nodded to the ever - hovering secretary . “
90251	90252	90220	90220	Patty	432	" “
90262	90300	90301	90301	Alice	508	” Patty looked dubious . She was a slender woman , always in a mint green or cherry red pants suit , with short blond hair and big round blue - tinted glasses sliding on her nose . “
90326	90355	90356	90356	Charlie	578	” So they were going to do it to all of them . They were going to do it to her - whatever it was . Her too . “
90365	90370	90356	90356	Charlie	578	” Dr. Argent said , “
90390	90391	90410	90410	Roll	579	” “
90396	90403	90410	90410	Roll	579	” Redding chuckled , looking upstaged . "
90413	90414	90410	90410	Roll	579	” "
90443	90508	90436	90436	you	578	" Alice did keep going . She succeeded in heaving herself out of the bed and it took both attendants and the nurse to force her flat again . As the struggle proceeded , the crew started filming , a mike dangling over the bed , while the impassive gum - chewing cameraman edged Patty out of the way to get a good angle . "
90518	90634	90635	90635	We	2926	” Sybil yelled . All the patients were active now , some talking loudly to themselves or the air , Miss Green lying prone with the pillow pushed over her head , Tina Ortiz watching in a knot of fury . The men were crowding the door to stare in . Alvin made a dash down the ward to bang on the outer door with both fists . Fats grabbed him under the armpits and walked him back to his bed . Alvin did not appear again ; probably they snowed him with heavy tranks . Redding , wearing a small mike around his neck like a pendant , lectured steadily on amperage and voltage . “
90668	90784	90635	90635	We	2926	" He sounded like a repairman from the telephone company calling in to report on a job . Alice breathed in snorts , letting go a tirade of curses . One 202 of the crew shut off her mike . The two attendants braced themselves , holding her down . Dr. Argent stood with his hands clasped behind his back and his lips pursed as if he might start whistling a tune , watching the whole scene with bright interested gaze . Occasionally he rocked to and fro on the balls of his feet . Dr. Hodges stood farther back , stealing a glance at his watch . Finally he sent Patty for a chair . “
90861	90882	90818	90818	layman	2929	” Dr. Argent winced , seemed as if he would speak , muttered to himself . Finally he said softly , “
90894	90895	90892	90892	Charlie	578	” “
90908	90916	90917	90917	You	2932	" Redding turned to the camera crew . “
90935	90936	90928	90928	we	2927	” "
90943	90951	90928	90928	we	2927	" Miss Moynihan said to the crew , "
90966	90967	90960	90960	We	2927	" “
90986	90992	90993	90993	Chip	574	" Dr. Hodges said testily . "
91001	91013	90993	90993	Chip	574	” Redding pleaded , and together they moved toward the bedside . “
91027	91028	91019	91019	Alice	508	” "
91043	91044	91031	91031	you	2939	” “
91055	91066	91067	91067	Alice	508	" He signaled , like a conductor to his orchestra . "
91075	91104	91067	91067	Alice	508	” Alice relaxed suddenly . A look of surprise came over her face . She did n't reply . Her mouth remained open , then she shut it . “
91108	91127	91128	91128	Doctor	4599	” Redding said to the attendants . They looked uncomfortable and did not let go . Fats whined , “
91146	91147	91139	91139	She	2938	” "
91154	91162	91139	91139	She	2938	” Redding said with a faint smile . “
91170	91187	91139	91139	She	2938	” Gingerly the two attendants backed away from Alice . She continued to lie still . 203 “
91196	91211	91194	91194	Alice	508	" Alice turned her head from side to side . She began to smile . "
91221	91223	91216	91216	I	0	” . “
91233	91234	91231	91231	Alice	508	” "
91260	91264	91254	91254	You	508	” Redding chuckled . “
91284	91302	91303	91303	I	0	” Exchanging looks of confusion , the attendants took hold of Alice , who giggled and writhed . "
91312	91346	91308	91308	I	0	" Redding barked . A moment later Alice 's face broke into a snarl and she jerked upright and lashed out at Fats . The nurse had to pile on to wrestle her . "
91354	91355	91356	91356	Doctor	4599	” "
91362	91371	91358	91358	We	2947	” But Alice collapsed and began to giggle . "
91477	91488	91494	91494	Doc	580	" The cameraman said , as they began packing up , “
91508	91509	91497	91497	you	580	” “
91521	91535	91497	91497	you	580	” As the video tape crew left , Redding turned to his audience . “
91551	91565	91544	91544	you	580	” Dr. Argent gave him a wry smile , hand on his shoulder . "
91605	91606	91600	91600	he	583	” "
91633	91634	91635	91635	I	0	” “
91660	91670	91658	91658	Charlie	578	” Dr. Hodges cleared his throat , rising stiffly . “
91705	91706	91707	91707	Sam	573	” "
91930	91950	91916	91917	Dr. Argent	530	“ Is n't he persuasive , Sam ? That 's how I found myself knee deep in this gadgetry . ”
91951	91954	91955	91955	Redding	426	“ Nonsense , ”
91961	91993	91955	91955	Redding	426	" Now that you 're retiring , you want in to the most exciting project to come down the pike in years . You always wanted to make history , Chip . ”
91994	91997	91998	91999	Dr. Argent	530	“ Hmmm , ”
92020	92032	92015	92015	Connie	554	“ They 're going to put a machine in our heads ? ”
92033	92037	92040	92040	her	418	“ Poor Alice ! "
92043	92061	92040	92040	her	418	" She must be humiliated ! Imagine playing up to that fascist because he presses a button . "
92062	92072	92073	92073	Connie	554	“ I do n't want that done to me ! ”
92086	92103	92081	92081	She	554	“ There must be a way to stop them . If only my niece would come ! ”
92316	92320	92313	92314	somebody else	5953	“ Be guest , ”
92343	92349	92350	92350	Luciente	309	" Connie , my rose , "
92354	92389	92350	92350	Luciente	309	“ I ca n't handle you tonight . But I 'm holding till Parra takes over . Open your mind to per . Parra will send tonight if you 'd like to come through . ”
92390	92397	92350	92350	Luciente	309	" Are you sick , Luciente ? ”
92398	92409	92350	92350	Luciente	309	" No , do n't worry . Let Parra send . "
92606	92627	92628	92628	Parra	586	“ I 'm people 's judge for Mouth - of - Mattapoisett this year , and tonight I 'm refereeing , ”
92632	92638	92628	92628	Parra	586	“ This is a game ? "
92639	92648	92649	92649	Parra	586	" No , we 're having a worming . "
92655	92671	92649	92649	Parra	586	“ Do easercises while I explain . You look as if you could use relaxing . ”
92703	92734	92628	92628	Parra	586	“ Luciente and Bolivar have not been communing . Meshing badly . Sparks and bumps . Tonight we try to comprend that hostility and see if we can defuse it . "
92735	92745	92628	92628	Parra	586	“ Are n't people allowed to dislike each other ? ”
92747	92821	92822	92822	Parra	586	“ Not good when they 're in the same core . Jackrabbit is close to both . Such bumping strains per . They compete for Jackrabbit 's attent . They are picky toward each other 's ways . We have critted them for it before , but matters lift only briefly . When they crit each other , it does not hold up under scrutiny as , honest — but self - serving . ”
92826	92839	92822	92822	Parra	586	“ Suppose after a worming they still ca n't stand each other ? ”
92840	92886	92887	92887	Parra	586	" Jackrabbit may choose to see neither for some time . Both may be sent into temporary wandering . We may impose invisibility . We resort to that after bad quarreling . Or sometimes when people cease to be sweet friends , one feels bitterness . ”
92929	93001	93002	93002	Connie	554	“ We put a mother - in - law taboo on - drawn from old - time practice ? Persons are n't allowed to speak for two months to or about each other . Such a time often releases bumping . Besides , it 's such a nuisance , frequently each longs to be done with it and speak to the other again . It becomes silly . That too helps . ”
93005	93046	93002	93002	Connie	554	“ Do n't you people have nothing to worry about besides personal stuff ? Why should you care if Luciente and Bolivar like each other ? What a big waste of those resources you all like to go on about ! ”
93047	93194	93303	93304	a judge	1509	" First , they need not like each other to behave civilly . Second , we believe many actions fail because of inner tensions . To get revenge against someone an individual thinks wronged per , individuals have offered up nations to conquest . Individuals have devoted whole lives to pursuing vengeance . People have chosen defeat sooner than victory , 207 with credit going to an enemy . The social fabric means a lot to us . In childhood we all learn a story about how an anthropologist asked a Pawnee to define bravery . Person said that White Cloud was the bravest individual person had ever known because when Laughing Bear slandered per , White Cloud had given Laughing Bear a horse . How is that brave ? asked the anthropologist . The Pawnee said , But it was White Cloud 's only horse . "
93205	93218	93198	93198	everyone	5231	“ The community is precious . That 's what you 're saying . "
93219	93223	93224	93224	Parra	586	“ Just so . "
93229	93243	93224	93224	Parra	586	" You 're a judge ? Can you hang a sentence on them ? ”
93244	93291	93292	93292	She	586	" Tonight I 'm referee . Here to make sure the group crits each justly . I can point out injustice . Watch for other tensions that may surface , clouding the issues , weighting the reaction . Someone not from this village must play referee . "
93316	93329	93303	93304	a judge	1509	“ Is that what you mean by a judge ? A referee ? "
93330	93340	93224	93224	Parra	586	" No . We act in cases of injury . "
93341	93347	93224	93224	Parra	586	" Suppose I stole something ? "
93348	93407	93303	93304	a judge	1509	" We do n't have much private property . Likely I 'd give 1 you what you asked . But if you did take something , | everyone would give you presents . We 'd think you were speaking to us of neglect and feelings of poverty . We 'd try to make you feel good — wanted . ”
93408	93424	93224	93224	Parra	586	“ Suppose I hurt someone ? What about rape and murder and beating somebody up ? "
93425	93489	93490	93490	She	2989	" We 're trained in self - defense . We 're trained to respect each other . I 've never actually known of a case of rape , although I 've read about it . It seems ... particularly horrible to us . Disgusting . Like cannibalism . I know it occurs and has occurred in the past , but it seems unbelievable . ”
93553	93576	93577	93577	Her	2989	“ Nobody ever takes a knife to anybody ? No lovers ' quarrels ? No jealousy ? Do n't hand me that . ”
93584	93618	93577	93577	Her	2989	“ Assault , murder we still have . Not as common as they 208 . say it was in your time . But it happens . People still get angry and strike out . ”
93619	93633	93577	93577	Her	2989	“ So what do you do ? Do you put them in jail ? "
93635	93656	93577	93577	Her	2989	“ First off , we ask if person acted intentionally or notif person wants to take responsibility for the act . ”
93657	93677	93577	93577	Her	2989	" Suppose I say , ' No , I did n't know what I was doing , judge ' ? "
93678	93705	93577	93577	Her	2989	“ Then we work on healing . We try to help so that never again will person do a thing person does n't mean to do . "
93706	93732	93577	93577	Her	2989	" Suppose I say I 'm not sick . I punched him in the face because he had it coming , and I 'm glad . "
93733	93777	93778	93778	She	2993	“ Then you work out a sentence . Maybe exile , remote labor . Sheepherding . Life on shipboard . Space service . Sometimes crossers cook good ideas about how to atone . You could put in for an experiment or something dangerous . ”
93781	93806	93778	93778	She	2993	“ You 're telling me that when I smashed Geraldo 's face , I 'd tell you what I should do to ... atone ? ”
93807	93811	93577	93577	Her	2989	“ How not ? ”
93816	93847	93812	93812	Parra	586	“ You , your victim , and your judge work , it out . If you killed , then the family of your victim would choose a mem to negotiate . "
93848	93870	93577	93577	Her	2989	" If I killed a bunch of people , then I 'd just sign on as a sailor or herd sheep ? "
93872	93923	93577	93577	Her	2989	“ You mean a second time ? No . Second time someone uses violence , we give up . We do n't want to watch each other or to imprison each other . We are n't willing to live with people who choose to use violence . We execute them . "
93924	93934	93577	93577	Her	2989	" Suppose I say I did n't do it . ”
93935	93939	93940	93940	Parra	586	“ That happens . ”
93945	93993	93942	93942	her	586	“ By lot someone is picked to investigate . When that investigator thinks the crosser has been found , we have a trial . Our laws are simple and we do n't need lawyers . The jury decides . A sentence is negotiated by all the parties . ”
93994	94003	93577	93577	Her	2989	“ You 're Latin , are n't you ? "
94004	94010	93577	93577	Her	2989	“ Latin ? Ancient language ? ”
94011	94016	93942	93942	her	586	“ Spanish - speaking ? ”
94017	94046	93577	93577	Her	2989	" Sí , from down in Río Grande , Tejas del Sur . Pero hace cinco años que he vivido in el pueblo boricua Lola Rodríguez de Tío . "
94047	94081	93577	93577	Her	2989	“ De veras ? De Tejas ? Yo tambíen . I was born in El Paso . So - pues - en Tejas ahora . . . . Who 's got the power ? ”
94082	94089	94090	94090	Parra	586	“ We 're an autonomous region . "
94096	94109	94090	94090	Parra	586	“ Todos , claro , como aquí , como siempre , no ? ”
94111	94118	93577	93577	Her	2989	“ But you all speak Spanish ? "
94119	94132	93577	93577	Her	2989	“ For our first language , claro que sí , como no ? ”
94133	94146	93577	93577	Her	2989	" Why are you here ? Why did you come up here ? "
94147	94230	93577	93577	Her	2989	“ To study with María de Lola Rodríguez . Es experta sobre ríos . En mi region tenemos todavía problemas terribles con los ríos , que estaban envenedados por completo en tu época . I 've been studying five years . María says I can go back to my pueblo in a year , para ayudarles . Tengo muchas ganas de volver . I miss my people , ai ! , me hacen tanta falta ! And the winters burn my teeth . ”
94231	94247	93577	93577	Her	2989	“ Ojalá pudiera ver Tejas ahora ! How I 'd like to see Texas now ! "
94248	94259	94260	94260	Parra	586	" Por supuesto ! It 'll knock your eyes out ! ”
94267	94347	94260	94260	Parra	586	“ What we 've done with adobe in the last forty years — how it glows . We eat plenty of meat too , not like here , where they think one skinny cow makes a fiesta ! We have a wonderful system of little clinics everyplace . And in my departamento , we 've bred many races of vegetables resistant to ... a la sequía , to drought . Verdad , you can ask Bee or · Luciente . "
94367	94373	94364	94364	she	586	“ Should we begin again ? ”
94396	94441	94392	94392	she	586	" I feel that Bolivar 's work emphasizes the individualistic , places style over the whole yin - and - yang . When Jackrabbit works with Bolivar , I feel a political thinness in Jackrabbit 's work , never there when person works alone . ”
94449	94460	94461	94467	a fat person with a bass voice	2996	" Such a crit is too general to be useful , "
94470	94480	94461	94467	a fat person with a bass voice	2996	“ How can Bolivar respond to such vague slinging ? ”
94481	94540	94392	94392	she	586	“ In their recent holi , the image of struggle was a male and a female embracing and fighting at once , which resolved into an image of two androgynes . Yet the force that destroyed so many races of beings , human and animal , was only in its source sexist . Its manifestation was profitoriented greed . ”
94541	94546	94547	94547	Barbarossa	407	“ Luciente crits justly , ”
94550	94582	94547	94547	Barbarossa	407	“ In truth , I did n't think of it . But it seems to me the holi should have related the greed and waste to the political and economic systems . "
94598	94662	94595	94595	her	2997	“ Every piece of art ca n't contain every- 210 thing everybody would like to say ! I 've seen this mistake for sixty years . Our culture as a whole must speak the whole truth . But every object ca n't ! That 's the slogan mentality at work , as if there were certain holy words that must always be named . ”
94663	94675	94676	94676	Barbarossa	407	“ But do we have to be satisfied with half truths ? ”
94679	94688	94689	94689	Bolivar	476	" Sometimes an image radiates many possible truths , ”
94692	94709	94689	94689	Bolivar	476	“ Luciente appears to fix too narrowly on content and apply our common politics too rigidly . ”
94710	94720	94721	94721	Luciente	309	“ Our common politics gives running room for disagreement , ”
94724	94734	94721	94721	Luciente	309	“ I like to be clear about political distinctions . "
94735	94754	94755	94755	Jackrabbit	377	“ A powerful image says more than can be listed . It can not be wholly explained rationally , ”
94759	94766	94755	94755	Jackrabbit	377	“ What does a melody mean ? ”
94767	94781	94782	94782	Luciente	309	“ Yet a work has gross meaning we can agree or disagree with , ”
94785	94795	94782	94782	Luciente	309	“ Our history is n't a set of axioms . "
94802	94874	94796	94796	Bolivar	476	“ I guess I see the original division of labor , that first dichotomy , as enabling later divvies into haves and have - nots , powerful and powerless , enjoyers and workers , rapists and victims . The patriarchal mind / body , split turned the body to machine and the rest of the universe into booty on which the will could run rampant , using , discarding , destroying . ”
94878	94911	94875	94875	Luciente	309	“ Yet I ca n't see male and female as equally to blame , for one had power and the other was property . Nothing in what you made speaks of that . "
94912	94917	94920	94920	his	377	“ You have us ! ”
94923	94928	94920	94920	his	377	“ That 's SO . "
94929	94936	94937	94937	Bolivar	476	“ What we made was beautiful , ”
94940	94966	94937	94937	Bolivar	476	“ Were n't you moved ? A holi is composed of an hour 's images . You 're not respectful enough of beauty , Luciente . ”
94970	95041	94967	94967	Sojourner	412	“ Luciente leans far in the direction of one value and Bolivar in the other . Yet instead of looking at each other with pleasure and thinking how much richer is the world in which everyone is not like me , each judges the other . How silly . You could enrich each other 's understanding through Jackrabbit , who is drawn both ways — as to everything that moves ! "
95042	95071	95072	95072	Jackrabbit	377	" I do n't think the holies I make with Bolivar are better or worse than I make alone . I think Luciente looks at them more critically , ”
95076	95105	95106	95106	Barbarossa	407	“ We all owe you feedback , and it 's a pity Luciente 's critting waited until now to come out . We fail you as our artist , ”
95109	95122	95106	95106	Barbarossa	407	“ If we do n't crit you , how will you grow ? ”
95129	95151	95123	95125	The fat person	2998	“ What do you fear , Luciente , that you watch carefully when they work together ? What makes you nervous ? ”
95225	95231	95232	95232	Luciente	309	" I 'm not sure , ”
95240	95291	95232	95232	Luciente	309	“ I believe sometimes Bolivar seeks to recreate the earlier time when Jackrabbit and Bolivar were always together , each other 's core . To me that 's sliding back to a time now past , when growth means going forward . They seem to me to bind each other . "
95292	95300	95303	95303	his	377	“ Like what you and Diana did ? ”
95306	95312	95303	95303	his	377	" Maybe I fear that . ”
95314	95366	95303	95303	his	377	“ But Diana and Bolivar have different gifts . The intensity we slip into together lets us keep up our intimacy although weeks pass apart . Our intimacy has always been centered on work . Even at our most intense and coupled , we turn outward and give to the community . ”
95367	95372	95373	95373	Sojourner	412	“ True , Luciente , "
95376	95400	95373	95373	Sojourner	412	“ Your binding with Diana kept you from working well . Never did you work together , yet you fed on each other . ”
95401	95407	95408	95408	Hawk	539	“ Bolivar gets nervous too , ”
95412	95439	95408	95408	Hawk	539	“ Bolivar teases Luciente a lot , and it makes per feel silly . That 's how Bolivar pays Luciente back or punishes per or something . ”
95456	95575	95452	95452	Bolivar	476	“ It 's true , how not ? Bolivar outmaneuvers Luciente . Bolivar 's clever , quick - witted . Luciente 's talkative but not witty . Luciente ca n't strike back quick enough to win verbal battles . Now , Luciente thinks through things politically much more carefully than Bolivar . Everybody in Mouth - of - Mattapoisett knows Luciente was recruited for the reaching - back proj not only for per sending , but because of political soundness . Per- 212 son can rep us clearly and fairly . But Luciente uses that political weight as a weapon against Bolivar . You smite each other with your different gifts . Is n't that perverse , no ? ”
95588	95595	95596	95596	Parra	586	“ Then Bolivar too is afraid , "
95599	95613	95596	95596	Parra	586	“ We go too fast . Let 's ask Bolivar what person fears . "
95614	95680	95681	95681	Jackrabbit	377	" If I 'm Jackrabbit 's past , how frail . Luciente is the present . The past disappears . Health is Luciente , growth is Luciente - according to Luciente ! Yet Jackrabbit and I work well together . What 's backward about that ? We love each other differently at twenty - five and nineteen than we did at nineteen and thirteen , but- "
95686	95726	95681	95681	Jackrabbit	377	“ You 've never stopped loving anybody you loved , you know that . Why ca n't you inknow how it is for me ? You do n't think you 're stale on Bee because it 's years old . ”
95734	95801	95729	95729	her	412	“ Suppose you won this little war ? You have Jackrabbit all to yourself . Luciente goes off . Jackrabbit ca n't travel with you all the time without giving up per workshop . Jackrabbit just put in for defending and mothering . How can person combine mothering with a wandering life like yours ? You 're with us maybe a week out of the month . "
95802	95826	95729	95729	her	412	" I never tried to comp Jackrabbit into traveling with me all the time . Only sometimes we 're warmed to work together . "
95827	95845	95846	95848	The fat person	2998	“ But it 's Jackrabbit 's work more than Luciente keeping per here in Mattapoisett , no ? ”
95851	95854	95846	95848	The fat person	2998	" Fasure . ”
95858	95890	95855	95855	Bolivar	476	“ Jackrabbit is more bound to place . Always when we traveled together , person would get irritable . Would sleep badly , grow a mean temper , and sling me . "
95891	95894	95895	95895	Sojourner	412	“ Luciente , "
95899	95957	95895	95895	Sojourner	412	“ Suppose you won your war against Bolivar and whittled per down in the eyes of Jackrabbit . Will you give up Bee and spend all your free time with Jackrabbit ? Will you give up the reaching - back proj or your work in the genetics base to work with Jackrabbit , the way Bolivar does ? ”
95958	95966	95967	95967	Luciente	309	“ That is n't what I want ! ”
95971	95978	95967	95967	Luciente	309	" Bolivar does n't respect me ! "
95979	95985	95986	95986	Parra	586	" Do you respect Bolivar ? ”
95991	95996	95986	95986	Parra	586	“ Why ... yes . "
95997	96000	95895	95895	Sojourner	412	“ Why ? ”
96001	96008	95895	95895	Sojourner	412	“ Person is a good artist . ”
96011	96089	96090	96090	Luciente	309	“ Luciente and Bolivar , sit down face to face inside the ring . Look at each other . Then let 's be quiet a few minutes . I 'm not sure whether we should continue or just leave you to talk . The source of friction seems to lie in your lack of rapport - no friendship yet constant contact . You must set aside time to speak . To deliver your critting and praising privately . "
96125	96170	96117	96117	Connie	554	“ Something puzzles me . It seems like everybody is careful not to say what seems real obvious to me that Jackrabbit and Bolivar have ... well , they 're both men . It 's homosexual . Like that might bother a woman more . ”
96171	96175	96176	96176	Parra	586	" But why ? "
96187	96238	96176	96176	Parra	586	“ All coupling , all befriending goes on between biological males , biological females , or both . That 's not a useful set of categories . We tend to divvy up people by what they 're good at and bad at , strengths and weaknesses , gifts and failings . ”
96570	96583	96620	96620	she	586	“ I caught you with your pants down , baby ! Gin ! ”
96584	96597	96620	96620	she	586	" Shit ! You got me with a mittful of face cards . "
96743	96746	96734	96734	she	586	“ Listen , "
96757	96794	96734	96734	she	586	" we only got another week or two stuck over here . Then it 's back to K building and we 'll have a foursome for bridge again . I get tired playing gin every night . ”
96795	96826	96734	96734	she	586	" I do n't know why , sugar . You beat me all the time . If we were n't playing penny a point you 'd have cleaned me out ! ”
96853	96886	96842	96842	Acker	431	“ But we want you to give us your permission too . We want to be sure you understand how we 're going to help you . We want your wholehearted cooperation . ”
96900	96913	96887	96887	His	431	“ So you feel less guilty what you 're doing to us ? ”
96929	97039	96924	96924	He	431	" What are we doing ? Giving you a chance to get out of the hospital . Make a better life . End these episodes of destructive violence . That as a long - term goal . As a shortterm goal , we 're going to move all our patients out of this state hospital into a ward in NYNPI - a nice research ward . You do n't know what it 's like to be in a well - equipped mental hospital . No dormitories . You can room with your friend Sybil . Good food . Your family will visit you when you 're right in Manhattan . ”
97040	97052	97170	97170	Dolly	305	“ And a chance to get my brains scrambled like Alice . "
97053	97079	97170	97170	Dolly	305	" In two months Alice will be home , Connie . If you leave us , you think you 'll be home in two months ? ”
97080	97090	96924	96924	He	431	“ Yeah . I was n't doing so bad . ”
97091	97136	97138	97138	She	3032	“ You wo n't go back to G-2 . If you transfer out of here , you 'll go back where we found you — on the violent ward , L-6 . With comments on your record about how uncooperative you proved to be . "
97187	97212	97170	97170	Dolly	305	“ You lost so much weight , Connie ! How wonderful ! It 's like one of those reducing farms rich bitches go to . "
97213	97219	97220	97220	Connie	554	“ Not much like them . ”
97223	97228	97220	97220	Connie	554	“ Is Nita here ? ”
97229	97256	97261	97272	a tall well - built man in ice cream white holding Nita	3035	“ They would n't let us bring her in . She 's outside with Vic . Come ' on to the window and we can wave . ”
97296	97301	97302	97302	Connie	554	“ Nita ! Nita ! ”
97336	97343	97344	97344	she	554	“ Dolly , you look beautiful , ”
97353	97360	97344	97344	she	554	“ You lost some weight too ? "
97394	97450	97387	97387	she	305	“ Oh , carita , it pays more if you look Anglo , you know ? And they like you better skinny , the ones with money . Geraldo , that prick , left me with debts and no money . I have to break my behind hustling till I get clear of my debts . ”
97451	97474	97568	97568	Dolly	305	“ Dolly , take off the shades . I ca n't see your expression . It 's like talking through a wall . ”
97497	97567	97568	97568	Dolly	305	“ Nevertheless , darling , everything is going fine for me and mine , let me tell you . I 've done okay without that big honcho . I work hard but the marks come running and I make better money than ever before , much better than with Geraldo . Listen , Connie — last week I made four hundred ! In one week ! How 's that ? ”
97574	97586	97568	97568	Dolly	305	" Dolly , did you maybe bring me a little something ? "
97587	97674	97675	97675	She	3039	“ How could I forget ? I mean forget to tell you . I did n't forget to bring for you . Now listen - I gave the old bitch at the desk thirty dollars for you in your account . Now , if you hold out your hand casual like , I 'm going to slip you another five for extras . This place do n't look like no luxury hotel , but you can buy yourself a little something to take the edge off . ”
97692	97705	97681	97681	Dolly	305	“ And my clothes ? Did you maybe bring me some clothes ? ”
97706	97778	97779	97779	Dolly	305	“ Daddy , he said you were in the hospital and did n't need street clothes . So I brought you two nightgowns , an old one you had and one of my own special ones , with real handmade black lace so you wo n't be ashamed in the hospital . I wore it when I was having my operation , and it brings me down to look at it ! ”
97790	97862	97779	97779	Dolly	305	“ Also I decided to bring you some dresses anyhow . What do men know what women need ? I see you got a dress on , if you can call it that . So I brought you the turquoise and your green print and the red . You could use some new dresses , Connie . You lost so much weight , I do n't know if these will fit . ”
97863	97886	97779	97779	Dolly	305	" The turquoise , it 's from a long time ago . When I was with ... Claud . It 'll fit . ”
97887	97946	97779	97779	Dolly	305	" If you give me your new size , I can get you a nice dress , the length they 're wearing now . ... Listen to meI gave the old bitch at the desk thirty dollars for you , and if you hold out your hand , I 'm going to slip you another five for extras . "
97947	97954	97955	97955	Dolly	305	“ Dolly , you did that ! ”
97962	97979	97955	97955	Dolly	305	" Come on , do n't you get it ? Stick out your hand natural like . "
98021	98027	98005	98005	She	3040	“ What are you on ? ”
98028	98043	97989	97989	Dolly	305	“ Me ? Like always a little of this , a little of that . "
98044	98055	98005	98005	She	3040	" You 're on more than a little of something . "
98056	98136	98137	98137	She	3041	" I got to stay skinny , carita . The money is with the Anglos and they like you skinny and American - looking . It pays more if you look Anglo , you know . Sometimes I say I 'm of Spanish mother and an Irish father , and that 's why I have the beautiful red hair . Even the hair on my thing , I dyed # red — Connie , you would n't believe it . ”
98140	98145	98137	98137	She	3041	" Is it speed ? "
98146	98205	98206	98206	She	3041	" A little , once in a while , to keep my weight down . Who can stand those assholes ? They drive me crazy . They 're all pigs . But I 'm much better off without that prick Geraldo , you know ? This one , Vic , he was a real ballplayer -- no joke . ”
98210	98281	98206	98206	She	3041	" He played a season with the Cleveland Indians , except he was born in 218 the Bronx like me . He 's okay , Connie , it 's purely business . He 's a good businessman . I 'm not crazy about him , but so much the better , you know ? I was crazy for Geraldo , and what did I get besides a lot of trouble ? ”
98282	98299	98005	98005	She	3040	" Is it Vic 's idea you take that poison ? It 'll burn you out . ”
98300	98338	98005	98005	She	3040	" Listen , Connie , I 'm in terrific shape ! Look at me . I weight one hundred seventeen - you believe it ? And last week , you know what I earned on my behind ? ”
98339	98344	98345	98345	she	3042	" Four hundred dollars , ”
98349	98390	98345	98345	she	3042	" How did you guess ? Not bad , hey ? Nice clothes , pretty things for my baby . Mamá keeps · Nita Tuesday through Saturday and then Sunday I get her and I have her till Tuesday morning . "
98391	98399	98005	98005	She	3040	“ Carmel 's got her all week ? ”
98400	98420	98005	98005	She	3040	“ What other mother do I have ? Sure , Carmel 's got her . It works out better . "
98421	98458	98345	98345	she	3042	“ Dolly , this is not good . You do n't have your baby inside , your daughter you only see weekends like an aunt , and you 're taking poison that burns out your soul . ”
98459	98501	98005	98005	She	3040	“ Do n't be silly , Tía . You forget what the world 's like , shut up here . I 'm on top now . I know what I 'm doing . And last week I made four hundred dollars ! "
98503	98526	98005	98005	She	3040	“ Dolly , please . Get me out of here ! I beg you . Get me released . Talk to them ! ”
98527	98562	98005	98005	She	3040	" Hermana , how can I do that ? Luis signed the papers . I did n't have a thing to do with it . You have to talk to Daddy about getting out . ”
98563	98594	98345	98345	she	3042	“ Please , Dolly , do something . I beg you . Look around this ward . They 're operating on us . They 're sticking needles in our heads ! ”
98595	98598	98599	98599	Dolly	305	“ Yeah ? ”
98604	98668	98599	98599	Dolly	305	“ Daddy says they 're famous doctors from a university . That they 're for real helping you so you wo n't have to go in again . He says you 're going to be in a hospital in Washington Heights . I could get to see you all the time . It 's real hard to get up here , you know ? ”
98669	98683	98345	98345	she	3042	“ Dolly , you think I need an operation ? Look at me . ”
98684	98712	98345	98345	she	3042	" Connie , am I a doctor ? What do I know ? At least it 's clean in here , not so depressing like last time . "
98713	98760	98599	98599	Dolly	305	" I do n't want their help , Dolly . I want to go home ! Ligien - l'll work . Tell Luis I 'll do anything ! I 'll work in his sweatshop nursery . I can get temporary office jobs . Tell Luis that ! "
98762	98870	98871	98871	her	3043	" You should n't go on feeling sorry for yourself , Connie — that 's your problem . We can rise above what we are if we have the will . Look at me ! After Geraldo , that prick , left me flat , with no money and lots of debts , I did n't cry long . I cried , sure , but then I went out and got myself a white pimp . I lost twenty - two pounds , you know ? I took myself in hand and I have n't gained a pound in weeks ! I dyed my hair on my head and”-lowering
98873	98902	98871	98871	her	3043	coquettishly—“even the hair on my thing . I say I 'm of a Spanish mother and an Irish father . Sometimes I say my mother was a contessa . ”
98903	98910	98871	98871	her	3043	“ I think that 's Italian . "
98911	98940	98871	98871	her	3043	“ No , it 's Spanish . Anyhow , they 're johns — what do they know ? I make money hand over fist . Just last week — ”
98941	98950	98951	98951	Connie	554	“ Dolly , please , listen to me ! ”
98957	99023	98951	98951	Connie	554	“ They 're going to do an operation on me . You go look at that woman in the corner , the black woman , Alice . That 's what they want to do to me . At least let me come home for a weekend . To eat real food . To see you and Nita . Please , Dolly , talk to them . ”
99024	99180	99181	99181	She	3044	“ Sure , honey . Once you 're in New York , why should n't you come visit me ? A weekend would n't be so good , but maybe a Sunday together ? It 's nice of Vic to bring me up here , but how many times can I get him to do it ? He knows the value of money . He used to be a real pro ballplayer with the Cleveland Indians . A white pimp is better than a brother , Connie . It 's strictly business , but he brings good customers . Businessmen , buyers , salesmen . When you get out , I 'll get you some money and help you set up in a nice apartment . Daddy took your stuff into storage , he threw a lot of it out . But I kept some for you , pictures and stuff I know you want . ”
99335	99339	99340	99340	he	426	“ After all , "
99350	99395	99340	99340	he	426	“ they made a court case and a bleeding heart publicity brouhaha . about three procedures , while San Francisco Children 's Hospital does hundreds with sound and thermal probes - mostly on neurotic women and intractable children - and no one says boo . "
99420	99441	99414	99414	She	3044	“ Sybil , they 're going to finish us . It 's death , no matter what they call it . ”
99455	99495	99451	99451	Her	418	" It 's true this is a locked ward . But the hospital here has lousy security compared to our old wards . I know I could get out of here , if I could get off this ward . ”
99496	99514	99414	99414	She	3044	" How ? We eat here , we lie here . There 's not even a porch . ”
99515	99527	99451	99451	Her	418	" If I made them think something 's wrong with me . "
99544	99556	99528	99528	Sybil	418	" You could die of smallpox before they 'd do anything . ”
99557	99565	99414	99414	She	3044	“ Would you try if I did ? ”
99578	99582	99571	99571	She	418	" Without money ? "
99583	99629	99708	99708	she	3053	" I have ten dollars . With that we could take a bus for a ways . Then we could hitchhike . Skip says women can alway get a ride . Just so we get away from the hospital .. People are too suspicious here . ”
99631	99645	99571	99571	She	418	" We 'd get picked up before we could reach a bus station . ”
99646	99689	99708	99708	she	3053	“ It 's summer . Suppose we sleep in the woods and we walk as far as we can . They ca n't watch all the bus stations in every town . Please Sybil , if I think up a good plan ? ”
99690	99704	99708	99708	she	3053	" Since the last series of shocks , I do n't have energy . "
99732	99806	99721	99721	Sybil	418	“ But we could help each other . We could keep each other 's courage up . . . . My niece wo n't help ; she 's too spaced out . But if we got to New York , she 'd give us money , I know she would . She 'd be real impressed by 221 you , Sybil . She 's into astrology and she 'd be excited about witchcraft . ”
99807	99853	99708	99708	she	3053	" If we 'd done it sooner ... when we were on L-6 . I 'm tired , Connie , I 'm weak . They 've drained my power . It consumes all my power just to keep out the evil vibrations on this ward . ”
99854	99864	99907	99907	She	3055	" If we got away we 'd be safe ! ”
99865	99892	99721	99721	Sybil	418	" Ten dollars ! That would n't get us far . We have to eat . When they caught us , we 'd be ruthlessly punished ! ”
99893	99906	99907	99907	She	3055	“ Sybil , what are they going to do to us anyhow ? ”
99914	99925	99907	99907	She	3055	" At least they only do it to you once . "
99930	99953	99907	99907	She	3055	“ Is it really worse than electroshock ? I still ca n't remember all kinds of things I know I knew before ! "
99954	99969	99907	99907	She	3055	“ Sybil , you 're getting to be an . . . old patient . ”
99995	100004	100005	100005	Sybil	418	“ Do n't let them wear you down ! ”
100013	100036	100005	100005	Sybil	418	“ I ca n't do it . I have n't healed . My pride is hollow .... But I 'll help you . "
100037	100051	100052	100052	Sybil	418	" They 'll punish you if you help me and I get loose . ”
100055	100068	100052	100052	Sybil	418	“ Not like they 'll punish you when they bring you back . ”
100070	100077	100005	100005	Sybil	418	" I 'll ask someone else . ”
100078	100100	100101	100101	Sybil	418	“ Do n't you dare ! Have n't we been friends ? Do n't you think my loyalty has some value ? ”
100106	100150	100103	100103	herself	418	" Perhaps if you do escape , I 'll consider it in a new light . It 's by far the most intelligent plan for you to escape first with my assistance . Then when you 're safe , you can assist me . ”
100223	100237	100215	100215	Jackrabbit	377	“ We 'll get dressed , Connie . Do n't hide , away ! ”
100314	100321	100324	100324	her	309	“ Our family met last night , ”
100326	100393	100322	100322	Jackrabbit	377	" I put in as ready for mothering and military service . But everybody decided I ought to take care of going on defense before starting to mother . I know it 's logical , but I feel a little parted . I want to mother a lot more than I feel like marching off for six months to wherever the enemy 's pestering us now . ”
100407	100414	100394	100394	Luciente	309	“ What 's wrong , Connie ? ”
100445	100453	100428	100428	She	309	“ So soon . It promises ill . ”
100454	100472	100473	100473	Jackrabbit	377	" It 's bad , real bad ? That 's what I thought . I 'm scared . "
100491	100573	100488	100488	Luciente	309	“ It 's that race between technology , in the service , of those who control , and insurgency — those who want to change the society in our direction . In your time the physical sciences had delivered the weapons technology . But the crux , we think , is in the biological sciences . Control of genetics . Tech- · nology of brain control . Birth - to - death surveillance . Chemical control through psychoactive drugs and neurotransmitters . ”
100574	100581	100586	100586	she	309	“ Luciente , help me escape ! ”
100593	100601	100586	100586	she	309	“ Before they do that to me . ”
100605	100634	100635	100635	She	309	“ Sticking a log in somebody 's eye to dig out an eyelash ! They had not even a theory of memory ! Their arrogance ... amazes me . ”
100638	100646	100635	100635	She	309	" Can you help me ? Please . ”
100647	100653	100654	100654	Jackrabbit	377	" Of course we can ! "
100671	100682	100683	100683	she	309	" I ca n't interfere in the past , Connie , ”
100687	100715	100683	100683	she	309	“ But I can give you advice . That 's free as the wind . As we say , nobody asks for it and everybody gets it . ”
100716	100740	100654	100654	Jackrabbit	377	" I thought I might fake a sickness scary enough to make them take me off the ward and then I could escape . ”
100741	100779	100780	100780	Luciente	309	“ You 'd have to be able to create and sustain a high temperature . I could teach you , but it 'd take time . I must discuss these problems with my time - travel proj . "
100870	100890	100891	100891	Connie	554	" I 'm sorry I bothered the two of you . I guess you were planning to be alone , ”
100902	100961	100891	100891	Connie	554	" It 's like my naming . Every time I take a step , I start jagging . I want to go back where I was . Not really . But I need Luci today , I need a clear interseeing of who I am and what I was wanting . I feel lost , a little bottomed . ”
100962	100972	101036	101036	she	309	" You do n't want to go on defense ? ”
100973	101005	101006	101006	He	377	“ Fasure I do . I put in for it . Only , after I make a decision , I feel thinned . As if I just lost eight other selves . "
101041	101091	101036	101036	she	309	“ Everybody agrees your pass is urgent . But no one is confident you can learn to control body temperature in a week . Marat recommends acute appendicitis , a common health problem in your time . It was n't always accompanied by fever and could be easily faked . "
101092	101096	101097	101097	Connie	554	" No good ! ”
101100	101164	101097	101097	Connie	554	“ They would n't think it was such a big emergency . Why take me off ward ? They 'd wait till the doctor came in . Weekend is the time to get out , because they 're understaffed . And , Luciente , appendicitis , it 's not contagious . They never believe us anyhow when we say we 're in pain . "
101165	101192	101036	101036	she	309	" Zo , what about a head injury ? Faking unconsciousness is easy . I could teach you to go into delta in a few lessons . "
101193	101198	101199	101199	Connie	554	“ Let me think . ”
101212	101217	101199	101199	Connie	554	“ What 's that ? ”
101218	101244	101245	101245	Connie	554	" Careful ! It 's a weapon . I did n't get a chance to turn it in today . We had practice at noon . ”
101250	101259	101245	101245	Connie	554	“ I 'm trying to think . Maybe . ”
101271	101286	101260	101260	Luciente	309	" Corydora here . Thought you were planning to test those results from Tennessee . ”
101287	101298	101347	101347	she	309	“ Tonight . I 'll do it tonight after supper . "
101301	101314	101260	101260	Luciente	309	" Thought we were having a town meeting about the Shaping controversy . "
101315	101332	101333	101333	Luciente	309	" Fasure . Will do it between supper and the meeting . I set everything up . ”
101383	101403	101376	101376	she	309	“ Morningstar , can you take Dawn to have her teeth checked ? I 'm caught to my neck . ”
101410	101439	101405	101405	she	309	“ My appleblossom , Morningstar is taking you to Goat Hill . I will see you at supper and tomorrow we 'll work together in the upper fields . "
101543	101569	101523	101523	Luciente	309	" I think I want to learn how to play dead ... or knocked out anyhow . I 'll let you know for sure tomorrow . ”
101570	101581	101582	101582	Luciente	309	" I 'll ask Magdalena how best to teach you , ”
101590	101612	101613	101613	Embarrassed	606	" In about an hour I 'll ask her . Tomorrow.morning , Connie sweetness , graze me and we 'll start . ”
101620	101642	101615	101615	Connie	554	“ Tina , please . Watch for us . I want to talk to Sybil for a minute only . Momentito ? ”
101676	101685	101671	101671	Connie	554	“ Would you stage a fight with me ? "
101693	101697	101686	101686	Sybil	418	“ Why not ? ”
101698	101714	101686	101686	Sybil	418	" They 'll give it to you afterward . They 'll come down on you . "
101715	101737	101686	101686	Sybil	418	" Maybe they 'll send me off this ward . Outside I know the rules . I 'm an old hand . ”
101738	101747	101686	101686	Sybil	418	" Maybe they 'll just do you sooner . ”
101749	101767	101768	101768	She	554	“ Maybe the saddest person will be the last to be done . ' Like death row . ”
101941	101950	101951	101951	Connie	554	“ What 's all this business about Shaping ? ”
101959	101967	101968	101968	Bee	378	“ The Shapers want to intervene genetically , "
101971	101989	101968	101968	Bee	378	“ Now we only spot problems , watch for birth defects , genes linked with disease susceptibility . ”
101990	102000	102001	102001	Luciente	309	" The Shapers want to breed for selected traits , ”
102004	102013	102001	102001	Luciente	309	“ It 's a grandcil - level fight . ”
102014	102020	102021	102021	she	309	“ What do you think ? "
102029	102065	102025	102026	White Oak	468	“ Oh , we three are all Mixers . That 's the other side . We do n't think people can know objectively how people should become . We think it 's a power surge . ”
102070	102092	102067	102067	Luciente	309	“ Look , there 's my notice . Two people signed up last night . But we need at least five . ”
102098	102107	102093	102093	Connie	554	“ Why do you want to learn Chinese ? ”
102108	102129	102067	102067	Luciente	309	“ They do interesting work in my field . On my next sabbatical , I 'm going to travel there . "
102130	102138	102067	102067	Luciente	309	“ Bee , will you go too ? ”
102139	102190	102191	102191	She	554	“ Not so . I traveled too much when I was involved in reparations to former colonies . I never want to move my body again ! I got so weary . No , on sabbatical I want to follow a line of research our base decided against - foolishly . ”
102196	102207	102191	102191	She	554	“ Will you really go off to China without him ? ”
102208	102223	102067	102067	Luciente	309	“ How not ? For half a year . Person wo n't run away . "
102224	102268	102269	102270	White Oak	468	" Ah , but without you to argue with day and night , my brain will turn into a jellyfish . You 'll come back and find me a Shaper . Who 'll keep me politically correct , who 'll chew me over ? ”
102289	102349	102350	102350	Bee	378	“ Someday the past will die , the last scar heal , the last rubbish crumble to good dirt , the last radioactive waste decay to silence and no more in the crevices of the earth will poisons roll . Sweet earth , I lie in your lap , I borrow your strength , I win you every day . ”
102378	102420	102422	102422	Bee	378	" Someday water will run clear , salmon will thunder upstream , whales will spout just offshore , and no more in the depths of the sea will the dark bombs roll . Sweet earth , I lie in your lap ... "
102541	102583	102537	102537	Luciente	309	" Keep quiet now or leave , Dawn . Connie must fix on escaping from the bad place that holds per against per will . Next week , if Connie escapes , person will answer all the questions you can ask . "
102591	102611	102588	102588	Connie	554	“ That 's the first time I heard anyone say no — you know , discipline a child here . ”
102612	102632	102633	102633	She	554	“ I have to explain . Dawn must comprend the situation . And per questions will be given time . ”
102763	102784	102758	102758	Luciente	309	“ Noon I meet Bolivar . We are eating a sandwich by the river and communing -- or trying to ! ”
102791	102800	102785	102785	Luciente	309	“ Do you like per better , Mommy ? ”
102810	102835	102801	102801	Dawn	400	" I 'm trying . Bumpy fasure , but I 'm trying . So is Bolivar . But it 's like dog and cat . "
102836	102843	102844	102845	White Oak	468	" What do you talk about ? ”
102848	102851	102852	102852	Luciente	309	“ Childhood , ”
102859	102877	102852	102852	Luciente	309	“ It 's the only thing we have found in common , besides Jackrabbit , so far . ”
102878	102888	102889	102889	Connie	554	“ Half the people I see are yawning today , ”
102893	102895	102896	102896	Luciente	309	“ Ohl "
102899	102951	102952	102952	she	309	“ We were up till past midnight arguing the Shaping question . We had coffee twice . We 're taking a night off to catch up on sleep and then meeting again tomorrow night to argue out our village posit . Barbarossa and Luxembourg are on the other side , grasp , ”
102958	102965	102952	102952	she	309	“ Got to work on them . ”
103220	103360	103361	103361	Sybil	418	" Why ca n't we socialize with other wards ? On my old ward , every few weeks at least we had a nice social visit with another ward . We had Kool - Aid and cookies . Here we do n't have anything . We ca n't even see movies . We do n't get occupational therapy . We do n't attend dance therapy . We do n't even take part in industrial therapy . Last time I was here , I worked in the laundry . Why not this time ? This is exactly like a back ward , that 's what it 's like . We do n't even have group therapy ! We must be the only functional patients in the entire hospital who do n't go to group therapy at least once a week ! ”

Put a bunch of the most violent hard cases in the hospital in here without enough security and what do you expect ? I better give a call and see if Dr. Clausen 's asleep . In the meantime go wake up the orderly . Tell him to take her down to the X - ray till we see if we got anybody to operate it . Oh , shit ! Why could n't they do this on a Monday night ?

105296	107654	107655	107655	Luciente	309	“ to everyone I love .. Live long enough to bake a brick for the house we share . Let me fight like a tiger and leave something pretty like a moon snail on the common beach . The words formed themselves in her mind and she hummed as she walked . Right foot , left foot . With her head tilted , she looked into the clear sky . Almost overhead a big red star shone . A little to the north , still high up in the sky , she found the Big Dipper . West and a little lower down , a sickle of stars hung . She wished she could remember how to find the North Star . Her father had shown her when she was a child . To leave the state highway would make her safer , but if she did she had no idea how to get to the next town . Again a police car came shining its spotlight lazily to both sides of the road . In the tall weeds of the drainage ditch she lay on her belly , glad that it had not rained for days . A mosquito settled on her leg and patiently sucked out her blood as she lay waiting for the police to leave . As she came to the next crossroads and raced across under high arc lights , she noticed that her green print dress was stained with dirt . She was less acceptable - looking than ever . A gas station stood on the far corner of the crossroads , dark and shut for the night . She tried the doors of the bathrooms . The men 's had been left . unlocked Blood on her face . She looked like an accident victim . She did not dare keep the light on but sat down to rest with a pile of wet towels and cleansed herself , sponging dirt from her dress as well as she could . Helping herself to a nice big stack of toilet paper and a few paper towels , she tucked them away in the smock , which she put on to protect her dress . It was white and might stand out , but if she was too dirty she would never escape notice when it was time to get on a bus . In the pocket of the smock she found a wad of paper handkerchiefs , a pack of Kools with five left and a book of matches . She turned the latter over in her palm reverently . For four months she had been forbidden possession of this dangerous weapon and scrap of dignity : a pack of matches . The picture on the cover showed a man carrying a briefcase and smiling broadly . It invited her to go back to school and train for a great career through the mail . Even without a high school diploma she could earn $ $ $ $ $ $ $ preparing income taxes after only one eight - week mail order course . She wished she could go back to school . In Luciente 's time everybody studied as long as they wanted to . They took courses all the time in fours and fives and sixes . What would she study ? She hardly knew where she would want 234 to begin . She was an ignorant woman ; sometimes she pitied Luciente for lighting on her , when what did she know ? Reluctantly she rose from the tiled floor . The room stank ' less than the bathrooms in the hospital . It was wonderful to use the toilet alone , with no one looking at her . To shut the door of the toilet stall . Wonderful to wash her face , her hands , her body and feet carefully in the basin . Her feet were swollen but they felt better after a soak . She took the tiny bit of soap left and wrapped it carefully in a paper towel . Though she was eager to get back into the dark again and away from the intersection , on the chance that there might be a key left in the ignition , she checked all the cars parked behind the garage . They had taken the keys . In one , however , she found a state map , in another a pair of sunglasses ( for disguise , maybe ? ) , and in the trunk of an old white Thunderbird , someone had left a denim jacket . She tried it on . Better than the lab coat . She rolled back the sleeves and transferred her ten dollars , five cigarettes , the precious matches , the map to the pockets of the denim jacket . Then she folded the smock and tucked it under her arm . . ' Then a panic whirled up in her for spending half an hour at the station and she began trotting down the drainage ditch beside the highway . Fatigue made her weak . As she trotted , then slowed to a walk , she nodded out and dreamed in snatches . Dolly and she were drinking café con leche very sweet in Dolly 's steamy kitchen . Nita sat on her lap , cuddling . She was letting Nita take a bite of her doughnut , soaked in the sweet milky coffee . Car . She fell forward blindly and struck something sharp with her arm . She lay still , her arm hurting , while the car swept slowly past . Something rusty . Luckily it had not cut her but had only bruised the skin . The jacket had protected her . She crawled forward and then shakily rose . She walked and walked . The moon sank into the trees . Trucks passed . She spent as much time lying in the ditch as she did on her feet walking . She stumbled . Fell again . At the next intersection she waited , looking in all directions before that stretch of pavement . There had been a gas station here too but it had gone out of business and the pumps hauled away . On the corner nearest her a produce stand was shuttered and padlocked for the night . She could find no easy way in . Behind it fruit and vegetables 235 were thrown in the garbage , not good enough to sell . A rat stood its ground , then leisurely waddled into the tall grass as she approached . She was afraid to poke around . What a smell . Rotting fruit , rotting greens . Her stomach humped . She shook her head hard . She must eat . She forced herself to pick through the garbage until she had ' rescued some carrots , a yellow cabbage , some black but edible bananas , and a few sprouted potatoes . The denim jacket held them all except for the bananas , which she ate as she walked on . Her hands stank . Patience . Wait . In the drainage ditch on the far side of the intersection , a small stream was running . Water in this drought . Taking off her shoes , she tried to wade in it but the water stank and the bottom was slippery with muck . She chose to walk on the side of the ditch away from the road , nervous because hiding was more difficult and the going rougher . Tall weeds tore at her legs and slowed her . She felt visible when she saw headlights or heard an engine and crouched in the tall grass beside the stream . Her feet were raw . When she sat on a stone , she discovered her sole had worn a hole . She tried to patch the hole with a paper towel , but that created a lump that blistered her foot . She could not walk farther and the sky was beginning to lighten . She had to get off the road . Limping now between the stream and a barbed - wire fence with some crop growing on the other side , she could see no escape but forced herself on . The air was a thin gray , watery as institutional soup . She hardly had the energy to drop flat as cars approached , and in fact in her stupor a car came from behind without her realizing until it had gone past . By luck it was not searching for her , for it never slackened its speed . She was too exhausted to march on , but she could see no place to hide . She tried to walk faster on her last strength with oozing feet , through the air that betrayed her , growing thinner at each step . She forced her sore and sweaty legs on , swollen , bruised , stumbling beside the polluted ditch with its water flowing sluggishly in the same unknown direction . She saw a patch of woods across the road . She had to wade the foul water again and then scramble up the embankment to the road and make a run for it . But she could no longer run . She hobbled across the pavement , vast and gray in the half light . Forever she picked up her 236 ard . Her she came last sing - leaden hoofs and crumpled forward . Her feet were damp with blood and fluid from broken blisters . She crossed the wide pavement with skid marks etched on it . At last she flung herself down the other embankment without pausing to look , because she heard the sound of an engine . No stream ran at the bottom here . She landed on a pile of broken bottles she rolled over limply . Hunched , she began to make her way forward , falling on her belly as cars approached . Lighter still . Now she could see clearly as far as a city block — and be seen . Then she reached the first scraggly tree of the woods . A barbed - wire fence ran along this side of the highway also , but she found a spot where she could use a wad of weeds and her white smock to push the rusted wires till she could crawl over . Then she thrust blindly through the brush until she was out of sight of the road . She collapsed . Something crawled on her leg . She picked off a tick and flung it . Got up . With the road behind her , she forced her way through the brush toward taller trees . Finally she stood in a grove of tall feathery white pine with occasional young oaks coming up beneath them . The floor was reddish brown needles , beautiful and sweet - smelling . She picked a spot under a tall tree and spread the smock . Lying down with her head on it , she slept almost immediately , collapsing into the thick sleep of exhaustion . 237 . Twelve lntcouncula 3 í 1 4 W HEN Connie awoke she lay a moment , confused . Her brain felt swollen . Her head ached as if she had really had concussion . Her legs were stiff , sore , and itchy with bites . The sun stood well into the western sky . Yet she was free , she was still free . She felt bewildered with space and half drunk . - Sitting up , she rubbed her legs . What a mess her feet were . The shoes had begun to fall apart ; the soles were parting from the uppers . Rising stiffly , she hung them on a branch to dry . If only she could manage to look neater . If she had a comb . If her dress were cleaner . Clothing made such a difference in how people saw you . Often clothing was all they saw . A clean , neat dress and she could break through and be gone . But in her dirty green dress and borrowed man 's denim jacket , with the white smock as second hope , she shook her head ruefully . Peeling off the yellow outer leaves , she nibbled the raw cabbage from her pocket , while her stomach cringed , not having had anything tougher than stew to work on in months . She chewed and chewed the cabbage . Then she gnawed the carrots . Although this food did n't feel like food , it was something . She dreamed of bread and café con leche - all the breads of New York . French breads in long bakery loaves . The dark Jewish pumpernickels . Then tostadas , tortillas . The spoon bread Claud had liked her to make . Big hot pretzels men peddled on the streets from 238 carts , keeping their hands warm in the winter over the fires . She leaned back on the trunk of her pine , trying to think what to do . The poor vegetables had eased the dryness in her throat , but she must find water and food . She could not leave her cover until darkness , and in the meantime she would rest her feet . She still had ten dollars , she had a road map , she was free . The woods smelled wonderful . The light slanted between the trunks and trickled through the pines over her : the needles were soft and fragrant under her . But she had n't the faintest idea how to look for food and drink . She could n't eat a tree . Her head against the trunk , she watched small birds flit to and fro while a bigger bird kicked up the needles , looking for insects . "

108057	108106	108107	108107	Luciente	309	” Cautiously they crept back into the second growth beside the roadside and poked through the weeds and bushes . Numerous aluminum beer and soda cans lay there , as did pop strips . They also found intact bottles and jars and some usable sharp pieces of glass . “
108118	108119	108120	108120	We	3186	” “
108134	108152	108107	108107	Luciente	309	” Luciente said cheerfully , grubbing among the weeds and occasionally pulling one with a pleased grimace . "

108189	108190	108191	108191	We	3186	” “
108422	108432	108412	108412	Rose	376	” Luciente was identifying various weeds as she crawled . “
108493	108563	108564	108564	They	3199	" . She crawled after Luciente , barefoot through the brush . Twenty feet away trucks and cars swept past at fifty miles an hour . Occasionally a car would pass more slowly and both women froze . The brush hid them , but there was no point moving the leaves suspiciously . The day was hot and the leaves near the road were dusty and smelled of smoke . “
108571	108575	108564	108564	They	3199	" Luciente frowned . “
108591	108687	108582	108582	We	3200	” In spite of the pain , as she stumbled after Luciente she began to enjoy herself . Scrabbling around in the bushes made her feel like a child — a six - year - old playing in the fields near her home . Her legs and back ached , her arms and legs were cut in a dozen places , her wrists and ankles were ringed with mosquito bites . Yet she felt silly with happiness gathering up the weeds that Luciente pointed out . So much exercise made her cough repeatedly and spit . “
108698	108699	108582	108582	We	3200	" "
108722	108726	108705	108705	you	3198	” Luciente said . “
108759	108768	108745	108745	I	0	” She took a cautious bite and winced . “
108776	108777	108745	108745	I	0	" "
108824	110052	110053	110053	I	0	” Leaning against the white pine that had become home , she chewed the chickweed , which tasted exactly as she 'd expect a mouthful of weeds to taste , and chewed and chewed and swallowed . it . No worse than hospital food , really ; just stranger . The sun had sunk to the height when it usually disappeared behind the administration building next to the hospital . About four . She did not even worry . She was too glad to be outside , even in this patch of woods with her feet raw , waiting to graze on the grasses of the field like a cow put out to pasture . She felt happy as a Cow was supposed to feel chewing its cud . She knew some of the giddiness , some of the feeling that she could sleep and sleep , was from coming off the medication . She hoped 241 Luciente would find water . The foul stuff in the drainage ditch would probably kill her . Well , chewing the weeds helped . Luciente had found some wild onions and they made her saliva flow and relieved the soreness in her throat . She noticed her hands had a tendency to shake . That tremor seemed to get worse as the day wore on . Thorazine and barbiturate withdrawal . It would help if she had water . But a strange tranquility filled her . She felt space around her body , the space of privacy and choice . Comparing herself with a cow , she felt more human than she had since ... oh , since she 'd been with Claud . When she had talked about Claud to Luciente , Luciente had been shocked that Claud was a pickpocket . They had worked the well - dressed crowds , the businessmen , the women who shopped on Fifth Avenue . If she searched herself , she found a pride that she had learned those skills , that she had been useful to Claud . They made a living , they could eat out in the neighborhood and buy clothes and keep Angelina looking pretty the way she ought to be . Money to go to the dentist . Money for a new couch bought on time ; Naugahyde it was , just like leather , and Claud liked to stretch out on it . ( To feel pride . Oh , she had been allowed to feel that briefly when she had gone to the community college in Chicago to study to be a teacher . How she had studied , spreading out her books on a table in the library ( too noisy at home ) . She did not have a typewriter , and no matter how carefully she wrote out her papers , she noticed that her grades were lower for that . She had learned to type in high school , she had taken a whole year , and now she had a job typing . She asked her boss if she could stay late to use the typewriter for her school papers , but he acted suspicious , as if she wanted to hang around to steal something . Chuck , in her American history course , said she could use his typewriter if she 'd type his papers too . He had a fancy electric machine , but he could n't type . She thought that was funny , but she accepted the bargain . Some bargain . A baby in her belly by March and the end of her schooling , her pride , her hope . Married to Martín a year later , she had been proud . Shé swatted a mosquito sitting up on skinny legs about to sink its probe in her thigh . But not proud of herself . No . She felt hollow with shame after her Anglo boyfriend Chuck had deserted her . After she had had to leave school , 242 after her family had thrown her out , after she had spent all she had on a six - hundred - dollar abortion done without anaesthetic . Neither baby nor husband , neither diploma nor home . No name . Nobody . Woman spoiled . Chingada . Martin 's love had given her worth . She had feared the loss of his love every day . She spent her time fearing it , walking the line of decorum like a tightrope , lowering her eyes to all other men , speaking only when spoken to . She had loved him . How she had loved him . It had been easy . He had been beautiful , his body like the molten sun , coppery and golden at once , his body in which strength and grace were balanced as in a great cat . His body had been almost girlish in its slenderness - although she would never have dared to say that in any way , for that very thought expressed would have lost him to her — and masculine in its swiftness , its muscular tight control . No wonder Parra had made her remember him . Beautiful , Martín had been , with his face of sadness and grace , his eyes like brown rivers with something moving warily in their depths . His smile that opened like a box of light . His hands nervous as the little birds that darted through the pine boughs . He used to split matches in two while he sat talking at the kitchen table . In the madhouse inmates did that , on the rare occasions they acquired a match . But he did it just because his hands had to be occupied . He had a car , yes , a Mustang the color of gold , and he stood in the street carefully washing and polishing it on Saturday . After he was killed , the company repossessed it . What would she have wanted with it , the chariot of his pride ? With Martín she had been proud with a tremor like the drug withdrawal now , proud of his love but fearful of losing what she could not deserve . He felt lent ; always she had expected his loss to another woman who would not come to him stained . But she lost him to the street . In this odd moment she recalled him peacefully , her young husband , How he would stare to see her now , used and battered . If he appeared before her , he would seem as young as Jackrabbit . Of all she had lost , he was the sweet one she could least afford to call back from the dead , from the garbage bin where the poor were cast , for she was no longer a mate for him . But once , once she had held him supple and sinewy and hot in her arms , she had trembled under him , shy and shaken . Long ago . She had loved him well . As she should have loved her daughter . young tersebar di he appeared 243 When Luciente came back , walking lightly on the needles , she greeted her : “
110062	110069	110058	110058	Dawn	400	” Luciente frowned , sitting down . “

110159	110204	110157	110157	her	400	” A few minutes later Dawn stood under the pines wearing blue overalls . Her hair had been cut shorter , her skin was toasted brown , and she wore a neat bandage that looked somehow sealed to the skin of her arm . - "

My fever rose and I felt dreadful . A person helped me lower my fever and the dipper rerouted to a hospital for me ... Traveling I always meet people I exchange pleasure with a meal , a conversation , a coupling , interseeing , a making of music , drumming to their slide playing . ... Locked in a metal box , how I could make contact ? The accidents they had were bumping of metal on flesh . Our accidents are bumping of flesh against flesh , the brushing of lives "

May come to feel that it 's part of the essence of Gray Fox to make big decisions while others look up to per . May come to feel that being Gray Fox involves being such a 251 decider , such a big visible doer . So right now Gray Fox is on sixmonth sheepherding duty . After we 've served in a way that seems important , we serve in a job usually done by young people waiting to begin an apprenticeship or crossers atoning a crime .

119889	120276	120277	120277	Jackrabbit	377	” D Jackrabbit was showing her a bunch of ... what ? Dream images ? Sculptures in light ? Shapes that reshaped themselves into other shapes ? She felt nervous looking at them with the person who made them , the artist , right there making it happen . She was afraid she would n't seem appreciative or would n't say the right things or look the right way , and he 'd think she was stupid . But there at her elbow was Luciente , eating white grapes from a woven basket and grunting rough enjoyment as if it were just a TV program . If she tried to think about what the images were supposed to mean , she felt miserable . But if she looked with her eyes open and let them happen to her , she could not help getting drawn in . The holi he was showing now had no words , no story , unlike the one he 'd done with Bolivar . It was all images having something to do with the ocean and with sex and with power -- not power over people , but natural power , energy . Boundaries dissolving . -The sea rising , smashing into the land . Under a clear cold blue sky a sea lashed itself into foam and sprang at the shore . Waves with teeth that glinted and hair that tangled and tossed roiled over itself . Wave breaking over wave showed dark bellies arching before they crashed down in froth and slid on the sand spent and hissed dribbling back . Jackrabbit 's workshop stood near the mill , near enough to hear the wheel turning . There the river ground grains and corn and operated a series of pumps . Four times a day a tidal clock swung the wheel mechanism about so that it was always fixed correctly in the flow of waters . When Jackrabbit did not opaque the window and use only the sliding skylight , ripples danced on his high ceiling . Always , he told her , he could hear the mill wheel , the waves slapping the shore just underneath . The workshop was built out some feet over the river , and the side facing the water had a narrow porch . "
120283	120310	120280	120281	two students	3542	” Luciente said , leaning on the railing outside the open door while Connie looked through the drawings and prints Jackrabbit started to show her next . “

120451	120477	120442	120442	You	3544	” Luciente kicked off her shoes and sat with her bare feet hanging off the porch , but she could not quite reach the water . "

120567	120720	120565	120565	you	3544	” Connie looked away from the radiant male nude that hung on the far wall , along with twenty other paintings , drawings , prints , whatever . A naked male body hung like that - doubly hung - embarrassed her . It did not seem like something she should stare at , yet the colors glowed , the flesh shone from within . She kept glancing at it , nervously , from the corner of her eye . It was beautiful when it should not have been - like Martín , her first husband . She could not imagine him permitting anyone to paint him that way , yet if someone with talent had , his flesh would have shone so . It was neither Jackrabbit nor Bolivar . Unless Bolivar seven years younger with a bushy beard ? Luciente turned , propped her back against a post of the railing . "

122503	122816	122817	122817	You	3603	” Tina was playing a violin and dropped her hands quickly as he turned to leave . Connie brooded over what he had said about Skip . It was true , Skip had changed . He parroted back whatever they said to him ; he told them he was grateful . When they took him out and tested him with homosexual photographs , he had no what they called negative reactions . Meaning he did n't get a hard - on . He told her he felt dead inside . They were pleased with him ; they were going to write him up for a medical journal . Skip wanted to get out . They promised he would . She wondered . Would they really let him out of their clutches ? His bandages were off now and his hair was beginning to grow back . He walked around the ward , helping the attendants . He was playing the game . It was still a game , she sensed that ; there was a remnant of strong will gone cold at the core pushing him . She had tried to escape in her way , he was trying in his way , with something gutted in him . Something beautiful and quick was burned out . It hurt her to watch him . Because he was too beautiful and tempted them , they had fixed him . He moved differently : clumsily . It was as if he had finally agreed to imitate the doctors ' coarse , clumsy masculinity for a time , but it was mastery with them and humility with him . He moved like a robot not expertly welded . Yet he was no robot , whatever they thought they had done . She could feel the will burning in him , a will to burst free . "
122827	122841	122825	122825	you	3603	” She came up beside him as he was mopping the day room . "
122845	122982	122983	122983	It	3605	” he asked her . He had become friendly again , but he no longer flirted or told her wild stories . He was 270 numb , stripped to a wire of will she could feel . They had not burned out or cut out as much as they thought , she hoped . Something of Skip survived . 271 Fourteen > ACKRABBIT went on defense . For a week Luciente sank into a low energy state that made it hard for them to connect . Then she took a day 's retreat at Treefrog and seemed herself to Connie . Lunch at Mattapoisett was yellow soup thickened with tidbits of shrimp , crab , clam , and fish . Hawk was eating with them again , after several weeks with her friend Thunderbolt 's family . "
123030	123201	123025	123026	a guest	2368	” Connie had often seen visitors besides herself , mostly people from nearby villages or others on their way through , traveling on some piece of business . Sometimes a whole troupe of players or musicians stopped for a week . Old friends or former mems came visiting . Then there were the people without village called politely drifters and impolitely puffs . Once she had seen a man with a small tattoo on his palm , which Luciente told her marked a crime of violence . Unlike the other guests , drifters often sat apart . People seemed uncomfortable with them . Sometimes they seemed to know each other , and when Connie passed near them , she heard a slang she did not recognize . Why did Hawk bring this guest to the table ? Connie saw 272 on his palm that same tattoo , that warning mark . He was a big - boned oversized man with little flesh on him , perhaps in his late thirties . "

In your time thousands of species were disappearing . We need that wild genetic material to breed with . . . . That 's only the answer from the narrow viewpoint of my own science . ”
123825	123831	123832	123832	he	378	“ Good luck in Oldtown ! ”

123867	123881	123832	123832	he	378	“ I have to fall by Oldtown later and present our new recks . ”

123886	123917	123918	123918	Connie	554	" Half word , half rib . Grasp , it 's a request but we wish it was a requisition . For what we want to do scientifically this winter . "
123940	123955	123936	123936	she	554	“ It 's so hard for me to think of you as a scientist ! ”
123956	123965	123832	123832	he	378	" How not ? I do n't comprend . "
123966	124010	123832	123832	he	378	“ I mean the only scientist I know is Dr. Redding . ... I guess we 're his experiments . But I 'd hardly ever meet a scientist , I mean , like in East Harlem . Not that I 'd want to ... "
124011	124025	123936	123936	she	554	“ What 's different about meeting a scientist and meeting a shelf diver ? ”
124026	124286	123832	123832	he	378	“ Like my sister Inez , she lives in New Mexico . Her husband drinks , she has seven kids . After the sixth , she went to the clinic for the pill . You know - No , you ca n't ! It 's so hard for a woman like her - a real Catholic , not lapsed like me , under his thumb too and him filling her with babies one right after the other so hard for her · to say , Basta ya ! And go for the pill . See , she thought she went to a doctor . But he had his scientist cap on and he was experimenting . She thought it was good she got the 274 pill free . But they gave her a sugar pill instead . This doctor , he did n't say what he was doing . So she got heavy again with the seventh child . It was born with something wrong . She 's tired and worn out with making babies . You know you have too many and the babies are n't so strong anymore . They 're dear to you but a little something wrong . So this one , Richard , he was born dim in the head . Now they have all that worry and money troubles . They 're supposed to give him pills and send him to a special school , but it costs . All because Inez thought she had a doctor , but she got a scientist . ”
124287	124294	124295	124295	Luciente	309	“ All this is really so ? ”
124398	124435	124706	124706	It	5806	“ They like to try out medicine on poor people . Especially brown people and black people . Inmates in prisons too . So ... you must test drugs on people too ? You have to . "
124436	124472	124706	124706	It	5806	" We use computers for biological modeling . Most drugs are discarded long before the testing stage . In your time I think people talked about effects and side effects , but that 's nonsense . ”
124473	124518	124706	124706	It	5806	" How ? Like when I take Thorazine , the effects are controlling me , making me half dead , but I get lots of side effects , believe me , like sore throat and . . . constipation , dizziness , funny speech . ”
124519	124560	124561	124561	She	3651	“ But , Connie blossom , all are effects ! Your drug companies labeled things side effects they did n't want as selling points . It 's a funny way to look at things , like a horse in blinkers . ”
124567	124585	124561	124561	She	3651	“ But there 's a difference . The main effect is the thing you do something for . ”
124586	124617	124618	124618	They	3652	" But Connie ! The world does n't know that . Do n't you see ? Let 's go around this way - the bees have been set out today . ”

Inside the fish domes , men and women , gleaming with sweat , were working wearing only brief shorts . Outside there was a special cooling - off pool with people splashing and swimming in it . “

They were cruising past Mattapoisett now , past the weir , and Morningstar , who was loading boxes of pillows and comforters on a boat , stopped to wave . They passed the bridge to Cranberry and pedaled 276 toward the wharves of Oldtown . "
125239	125286	125287	125287	They	3683	" They left the bike at one of the racks and walked along a path in Oldtown , where the main harbor was . It was a Portuguese village whose main activities were boatbuilding , boat repair , shell - fishing and deep - sea fishing . “

An old man with a wispy beard was slowly picking blackberries , eating some , putting most in a basket over his withered arm , on what must once have been the lawn of a resort hotel . With him was a child who was eating rather more than picking and singing with him sometimes in unison and sometimes in a bouncy counterpoint , interrupting with questions every few minutes which he slowly answered .

126181	127333	126163	126163	We	3690	" Seconal or not , she did not sleep that night . The next morning they were coming for her , they were going to take her to the hospital where they performed the actual operations . Night before the electric chair . She stared into the thin dark , the light on down the ball at the nurses ' station , where the weekend night crew were playing contract bridge . They had an ongoing game in which the night , nurse played partners with Stan the Man , the women 's attendant Jean played partners with the orderly Chris . The nurse and Stan the Man were ten years older than Jean and Chris , and they called their game the Generation Gap . They were full of jokes and drank beer all night . Although their game was noisy , they were not what was keeping her awake , no more than Tina 's soft mumbled snoring from the other bed . It was the morning to come . Tomorrow they were going to stick a machine in her brain . She was the experiment . They would rape her body , her brain , her self . After this she could not trust her own feelings . She would not be her own . She would be their experimental monster . Their plaything , like Alice . Their tool . She did not want to pass over to Mattapoisett tonight ; she wanted to taste the last dregs of her identity before they took it from her . BONUS Lying in the partial dark , she found anger swelling up in her like sour wind . There was n't enough ! Oh , not enough things , sure not enough food to eat , clothes to wear , all of that . But there was n't enough ... to do . To enjoy . Ugliness had surrounded her , had imprisoned her all her life . The vgliness of tenements , of slums , of El Barrio — whether of El Paso , Chicago , or New York — the grimy walls , the stinking streets , the stained air , the dark halls smelling of piss and stale cooking oil , the life like an open sore , had ground away her strength . 279 Whoever owned this place , these cities , whoever owned those glittering glassy office buildings in midtown filled with the purr of money turning over , those refineries over the river in Jersey with their flames licking the air , they gave nothing back . They took and took and left their garbage choking the air , the river , the sea itself . Choking her . A life of garbage . Human garbage . She had had too little of what her body needed and too little of what her soul could imagine . She had been able to do little in the years of her life , and that little had been ill paid or punished . The rest was garbage . Who could ever pay for the pain of bringing a child into dirt and pain ? Never enough . Nothing you wanted to give her you ever could give her , including yourself , what you wanted to be with her and for her . Nothing you wanted for her could come true . Who could ever pay for the pain of rising day after day year after year in a dim room dancing with cockroaches , and looking out on a street like a sewer of slow death ? All her life it felt to her she had been dying a cell at a time , a cell of hope , of joy , of love , little lights going out one by one . When her body had turned all to pain , would she die ? Die and poison the earth į like a plague victim , like so many pounds of lead ? Outside the trees were turning early , from the drought . The branches of the pines ended in brown nosegays of dead needles . They were cutting their losses . The maples and oaks sported branches already bronze , a dulled version of autumn color . The sky was , a hazy buff blue , as if it were dusty for miles up . By nine o'clock , when they took her over to the other hospital , it was already hot for September . They did not cut and shave her head until she was on the new ward . Valente had told Dr. Redding it upset the patients . The cold touch of the scissors nudged her nape , her ear with its shivery weight like a shark nosing past . With each clack of the blades , her hair fell from her , to lie like garbage on the floor . To be swept up and thrown away . No blackberry bushes would grow from her head 's shearing . Rich in nitrogen and trace Clements : Luciente was always saying things like that . But Luciente was not with her this morning . Sybil had stood at the door watching her go , her face working as she tried not to weep . In her mind now she 280 could see Sybil 's auburn hair falling , the long beautiful hair of a fine natural red that varied strand to strand . Often she had brushed Sybil 's hair for her and always it amazed her how much yellow and brown and brass and carrot and chestnut there was in Sybil 's auburn hair , a spectrum of warm colors . As they were shaving her head , she tried to think of Bee , whose massive well - modeled head looked handsome that way . But she did not think she would look as strong and fine with her hair stolen . She had had no breakfast . They gave her a heavy sedative but they did not knock her out . They told her she would not really be conscious , but she was . She could hear the orderlies making jokes as they wheeled her to the operating room . She had been prepared for any horror . Anything except boredom . First Dr. Redding drilled on her skull . It did not hurt ; it was merely horrifying . She could feel the pressure , she could feel the bone giving way , she could hear the drill entering . Then she saw them take up a needle to insert something . She did not understand what it was , because she felt nothing . They seemed to be waiting for it to take effect , whatever it was , and she waited too in gasping anxiety until she caught a reference to "

Next they fitted a machine over her , what they referred to as a stereotactic machine , and they pounded it into her head with three sharp metal pins as if she were a wall they were attaching a can opener to . Tap , tap , tap . They seemed to be figuring out at what point they were going to zero in , as they put it . She felt faint and weird . She floated miles above her helpless body propped in green sheets and towels in a sort of operating chair , like a fancy dentist 's chair . They were using an x - ray machine . They spoke of target structures and Dr. Redding boasted , “
127491	127673	126163	126163	We	3690	” Terror cut through the veils of the drug like a needle penetrating the bone supposed to protect her fragile spongy brain . How much of her was crammed into that space ? Perhaps they could wipe out the memory of Claud by the slip of a needle . The brain was so dumb , not like the heart knocking on the breastbone loud and fluttery as a captured bird . It hid in its cage of bone , imagining itself safe . 281 She wanted to weep , to scream . But she was contained in a balloon way back up through her skull , perhaps floating out through the hole they had cut in her , floating out there above them , lighter than air . How patient they were to take so much of their valuable medical time deciding where to push in . How wonderful that they did not simply use a great big can opener and take off the top of her skull and scrape out the brains with a spoon . Some people ate brains . “
127681	127694	127697	127697	she	3721	” she said suddenly . Morgan 's eyes above the mask widened . “
127700	127701	127697	127697	she	3721	" “
127706	127712	127697	127697	she	3721	" the operating nurse said . "
127720	127725	127726	127726	We	3722	” Dr. Redding said . “
127773	129044	129047	129047	monster	3726	” Now they were looking at photographs , like those of the moon taken by astronauts . That unknown precious country of her brain . They had a dummy second machine , like the one sitting on her skull squatting like a mosquito about to draw blood , and they were fiddling with the dummy . She would have loved to try it out on them . Suddenly she thought that these men believed feeling itself a disease , something to be cut out like a rotten appendix . Cold , calculating , ambitious , believing themselves rational and superior , they chased the crouching female animal through the brain with a scalpel . From an early age she had been told that what she felt was unreal and did n't matter . Now they were about to place in her something that would rule her feelings like a thermostat . Time ... time . Yes , the surprise was the boredom . She could almost have slept , hunched there . The green masks of robbers covered their faces , but she could easily tell Dr. Redding from Dr. Morgan . Redding was brisk and in control and chipper . Morgan was prissy with worry , his every motion a bureaucratic procedure judged against inner or outer rules . Now a new object was presented , crowed over . The nurses crowded close to see . The new toy . It was a metal disk embossed like a coin , no bigger than a quarter , with tubes and a miniature dialysis bag attached . She would be 282 a walking monster with a little computer inside and a year 's supply of dope to keep her stupid . The whole thing would fit in the palm of her hand ; it would fit under the roof of her skull , perched cozily on the brain . Her head felt wrong as they put it in . Everything felt wrong . Maybe it would feel right again . They were closing with cement . A temporary measure . They said they wanted to monitor the reading for a month or two , they might want to change the chemical she was being fed from that dialysis bag . They kept their options open with a cement plug . Afterward she had a massive headache . Even her teeth seemed all to ache . She did not want to move . She did not care about anything . She lay in her bed and through half - closed eyes she ignored the patients and nurses passing on the neurology ward . After they moved her back to her own ward , for a week she lay numb and uncaring . Acker came and talked to her . He tried to get her to perform tests and answer questions , he brought his charts and what she always thought of as his children 's games . Why should she answer ? They were waiting for her to heal before they played with her , she felt . Skip , who was being a good patient , brought her food on a tray . Politely , he did not look at her , more nude than if her clothes had been taken away . Tina read her the newspaper , tried to start conversations . Sybil came in and sat patiently , let her alone and then returned , hoping . Tina 's voice , rising like an indignant wasp , buzzed at her . She could not want to talk . She could not care . She was a spoiled orange rotting green . The only person she cared to watch was Skip as he came and went , sweeping the ward and running errands for the attendants and the other patients . He was dressed in his street clothes and his hair had grown short and patchy . He looked younger and older than he had : younger in his angularity , his new awkwardness ; older in the wary lack of expression on his face . She felt his will all the time like a knife he was carrying concealed , and she envied him for retaining his will . She wondered , when she could bring herself to think at all , how he preserved the power of his will hidden inside . They had decided to operate next week on Alice . They felt they knew just what tissue in her brain to coagulate 283 now , where to burn a hole in what was called Alice . Then she would have her electrodes removed , they promised , just like Skip . They were tired of playing with Alice , who had become sullen and passive . At times she giggled a lot , she seemed drunk and slaphappy , sitting on the edge of her bed . Then she slumped into a blank depression . Skip now had grounds privileges . He went to the canteen and brought back doughnuts , danishes , candy bars , cigarettes for any of the patients who had the money . The doctors had their own coffeemaker near the meeting room , and even the patients were sometimes allowed to make coffee in the afternoon in the small kitchen the lower staff used . Dolly had come by to visit her right after her operation , but had not been allowed in . Dolly had deposited some more money for Connie . Connie pretended to order sweets from the canteen with the others . Remembering Luciente 's urging , she withdrew change for an order but then quietly told Skip not to bring her anything . Seventy - five cents at a time , she was accumulating capital for escape . That much energy remained to her . Wednesday Dr. Redding announced to Skip loudly , so that all the other patients could hear , that Skip was being granted a weekend furlough . He could go home to his parents from Friday night through Sunday afternoon . Dr. Redding rolled out the pronouncement with conscious drama , saying that if Skip proved he could handle himself , this was the first of many furloughs , the first step back into society . They were all to envy Skip ; they all did . The doctors were almost done with Skip , unless further surgery should prove necessary , a little phrase they added . Skip said he was grateful and he 'd show them he could handle a visit home . He drooped there , no longer graceful under his shorn hair that spoke of the barracks , of the army , and looking Redding in the eyes , he told him how good he was going to be , how he was their cured and grateful little boy . She felt a strange pang , like something plucked in her . Friday , as Skip was organizing himself to go home and waiting for his parents to come to collect him , she got up for the first time since her operation , except for walking to the bathroom and back , and put on her robe . Shaking , she tied the loose cord and stumbled off to the men 's side . · She sat down on Skip 's bed and waited for the dizziness 284 ; to clear . She was n't allowed to do that , but the attendants had n't appeared yet . Skip looked at her with bloodshot weary cautious eyes . “

129448	129897	129898	129898	Someone	4649	" As quickly as she could move on her heavy waterlogged legs , her dizzy body riding its private stormy weather , she lumbered back through the ward to her own bed . Sunday night Skip did not return . By Monday the rumor crept through the ward as fast as patient could whisper to patient . Sunday morning early , Skip had slit his throat with an electric knife in the kitchen of his par- 285 ents ' home . They had hidden the razor blades , the sleeping pills , the aspirin , but they had not thought of the electric carving knife . Sybil murmured to Connie that she had heard that his father had been angry at Dr. Redding and called him a quack . They felt it was unacceptable for the hospital to send Skip home to kill himself in their kitchen . She got up from her bed and moved wearily around the ward , with Sybil at her side . Drs . Redding and Morgan were right thinking they had cured Skip , she thought , fighting the tilting aisle . Before he had only been able to attempt suicide , cries for help carved on his body . They had cured him of fumbling , of indecision . They had taught him to act , they had taught him the value of a quick clean death . 286 Fifteen DHA ! You 're the sharpest piper I ever gaped ! The woman was propped on the bed surrounded by mirrors - mirrors on the ceiling , the back of the bed , and one side . Connie stood flatfooted in the center of the windowless room , staring . She had tried and tried to make contact with Luciente , but she had been unable to feel her presence all day . Finally , in a stubborn fury she had cast herself forward , demanding that Luciente receive her . The woman 's hair , stippled mauve and platinum , was arranged in an intricate tower of curls and small gewgaws , dripping pearls like a wedding headdress . She wore a long dress of slippery substance that changed color as she moved and emitted a tinkling sound ; it was slit away up the side and cut out here and there so that her breasts occasionally peeked out or her navel appeared and reappeared . When Connie had materialized , the woman had been lying back on a mound of ball - shaped pillows smoking a pipe and chewing what looked like orange marshmallows from a small bowl on the hairy coverlet . The room was air conditioned cool . "
129957	130070	129952	129952	you	3738	" She popped off the bed and stood facing Connie , 287 quivering with anger . They were about the same height and weight , although the woman was younger and her body seemed a cartoon of femininity , with a tiny waist , enormous sharp breasts that stuck out like the brassieres Connie herself had worn in the fifties — but the woman was not wearing a brassiere . Her stomach was flat but her hips and buttocks were oversized and audaciously curved . She looked as if she could hardly walk for the extravagance of her breasts and buttocks , her thighs that collided as she shuffled a few steps . “

130119	130191	130112	130112	you	3738	” She stomped to and fro on smallridiculously small - feet . She looked as if any minute she might fall over through imbalance , the small feet and tiny ankles and wrists , the tiny waist , the small head with the tower of Pisa on top . Somehow Connie had wound up in the wrong place . She had missed Mattapoisett and hit some other place in the future . “

133435	133553	133370	133370	She	3826	“ Like a viewing port ? There 's one in the lounge . And from the sun plaza you can look around . There 's glass on all sides . At first it made me terribly dizzy - I wanted to hold on . All that space . But I did n't let on . I did n't want them spitting about me being a dud and never saw the sun before . Of course I 'd never been in the sun . It scared me but I just made out like I been in the sun every day . I had a tan from my last re - op , so how could they tell anyhow ? ”

But even up on the sun plaza what 's to see except the sun and you can only look straight at that for a while before you begin to see funny , spots — maybe five or ten minutes . The sky 's nice when you get used to it — it 's that gorgeous pale gray color . Once in a while some real weather clouds . I can ride into them , really - they give me a boost . But if you gape too much , flacks think you 're lower . You have to pretend to take it for granite . "

133928	133938	133996	133996	Gildina	644	" But it does n't taste anything like ham . "

134060	134132	134046	134046	her	644	“ I know the richies eat queer things , sort of ... raw . Stuff from , you know , live things . They practically eat them alive . I ca n't suppose that 's good for you , our stomachs are n't made of Cybernall . I never had any of that ... strange stuff . You trying to tell me you had that richie food ? That live stuff ? ”
134133	134152	133996	133996	Gildina	644	" Sure . Poor people could n't buy a lot of it , but everybody had it sometimes . "
134153	134220	134042	134042	Gildina	644	" We got enough troubles . I got chronic colonic malachosis myself and Cash has ulceric tumors . I ca n't imagine how the richies survive . I heard they eat animal tissue even . The idea makes me dizzy . I mean except as a sexy idea . I mean I seen it on the Sense - all , but it does n't float me . ”
134221	134231	134232	134232	Gildina	644	" Well , where does your food come from ? ”
134235	134261	134232	134232	Gildina	644	“ Out in the Roughlands , big corporate factory - farms . They mine it , you subscribe , and it gets delivered every week . ”

134294	134302	134303	134303	Gildina	644	" How would I suppose on that ? "
134307	134342	134343	134343	She	644	“ It 's a service . All middle - flack plexes have platos . You take the clean stuff out and you put the dirty stuff in . Look , I 'll show you . ”

134424	134434	134353	134353	She	644	" A restaurant ? Like a place everybody eats ? ”
134439	134453	134436	134436	Gildina	644	“ But if I decide to do that I got to start prepping . "
134454	134462	134353	134353	She	644	“ What time does he get home ? ”
134463	134484	134353	134353	She	644	“ Not for two hours , but it takes that long , for display . The painting is what counts . "
134485	134493	134436	134436	Gildina	644	" You mean making up your face ? ”
134494	134556	134353	134353	She	644	“ No , leg painting . It costs a heart and a kidney , but if you try to do it yourself , you look like a joke . You have to go to a real artiste . There 's a fem on this floor who 'll do me even at the last minute . I 'll flash her a transie . "
134557	134565	134353	134353	She	644	“ How come she 'll do you ? ”
134566	134643	134436	134436	Gildina	644	" She owes me ... I know a few things about her . She skipped on a contract . She 's in the crazy slot , she even paints her walls , but she does a good job cheapo with no appoint . So I should turn her in to the organ banks ? It 's no silc off my ass ! They say the richies take the ones who are real good for the platforms . "
134644	134656	134353	134353	She	644	" Gildina , the richies — who are they , really ? ”
134657	134712	134713	134713	Gildina	644	" The same as in your time -- the Rockemellons , the Morganfords , the Duke - Ponts . They 're ancient . I mean some of them were alive in your time , I suppose , if you 're for real . Wait till Cash gapes you . He 'll figure it out . ”
134719	134731	134713	134713	Gildina	644	“ He 's had SC , did you suppose on that ? ”
134732	134737	134353	134353	She	644	“ What 's escee ? "
134738	134895	134353	134353	She	644	" Sharpened control , reallike . He 's been through mind control . He turns off fear and pain and fatigue and sleep , like he 's got a switch . He 's like a Cybo , almost ! He can control the fibers in his spinal cord , control his body 297 temperature . He 's a fighting machine , like they say . I mean not really like a Cybo , but as good as you can get without genetic engineering or organ replacement . He 's still a woolie — that 's what the richies and the Cybos call us , who are still animal tissue . But he 's real improved . He has those superneurotransmitters ready to be released in his brain that turn him into just about an Assassin . I mean not really , he 's fourth level , but he 's in that direction , if you gape . ”
134896	134920	134713	134713	Gildina	644	" Remember , I 'm just a dud from the past . They have n't told me a lot of this stuff yet . ”
134921	134960	134353	134353	She	644	“ Yeah , the Age of Uprisings and all that stuff . Before they automated the boondocks — the old UD countries , when they had all those useless animals and wild plants and dumb people and stuff . ”
134961	134967	134353	134353	She	644	" But who are Assassins ? ”
134968	134978	134979	134979	Gildina	644	" Sha ! You do n't talk about them . ”
134983	135016	134979	134979	Gildina	644	“ Of course we 're monitored like everybody else , so SG knows I 'm talking to you . So like if I 'm doing anything wrong , they 'll stop us . "
135017	135020	134353	134353	She	644	“ Monitored ? ”
135021	135166	135181	135181	He	933	" From the Securcenter here , what else ? For versive acts and talks . They pull you in and put a scanner on you so they can tell what you 're thinking to the questions , even if you do n't talk . From the etectrical impulses in your brain . You ca n't lie to them , unless you 're a trained SD man or an Assassin . Assassins work for the richies . That 's how they deal with each other when they 're at odds . Every richie clan and all the multies have armies of genetically engineered fighters . Instead of sex drive , they have a basic killer drive and obey center . You ca n't tell exactly what they are some are woolies genetically specialized . Some are real Cybos . No animal issue . Entirely improved . "
135264	135275	135248	135248	Luciente	309	" Who are you ? Remain still . Answer correctly . "
135277	135296	135248	135248	Luciente	309	“ My name is Connie and I 'm time traveling . I guess you were listening to us ? ”
135297	135321	135322	135323	the man	6075	“ There is no such thing as time travel . You will be scanned . And you will be sealed in here again , ”
135329	135351	135322	135323	the man	6075	“ We 'll deal with you later . She 's a dud , but you talked with her for one hour . ”
135357	135411	135352	135352	Gildina	644	“ Well , how could she get in here if you did n't let her ? I thought it was a special project . Everybody before the great split , they were all duds and woolies . Everybody knows that ! How could she get in if you did n't let her in ? ”
135412	135427	135428	135428	he	3844	“ That 's not your problem . You 're for the organ bank now , "
135441	135446	135428	135428	he	3844	“ You , come . ”
135457	135481	135447	135447	His	3844	“ I can only stay here through her . Gildina has a special mental power , even if she does n't know it . ”
135482	135546	135434	135434	his	3844	" Incorrect . She was born a dud . She 's just a built - up contracty . All duds have brain deficiencies from protein scarcity in fetus and early childhood . Their IRP 's are negative forty to negative fifteen . Her psych scan tests show negative twenty - five . She has no more mental capacity than a genetically improved ape . "
135549	135578	135434	135434	his	3844	" She 's still receptive . I guess you do n't measure that ! I homed in on her . Break my contact with her and I disappear . ”
135616	135637	135595	135595	he	3846	" When we get done playing with you , you will wish you could disappear . And then you will . ”
135651	135678	135595	135595	he	3846	“ She 's just a chica , exactly like you look to be . Cosmetically fixed for sex use . Like you find in any knockshop . "
135679	135685	135686	135686	Gildina	644	" How would you know ? ”
135696	135713	135688	135688	herself	644	“ What would you do in a knockshop ? You do n't even have the equipment . "
135714	135719	135720	135721	The guard	3847	" No appendix either . ”
135729	135794	135723	135723	his	3847	" That 's why we do n't need many of you useless cunts now - on . Nothing inessential . Pure , functional , reliable . We embody the ideal . We can be destroyed — not by you duds — but never verted , never deflected , never distracted . None of us has ever been disloyal to the multi that owns us . "
135799	135805	135796	135796	Connie	554	“ What 's a multi ? ”
135813	135819	135806	135806	He	3847	“ The multi is everything . "
135820	135829	135853	135853	Gildina	644	" What does ' multi ' stand for ? "
135830	135835	135836	135836	he	3847	" For what is , ”
135840	135846	135836	135836	he	3847	“ Like states , countries ? ”
135847	135852	135853	135853	Gildina	644	“ That was before , ”
135856	135860	135853	135853	Gildina	644	“ Multis own everybody “
135864	135869	135853	135853	Gildina	644	” the guard said . “
135911	135928	135931	135931	you	3847	" He bowed his head briefly . Then his head jerked upright , his eyes narrowed . "
135935	135955	135931	135931	you	3847	" She was trying to work her arm loose without success . His metal grip dug into her skin . “
135965	135966	135967	135967	My	0	” “
135991	135997	135984	135984	You	3847	" The hand squeezed harder . “
136062	136334	136054	136054	you	3847	” His other hand groped toward his belt . She decided she 'd better vanish . Shutting her eyes , she let go of Gildina and tried to shove off . But his grip still ate into her arm . Come on , come on ! She pushed with her mind , pushed against the metal grip . She fixed her mind on her own bed that she should ever call a hospital bed her own ! She thrust herself roughly back , and the grip began to fade . Dizzy , sweating from every pore , she lay on her back in bed . Sybil , Tina , and Valente were leaning over her . Her arm hurt . Her head ached horribly . She was being punished for the anger she had felt ; that thing in her head was punishing her with sharp pain and spurts of dulling drug . She felt her head was going to break open like a coconut struck with a hammer . She could feel the line where her skull was about to split . She would not answer them , but seeing she was conscious , Valente left . She winked at Sybil and Tina then , who stared at her , puzzled but relieved . Connie had to lie 300 back , breathe deeply , relax herself . So that was the other world that might come to be . That was Luciente 's war , and she was enlisted in it . 301 Sixteen LONNIE was an object . She went where placed and stayed there . She caught the phrase "
136337	136691	136692	136692	She	3855	" from Acker to his girlfriend Miss Moynihan . Exactly , she thought . You got it , Waggle - Beard - now run with it . She would not get up until gotten up . She ate only if fed . She sat in a chair when placed there and got up when hauled up . Although she was proud of time traveling on her own , she was afraid to try again . She did not want to end up in that other future . All the time the drug leaking into her head was clogging her , slowing her , and whenever she got angry , her head turned her off . Something hurt in her then ; a dreadful anxiety out of nowhere beset her with a small seizure and she had to remain still . Covertly she watched the ward and learned what she could about the hospital . She felt distanced from her own life , as if it had ended with the implantation of the dialytrode . She could not resume her life . Therefore Connie was no more . Yet she lived on . Detached , wakeful , brooding inside the heaviness of the drug , she kept still . She had given up smoking . For the first time in her life she stopped smoking . The craving for a cigarette was a left - over itch from being Connie . At least it kicked up sand on the desert of the hours , that old itch . 302 She could never guess when Dolly would appear . A couple of times her niece promised she was coming and never showed up , and then without warning she sailed in , bright as a parakeet , sharply dressed in something new with her hair that gaudy red , her sunglasses on , her hands wet with the perspiration of speed . The staff encouraged Dolly to come because Connie talked to her . Dolly slipped her money but would not bring Nita . When she asked about Nita , Dolly 's answers were vague . "
136704	136801	136802	136802	Dolly	305	" Nita 's birthday approached , the fifteenth of October . Connie begged Dolly to buy a present for her . Something preciosa . Pretty little slippers with bunnies , a soft animal with plush fur . Dolly promised , but Connie had no way to pin her down . The next time Dolly flashed in , she said Nita had had a lovely birthday . Mamá had given her a party with a cake with candles and ice cream . So Carmel still had Nita . Connie 's tongue spoke before she could stop herself . “
136866	136867	136847	136847	You	305	” "
136895	136896	136884	136884	they	3858	” “
136908	136909	136910	136910	Fíjate	317	" “
136935	136951	136912	136912	I	0	” Dolly kissed her cheek and pressed a wadded - up five into her palm . "
137032	137033	137025	137025	he	1037	” “
137047	137048	137049	137049	You	0	" “
137122	137126	137108	137109	the Arpege	348	” She pronounced it "
137129	137130	137108	137109	the Arpege	348	” “
137180	137181	137182	137182	Dolly	305	” “

137268	137273	137274	137274	I	0	” Dolly kissed her . “
137288	137798	137801	137802	Dr. Morgan	427	" Her arms where Dolly had splashed the cologne smelled like her old caseworker , Mrs. Polcari . One case unloaded . Maybe she had had a bit of a crush on Mrs. Polcari , at the same time that she resented her youth at the age they shared , her job , her money , her home , her children , her air of being gently but firmly at all times right . She felt sophisticated thinking so about her caseworker ; Luciente 's influence . Maybe she had wanted to eat Mrs. Polcari with a long spoon , like an ice cream sundae , a pineapple sundae with whipped cream and a cherry . Back in her life before they had made her their monster . Suppose they said she could trade lives ? But ' who would want hers ? Only somebody like Dr. Redding would buy her at auction , cheap by the dozen along with five thousand chimpanzees . Now she was a chimp who smelled of Arpege . Probably the cologne would be stolen . In spite of this being a locked ward , people went in and out all daydoctors and researchers besides the staff , orderlies and aides , volunteers who filtered through the whole hospital , students , graduate students , residents , interns , the chief resident , Argent 's assistant director of research , patients ' visitors , technicians , even a patient from another ward who flitted in to sputter quickly to Tina that she was dying of cancer but nobody would believe it . A clam in a green chair , she sat in the day room , unmoving , and all the gossip of the ward trickled through her sore mind . Somewhere in this fund of trivial bits of garbage smelling of rotting shrimp and brown lettuce must be some clue on how to find herself again , how to fight . She sat facing the bronze plaque on the wall that said the ward was named for Mrs. John Sturgiss Baylor . Baylor was Dr. Argent 's middle name . Actually it was his mother 's name , Valente said . His first wife was dead too , and his second , Elinor , was in her late thirties — a 304 hearty good - looking woman who seemed oddly transparent . Connie could never remember in between her appearances what she looked like . She seemed entirely beige and honeycolored and she would come marching rapidly through the ward for some momentary consultation with Dr. Argent , striding as if across a tennis court and looking at no one , cheerful enough and utterly indifferent to them all . She was the only wife who ever came into the hospital . She was on some committee that had to do with fund raising and managing volunteers . Finally at some point she began to speak to Dr. Redding when she encountered him , giving a measured smile , but she never greeted Dr. "

I 'd had a child at fifteen , live - born child of my own body , and saw my baby die of tularemia when they loosed the plagues on us . . . . Peony - Jackrabbit - was like wine to me . Did n't care for the right and wrong . I figured you grow through things . I can still remember being hungry as a child , always hungry .... What a pretty child person was - gawky , long - limbed , awkward , but coltish and gifted in giving joy . I had only three years of mothering 310 but years I loved . I did n't give dandruff if Peony was irresponsible . We were each comping Peony in opposing ways . No wonder person wept mad at naming . I was gobbling up every prank like candy and Arthur here was pushing the straight and narrow . ... "

What I want to tell is something two - no , three years ago . Now , you know my loving with Susan - B was not good . Never in balance . We all critted on that 311 and tried , but it never flew and always I felt unvalued in the end . Susan - B is gone now and I confess it 's easier for me with person living at Portsmouth . For a long time I could n't want to be loving with anyone , waiting for Susan - B to want to be as close to me as I wanted with per . A long saddening .

I had not taken a day free in months . I know Jackrabbit sensed my mood , for person could easily catch changes . Doors opening , doors closing . Everyone had eaten . We scraped leftovers and Jackrabbit came along to my space . . . . How easy and insinuating person could be . Without deciding to , still addressing Jackrabbit in my mind as if person were half a child , we ended up coupling that night . After , I felt for the old knot , and it was melted . Only the feeling I 'd been a great fool . I 'd scorned what was easy , the affection of my own family , for what I could n't have . Since then I have tried to be simpler , better . ... It was n't that Jackrabbit worked healer 's entrance , but person loosened the knot that pride kept tight . Once loosened , I could n't want to bind myself again . Even I had that much sense . ”

Jackrabbit was water , I could float . Jackrabbit was wine , making me tipsy and glad of the moment . We were always laughing . We never stopped flirting . Person was full of grace . Person made me want to know things that on my own I would never have grazed . Now , nothing ... "

But sometimes young people hold a strong sense of how it was , so that they stay in touch with the child inside and therefore with real children . Jackrabbit was so . Could enjoy children as people and want to work with them . 313 Find their ideas interesting , their visions real , their problems worth mulling . ... I worried about Jackrabbit 's wandering sexuality . Person knew of my mistrust and teased me . Ran circles around me . Now Jackrabbit is gone many more children will miss per than will speak of it tonight . I too will miss Jackrabbit ! A good strong holi is a powerful tool of learning . Many artists who make ceremonial and artistic holies , if they turn to making instructional holies at all , do so as in a lesser medium . Condescending . They simplify ... in the wrong dimensions . Children sense the falsity and turn away , bored . The holies Jackrabbit made for us we 'll use long past the lifetime that should have been pers . "

Damage to chest and organs was too extensive for us to save the life . We blocked pain . Jackrabbit died within fifteen minutes . We corded a last message . Should I play it ? "

Finish our holi with browns , reds , greens . Glim into uprush . Earth itself moving . Armies of trees . See ? Armies of trees . 314 .... Bee : bring Luciente through . Never got to mother . Mother for me . . . . Corolla : regret what will never fuse now . ... Orion : have faith in visions and patience with matter- "

We should have grasped at once the wounds were too severe . Otherwise we 'd have started cording sooner . We wasted time while we did n't want to admit Jackrabbit was dying . Our tardiness robbed many of you of a message . "

Connie stopped listening , catching Erzulia 's gaze on Bolivar , his dry narrowed eyes and brooding forehead . Rigid he sat with his legs crossed and his head at the top of the pole of spine slightly inclined . His eyes burned . His hands lay abandoned on his thighs like a pair of old kid gloves . Others were speaking their remembrances , recounting an episode , embarrassed or nostalgic . Otter said , “
142775	143208	142751	142751	Jackrabbit	377	” Diana and Erzulia conferred . Diana rose and came back with three women of her core . Lovers , sisters , daughters of the moon , they wore the knee - length white tunics of healers . Their hair was bound back and they bore as decoration the crescent of the moon . Now they carried 315 a cello , a flute , and a drum . After tuning up , they began to play , sitting to one side of Diana , who stood to sing ... or keen . Her voice began softly , sobbing , wordless but musical , used like a fourth instrument higher than the cello but lower than the flute . Her auburn hair fell over one shoulder . Tall and bony and commanding , she swayed . Her voice crooned , soared , ululated , wailed , and mourned over the rhythm of the drum . Finally Erzulia rose . She cast off her blue robe and stood in something like a dancer 's leotards , black against her black skin so at first Connie thought her naked . She stood still and then she seemed to grow taller .. She began to dance , but not as Connie had seen her dance the night of the feast . She did not dance in trance but consciously , and she did not dance as herself . She danced Jackrabbit . Yes , she became him . She was tall , bony but graceful , shambling and limber , young and awkward and beautiful , talented and bumbling , pressing off at once in four directions , hopping , leaping , charging , and bounding back . Bolivar 's head slowly lifted from his chest . He was staring . Suddenly Erzulia - Jackrabbit danced over and drew him up . Slowly , mechanically , as if hypnotized Bolivar began to dance with him / her . Erzulia possessed willfully by the memory of Jackrabbit led Bolivar round and round . He danced more feverishly , responding , his body became fluid and elegant as he had danced that night of the feast with Jackrabbit - that night she had spent with Bee . Slowly tears coursed down her own face , perhaps more for Skip than for Jackrabbit , perhaps for both , perhaps for old losses and him too and above all for Luciente and the pain tearing her . The music ended and Bolivar embraced Erzulia . They stood a moment clasped and then Erzulia 's body relaxed . Bolivar jumped back . “
143214	143219	143220	143220	You	0	” he cried out . "
143223	143266	143220	143220	You	0	" Erzulia lilted gently , wiping her forehead . Bolivar crumpled to the ground in a spasm of weeping so sudden that for a moment no one moved to support him . Then Bee and Crazy Horse gently held him , murmuring . “
143276	143345	143220	143220	You	0	" Erzulia signaled to the people who had served the coffee , and they began carrying around jugs of wine and glasses and picking up 316 the coffee mugs . This time they served everyone else first , to let the pitch of emotion ease among the close ones . The wine was strong , fiery , with a heady perfume of grape . The jugs were gallons marked "
143354	143520	143521	143521	Nobody	793	" and they passed around plenty of jugs . Enough to get everyone well drunk , she thought , noticing there were many other jugs waiting . In fact , the tension did seem to be lightening . People were chatting quietly , blowing noses , wiping tears , and putting handkerchiefs away , hugging and talking more . Bolivar sat down and cried in short but lessening spasms . His spine had relaxed . His face was crinkled . His head lay on the thigh of Crazy Horse . . Erzulia said something to the three musicians with Diana , and they began playing a different kind of tune , bittersweet , sweet and sour , it ran . Erzulia and Diana sang together , their voices turning and crossing in the air like swallows . Diana 's voice was deeper , Erzulia 's sweeter and more piercing . They twined and separated in easy counterpoint in the song Connie remembered from the nursery : “
143539	143576	143530	143530	Nobody	793	” That lullaby . Everybody began to sing it , they all seemed to know it . It made a slow wave of soft singing over which the voices of Erzulia and Diana rose and dipped . “
143587	143688	143530	143530	Nobody	793	" Te ' he children joined in , swaying back and forth as they sang words that seemed familiar to all , from babyhood , from mothering and caring for the young . The flute skipped off in a dance of its own high over the voices , and Erzulia and Diana fell back to listen . Other instruments joined in here and there in the hall . The improvising 317 rose in intensity , trailed off , seemed to stop , and then began again in a guitar or recorder . Finally the song dwindled . Barbarossa spoke thoughtfully . "

143795	143822	143787	143787	Jackrabbit	377	" Bolivar mused . He had stopped crying . His face was soft . He leaned on Bee , his head lolling like a sleepy child . "
144031	144036	144064	144064	they	4027	” Bolivar smiled weakly . “
144090	144191	144193	144193	He	4029	" just flashing at you as they undulate ever so slowly , fluttering across clearings . On their heads an Indian - chief headdress of brown- and black - tipped feathers 318 stands straight up when they want it to . We laughed so hard we fell off the donkeys . And they fluttered away slowly and tantalizingly , rebuking us for not having believed in them . Pooh ! Pooh ! they cried at us . Ah , the imagination of those ancient Cretans , Jackrabbit said , and for years that was a catch phrase between us . ... "
144198	144359	144193	144193	He	4029	“ We saw the work of a holist in Agios Nicolaus who fluttered us . Something ... fluid about per work . A top spectacler with eight students studying there . I could see Jackrabbit was tempted . That obsessed me jealous , for I viewed myself as Jackrabbit 's teacher as well as lover . I bound more jealous yet when Jackrabbit coupled with per . I had believed , I 'd wished , that Jackrabbit would also be drawn only to the male body - SO that we 'd be alike .... I remember those months so vividly , day by day . We were never closer . Yet the differences stuck out . Always I wanted Jackrabbit to be more like me than person was . ... That must have been a strength of your friending , Luciente , that you did n't want . per to be like you . That was almost unique for Jackrabbit . ”
144360	144365	144366	144366	Luciente	309	“ Ah , Bolivar ! ”
144373	144410	144371	144371	herself	309	" We each loved Jackrabbit and had great richness and great pleasure and now how we ring with pain . What more could we have asked ? Except that it last ! But what we had ... "
144561	144610	144611	144611	Luxembourg	464	" I remember one feast day — maybe it was Haymarket Martyrs or Halloween ? Jackrabbit helped me design a flimsy that was all dream . I was a luna moth , pale green 319 with yellow veins and a margin of layender , with plumy antennae . ... "
144614	144725	144611	144611	Luxembourg	464	" Up among the grapevines someone is playing the flute and the song calls my name . Among clusters of grapes half hidden by leaves like palms beckoning , someone waits whose mouth is sweet as ripe grapes , whose touch makes me bleed like ripe purple grapes in the press . I am in bed with somebody else . I was too jumpy . I 'm caught with the wrong person , the whole night to crawl through long as a tunnel to France . All over the hillside lovers couple . Here I am stuck with the wrong one while up among the grapevines you call my name . "
144806	144943	144802	144802	Luciente	309	“ I met Jackrabbit through Diana . Jackrabbit had retreated to the madhouse at Treefrog . I came to visit Diana , who kept teasing me and would n't sleep with me . Although Jackrabbit was staying in our village , I had n't got to know per well . All I had noticed was that person kept changing names , and that bumped me a little . Jackrabbit had gone down but by the time I came visiting , was integrated again . . . . Diana had a moon dance , on the grass there . It was green moon , the moon after the green equinox , and 320 at first I was comping jealous , Diana was fused with per mems and only watching me .

144972	144996	144997	144997	Diana	386	“ Not a complete going down . Basically Jackrabbit had come to feel taken over by Bolivar . Wanted to work with you , ”
145002	145104	145105	145105	She	386	“ but also to work alone . To be freer to grow as a person . You knew so much , you have traveled so much , you had worked out your own style , made a reputation . Jackrabbit felt as if per own work and visions were disappearing into yours — perhaps what was happening at Agios Nicolaus too . Jackrabbit lacked a center . Instead was an enormous uprush of vision and great hunger for experience . Balancing came from others . Needed someone to balance you . I also felt Luciente had been wholly sensible too long . "
145111	145120	145105	145105	She	386	" Yet we both saw through your plotting , ”

I am dreaming of a baby who drifts in the throbbing heart of the brooder growing every day more beautiful , closer to me . "
145262	145266	145267	145267	Erzulia	512	“ Sun up , ”
145280	145302	145267	145267	Erzulia	512	“ We have to give our loved friend to the 321 earth . The day here now . This wake over . ”
145341	145360	145361	145361	Erzulia	512	" Whoever wants a membrance from Jackrabbit , come and take one . Family and sweet friends first , ”
145380	145397	145374	145374	Luciente	309	" Jackrabbit used to say these . Every poem reminds me of times and times gone . "
145407	145419	145398	145398	Bolivar	476	“ I had a crafter make this when Jackrabbit turned fifteen . ”
145728	145853	145854	145854	Erzulia	512	“ Friends , we mourn for our comrade Jackrabbit , who died defending us . ' Only in us do the dead live . Water flows downhill through us . The sun cools in our bones . We are joined with all living in one singing web of energy , 322 - - - - - - - - In us live the dead who made us . In us live the children unborn . Breathing each other 's air , drinking each other 's water , eating each other 's flesh , we grow like a tree from the earth . ' Cast in the dirt and go . We must work on till we give our bodies back . Goodbye , Jackrabbit . ”
145957	145965	145966	145966	she	309	“ Now we go to the brooder , ”
146084	146106	146107	146107	Bee	378	“ We come to ask that a new baby be begun , to replace Jackrabbit , who is dead and buried , ”
146110	146117	146107	146107	Bee	378	“ I have news for you . ”
146130	146158	146118	146120	Sacco - Vanzetti	448	“ I have great news . That is , grasp , the council met . Decided to honor Jackrabbit . That genetic chance will be born again . "
146170	146193	146167	146167	Luciente	309	“ We thank the council . Though we will never know where or who , we know some part of Jackrabbit lives . "
146221	146231	146217	146217	she	309	“ What was that ? I do n't understand . ”
146232	146241	146242	146242	Luciente	309	" What ? ... Oh , the decision . ”
146246	146340	146242	146242	Luciente	309	“ Very rarely that is done . When somebody dies young who was unusually talented , as a kind of living memorial their exact genetic mix is given to a new baby . You never know , where . Nobody knows . Records are not kept . We 323 know nurture counts more heavily than genetics once you 've weeded out the negative genes , but still it is a memorial . It eases the mind strangely to know that a baby Jackrabbit will again be born somewhere , nine months from now . "
146341	146345	146401	146402	the nurse	4699	“ I suppose ... "
146346	146368	146369	146369	Luciente	309	“ I am too weary to send more , Connie , my sweetness . I must sleep . So must you . ”
146373	146377	146369	146369	Luciente	309	“ Let go . ”
146406	146425	146401	146402	the nurse	4699	" She 's coming around . Quick , tell Dr. Morgan . He 's sleeping down the hall . "
146569	146576	146577	146577	Redding	426	" That ought to settle it , ”
146648	146666	146641	146641	Connie	554	“ All right ! You were unconscious for twelve hours ! How can that be all right ? ”
146667	146706	146641	146641	Connie	554	“ Sybil , do n't worry ! Please . The only thing wrong with me is what they got stuck in my head . And I 'm doing what I can to get it out . Believe me . ”
146707	146712	146713	146713	Sybil	418	“ They 're frightened . ”
146719	146739	146713	146713	Sybil	418	“ They put off the implants scheduled for Monday , until they figure out what 's happening to you . "
146740	146756	146641	146641	Connie	554	“ Good ! That 's my first victory . Tina was scheduled for 324 Monday . ”
146915	146924	146925	146925	she	554	“ Too bad you did n't make it , "
146928	146932	146925	146925	she	554	“ Try again . ”
146933	146946	146907	146907	Connie	554	“ I only got four days . I 'm scheduled for Monday . ”
147167	147172	147158	147158	Luciente	309	" Where are we ? "
147173	147178	147179	147179	Luciente	309	" Near the front , ”
147182	147188	147179	147179	Luciente	309	“ We 've gone up . "
147189	147199	147158	147158	Luciente	309	" Is that why I could n't reach you ? ”
147200	147242	147158	147158	Luciente	309	“ Communing 's been harder . Something is interfering . Probability static ? Temporal vectors are only primitively grasped . . . . I tried to reach you before we shipped out , but since then I 've been too jammed . ”
147243	147249	147250	147250	She	508	" Where 's your kenner ? ”
147265	147299	147250	147250	She	508	" Back at the foco . We take them off for fear we 'll use them without thinking . They can home on the frequencies . We use these for locator - talkers . ”
147310	147341	147300	147300	Luciente	309	" I myself , I confess , I feel naked without my kenner . It 's part of my body . I only take it off to couple or sleep . ”
147342	147348	147423	147423	his	378	" Suppose it got lost ? ”
147349	147407	147408	147408	Bee	378	" I 'd lose two - thirds of my memory . ... Marigold at Treefrog had an accident in which both left arm and kenner were destroyed . Arm we could restore but not kenner . Marigold killed perself . . . . For some it 's only a convenience . For others part of their psyche . ”
147448	147474	147437	147437	His	378	“ G’light , Pepper and Salt . I forgot to tell you last time I believe you should trade that wig in on a porcupine . ”
147475	147488	147491	147491	she	4087	" It 's beginning to grow out . It kind of itches . ”
147594	147607	147585	147585	Bee	378	“ This ca n't be good . What have they in there ? ”
147608	147617	147618	147618	Bee	378	" Something to control me . A machine . ”
147634	147653	147618	147618	Bee	378	“ We 're all at war . You 're a prisoner of war . May you free yourself . ”
147666	147671	147659	147659	She	4087	“ How can I ? ”
147672	147679	147680	147680	Bee	378	" Can I give you tactics ? ”
147688	147748	147680	147680	Bee	378	“ There 's always a thing you can deny an oppressor , if only your allegiance . Your belief . Your Co - oping . Often even with vastly unequal power , you can find or force an opening to fight back . In your time many without power found ways to fight . Till that became a power . ”
147749	147762	147659	147659	She	4087	“ But you 're still fighting . It is n't over yet ! "
147763	147770	147771	147771	Luciente	309	" How is it ever over ? ”
147776	147798	147771	147771	Luciente	309	" In time the sun goes nova . Big bang . What else ? We renew , regenerate . Or die . ”
147799	147823	147824	147824	Luciente	309	“ But you do n't seem to believe really in more - not more people , more things , or even more money . "
147838	147932	147830	147830	her	309	“ Someday the gross repair will be done . The oceans will be balanced , the rivers flow clean , the wetlands and the forests flourish . There 'll be no more enemies . No Them and Us . We can quarrel joyously with each other about important matters of idea and art . The vestiges of old ways will fade . I ca n't know that timeany more than you can ultimately know us . We can only know what we can truly imagine . Finally what we see comes from ourselves . ”
147933	147945	147659	147659	She	4087	" Do you think I do n't know you , Luciente ? "
147946	148066	148067	148067	Luciente	309	“ Grasp , as people . I mean you ca n't fully comprend our society , any more than I could one a hundred years past us . What new arts will our great - great - grandchildren invent ? What old arts discover ? What musical instruments will they build ? What games ? What inknowing ? What new foods , what styles of cooking ? What sciences we ca n't imagine ? What new ways of healing ? Will they sail far into our galaxy ? Travel on the submicroscopic strata ? When each region is ownfed , when reparations are completed , what then ? Sometimes . . . sometimes I want 328 to live forever ! ”
148073	148142	148070	148070	her	309	“ But I know I 'll find my death ripe . I 'll want to lay my body down , I myself , and be done . But now I 'd like to travel forward into that future as you traveled to us . I know there 's no real point to it . Now suffices . Yet I 'm very glad to be knowing you , Connie . ”
148179	148184	148185	148185	Luciente	309	“ Fast ! Run ! ”
148274	148281	148282	148282	Bee	378	“ Run , Connie ! Run ! ”
148285	148299	148282	148282	Bee	378	“ Sonic sweeps kill . The reflectors are over the bridge . Run ! ”
148360	148367	148349	148349	She	309	“ Go on ! Save yourself ! "
148368	148382	148383	148383	She	309	“ There . Her eyelids fluttered . She 's coming out of it . "
148402	148414	148394	148395	An aide	4092	“ What were you trying to say when you came to ? ”
148420	148426	148415	148416	Nurse Roditis	665	" Something about going on . ”
148427	148433	148434	148434	She	309	“ I do n't know . ”
148439	148444	148434	148434	She	309	" Were you hallucinating ? "
148445	148455	148456	148456	Acker	431	" She does n't have a history of hallucination . "
148466	148493	148456	148456	Acker	431	" That injection worked . Dr. Morgan will be pleased . But I do n't know what they 're going to do if this keeps happening . ”
148576	148581	148582	148582	Luciente	309	“ Baffles and reflectors , ”
148586	148597	148582	148582	Luciente	309	“ Keep down ! They 'll be attacking our line . ”
148598	148603	148582	148582	Luciente	309	“ Where is everyone ? ”
148604	148626	148627	148627	Otter	395	“ We 're on the right flank . The line curves to our left , all the way to the river . ”
148700	148707	148708	148708	Otter	395	“ How does this touch you ? ”
148714	148736	148708	148708	Otter	395	" One leaf webbed gold with fawn fluttered to my feet and fragile as a dead moth 's wing was shattered . "
148780	148787	148777	148777	Connie	554	“ Is it a code message ? ”
148788	148805	148740	148740	Otter	395	" Code ? It 's a poem - a cinquain . You do n't like it ? "
148806	148818	148819	148819	Otter	395	“ But ... how can you write poems about leaves now ! "
148824	148851	148819	148819	Otter	395	" How not ? We 're close to death . Then it 's natural to write poems , no ? And we fall like leaves . ... "
148852	148857	148858	148858	Luciente	309	" Here they come , ”
149019	149024	149025	149025	Luciente	309	" Hold your fire , ”
149119	149124	149125	149125	Luciente	309	" Hold your fire , ”
149130	149141	149125	149125	Luciente	309	“ Pick off the ones that get through the barrage . ”
149152	149165	149143	149143	she	309	“ Forgive me , if you are living and I kill you . "
149178	149188	149175	149175	Otter	395	“ Do you suppose any of them are people ? ”
149516	149526	149511	149511	Martín	316	“ I think she 's coming to , Doctor . ”
149527	149544	149508	149508	They	5252	“ Patty , did you get hold of Redding ? Get on it . Find him . ”
149545	149558	149508	149508	They	5252	“ Doctor , his secretary says he 's on the way over . ”
149559	149572	149573	149574	Dr. Morgan	427	“ If we lose this implantation , it wo n't look good , ”
149577	149585	149573	149574	Dr. Morgan	427	“ When did she say he left ? "
149586	149593	149508	149508	They	5252	" Ten minutes ago , Doctor . ”
149595	149605	149573	149574	Dr. Morgan	427	“ Did she say he was driving straight uptown ? ”
149606	149614	149508	149508	They	5252	“ She did n't say , Doctor . ”
149615	149622	149623	149623	he	427	“ And you did n't ask , ”
149638	149644	149632	149632	somebody	5287	“ What about Dr. Argent ? ”
149645	149681	149573	149574	Dr. Morgan	427	" I could n't get hold of him , Doctor . He 's guest lecturer this morning at Dr. Sanderman 's pathology class . His secretary expects him in his office around eleven - thirty . ”
149683	149756	149760	149760	her	665	" She expects ! Why does n't she trot her ... self over there and give him the message . You call her back and tell her to step on it . She can speak to him as soon as he finishes the lecture . These women are too lazy to get off their chairs and stop powdering their noses . You tell her to hand - deliver that message to Argent . ”
149763	149776	149760	149760	her	665	“ Doctor , should I do something about an operating room downtown ? ”
149777	149855	149760	149760	her	665	" That has to be Redding 's decision . ... Where is he ? I bet he stopped with one of those university types for coffee . He drinks coffee all day long , it 's a medical miracle he has kidneys left . I drink it by the gallon when I 'm around him . If I keep it up , I 'll end up with ulcers like his . Where the bleeding hell is he ? "
149856	149878	149760	149760	her	665	" If you do want to operate , she had breakfast this morning , but she has n't taken anything since . ”
149889	149902	149903	149903	Hawk	539	“ Now do n't bite down , that 's a good girl . ”
150067	150079	150080	150080	He	378	“ How can anybody sing about fighting on such a night ? ”
150098	150116	150117	150117	Hawk	539	“ How good to fight beside you friend of our long table , mother of my child . ”
150185	150202	150203	150203	Hawk	539	" An army of lovers can not lose , an army of lovers can not lose ! ”
150268	150286	150262	150262	Luciente	309	“ Do n't start shooting clouds , sweetness ! Relax . Just enjoy the ride ! Whee ! ”
150287	150306	150262	150262	Luciente	309	" Enjoy ? My stomach sticks in my teeth ! Do we have to scoot along upside down ? ”
150308	150319	150320	150320	Hawk	539	" We 're like the sea gulls , winging along , "
150323	150332	150320	150320	Hawk	539	“ How can you not like to fly ? ”
150333	150341	150342	150342	Luciente	309	“ You moved this week , Hawk ? ”
150346	150410	150411	150411	She	309	" I turned over my old space to Poppy . It 's kid - sized , the bed and chairs are little . Poppy 's been waiting for space 333 for twomonth . Was planning to go to council for building supplies if something did n't break soon . But I 'm taking Jackrabbit 's old space , and Poppy can take mine . ”
150441	150517	150518	150518	she	309	“ My old space is great for a kid . Poppy 's ten . Near enough to the children 's house so you can run over when you want , if you do n't like spending the night alone sometimes . But the floater pad 's handier to where I 'm moving . I love the sound of the waters — I'm sorry ! You know what it 's like . I 'm so sorry , "
150523	150532	150518	150518	she	309	" Today we carry on Jackrabbit 's fight . ”
150556	150561	150562	150562	Luciente	309	" If we survive , "
150569	150595	150562	150562	Luciente	309	“ have you redded what you 'll do now you 're adult ? Bee said you 're dreaming on traveling . Will you apprentice yourself ? ”
150596	150647	150541	150541	Luciente	309	“ I 'd rather work with floaters than anything . But I want to travel awhile . Never hopped farther than the top of the bay . Thunderbolt and I 've chewed on taking off for some wandering after the current phase of the war is over , of course . "
150648	150658	150659	150659	Connie	554	" How do you know it 'll be over ? ”
150662	150670	150659	150659	Connie	554	“ Do you expect to win soon ? ”
150671	150679	150680	150680	Luciente	309	“ Win ? It comes in spurts . ”
150688	150693	150680	150680	Luciente	309	“ Like sun spots . "
150694	150769	150659	150659	Connie	554	" We thought we 'd go south . We figure we have a few useful skills to trade and we can always stiff it on any passing work . Bolt is a skilled pollinator . I 'm a good beginning mechanic . I do n't mean to wander forever , like those puffs . No family , no base , I 'd never get to fly . But I want to look around first . "
150770	150777	150778	150778	Luciente	309	" Forty degrees north of east , ”
150784	150800	150778	150778	Luciente	309	" Two hundred feet lower than present elevation . Dogfight . I count eight objects . ”
150898	150903	150904	150904	she	309	" Almost on them , ”
150922	150931	150904	150904	she	309	“ Safeties off . Let 's get them ! "
151798	151816	151794	151795	Dr. Redding	426	“ Right on the button . That does it . Okay , into the ambulance with her . "
152059	152067	152068	152068	she	4184	" I do think it helped me , "
152074	152085	152068	152068	she	4184	“ I feel much calmer . Those blackouts scared me . ”
152086	152120	152121	152121	Acker	431	“ Well , that wo n't happen again . We try one course of treatment , but we stand ready to switch to a better one if the first has unexpected side effects , ”
152137	152172	152173	152173	He	431	“ Sometimes a patient may express an allergy to penicillin . We have to use another antibiotic . Similarly , you proved to be , let 's say , allergic to the dialytrode . ... "
152190	152195	152196	152196	he	426	" Allergic , mm ? ”
152199	152207	152196	152196	he	426	" How 's our problem this morning ? ”
152209	152214	152215	152215	Connie	554	" I feel fine , ”
152219	152225	152215	152215	Connie	554	“ Ever so much better ! "
152247	152262	152263	152263	he	426	“ There 's evidence repeated stimulation of foci in the amygdala can produce results , ”
152266	152274	152263	152263	he	426	“ Still . . . probably temporary . "
152408	152428	152429	152429	Staff	1298	“ Oh , how my head hurts . Make them give me something ! Go to them and ask ! ”
152514	152521	152501	152501	Tina	581	" You 're doing much better , "

154085	154092	154093	154093	She	418	“ So what did you say ? "
154100	154126	154093	154093	She	418	" I said I was into this ward , although unwillingly . But I 'm interested in herbs and have done some healing with them . "

154141	154214	154138	154138	her	418	“ She told me lots of college students are interested in herbs . We discussed valerian , thyme , rosemary , comfrey . Finally she asked if I really was a witch , and when I assured her , she seemed quite pleased . She said several of her friends are ' into ' witchcraft . She said she 's trying to secure permission for one of her friends to meet me . ”

154231	154283	154138	154138	her	418	" No , Consuelo . She 'd read a herbal and cured a leg infection with lovage compresses . We had the most civilized conversation I 've had in ages . Except for yourself , of course . I was worried about you when they had that device in your head . ”
154284	154295	154296	154296	She	4266	“ Ah , I do n't know herbs from weeds . ”
154323	154358	154313	154313	She	4266	“ My grandmother knew weeds to heal with . But even my parents made fun of that . It was n't modern and scientific -like going in the hospital and dying of an infection ! "
154359	154420	154512	154512	Sybil	418	" Imagine , college girls studying witchcraft . She said there was a class in a women 's school . I never heard of such a thing . If only I could have attended college , Coni 342 suelo . . . I am self - educated . I wanted to go to school , wanted it a great deal . ”

They had to let her out for the holiday , they just had to . She did n't 344 give a wink for a stuffed bird ; they could stuff it with dollar bills and eat it with a sauce of Arpege . But she had to grasp the chance to run , before they operated on her . That one chance skinnier than a hair , than one of her own lost black hairs . For an hour and twenty minutes she stood on one foot and then the other , waiting for the telephone . She was sweating with fear it would be time to line up for evening meds before she ever got her hands on the telephone . Finally she dialed . Do n't let it be busy , she begged .

156525	156760	156474	156474	I	0	" He made fun of her all the time because he was n't afraid of her ; she was too small to scare him the way Sybil did and Alice had . For the EEG testing , she was taken off ward and up two floors . Always in the elevator her heart beat quickly and she imagined the opportunity of going down instead of going up , and out into the streets , whose gutters were full of the torrents of cold November rain . Miss Moynihan had made her leave her wig and purse behind , but she could still bolt if given a moment , a door . Miss Moynihan was going to use the second room , with the ten - track machine on her today . Connie was so used to the routine by now she sat docile as at a beauty parlor while Miss Moynihan combed apart what little hair she had and marked her targets , used the jelly and the tapo to glue the electrodes on , then slapped a gauze pad over . The wires led off to the chart on a machine near her head as she lay down and Miss Moynihan slid a rolled - up towel under her neck . Then Miss Moynihan turned the lights very dim . She had a patter she used that was supposed to relax the patients . “
156801	156843	156845	156845	your	4308	" Miss Moynihan sat outside the cubicle at the machine , whose ten pens scribbled away as the accordion piles of paper raced out from the face covered with dials . Miss Moynihan spoke in a carefully flat tone to her . “
156861	156951	156845	156845	your	4308	” As the pens rushed on , she wrote obscure notations that always made Connie terribly suspicious . She had her favorite fantasy as she lay there . Miss Moynihan would be called away . She would be called to the phone . A family emergency , Did she have a family ? Yes , patient gossip had it that her mother was dead , her father worked for the subway , her older brother was a building inspector , and her younger brother was still in school . ... "
156982	157056	157061	157062	Mrs. Ramos	340	” Miss Moynihan would be called to the phone and she would sit up at once , pull the electrodes off , and quietly walk past the two desks in the outer room , where some . times a woman sat and sometimes no one at all , turn right , and bolt down the stairway at the end of the hall . She could see herself doing that again and again ... , "
157071	157589	157590	157590	Lewis	341	” She would walk south to Harlem through the beautiful clean rain . Miss Moynihan 's father could not stand Acker , the patients said . Romeo and Juliet . A doomed romance . Miss Moynihan had beautiful soft gray eyes , in which everything seemed to dissolve . She bustled about , efficienı . hard , bouncy , but in her eyes chaos swirled . Connie decided Miss Moynihan was hoping to get pregnant . With so many beds in a hospital , it must be easy for them to make love . ... Miss Moynihan tapped on the machine , hard taps , as if she could read her mind . They tapped that way sometimes . She never understood why . Did Miss Moynihan think she was falling asleep ? Suppose she suddenly went over to Mattapoisett — what would Miss Moynihan 's machine show ? Was Luciente dead ? Why did she never feel her anymore ? It was the week before Thanksgiving . Captain Cream had had the final operation and sat about with a bandage on his head . He had to be drossed and he ate so slowly he drove Tony wild . He ate almost as much as Alice . Connie had the feeling , watching him , that he would go on eating all day at the same maddeningly slow rate as long as they stuck food in front of him . He would go on doing whatever he was started doing . If he was taken to the toilet , he would sit there until somebody remembered to fetch him off . Alice slumped in the lounge , withdrawn and creepy . Orville , with an implant , made jokes no one else found funny and giggled all day . Alvin called them the three stooges , but he did not seem to find that funny himself . Alvin was scheduled for surgery the next Monday , along with Miss Green . He would have been done already , but Dr. Redding had won his invitation to Dr. Argent 's hunting lodge , and took off a long weekend . Connie worked at being a model patient . She did jigsaw puzzles , she watched television , she entered alt con- 348 asked she got ped . She waike a prize per wig The Time versations , she asked advice and agreed , she kept her wig straight on her itchy scalp and tended it like a prize poodle . She volunteered and volunteered . She was ward housewife . Next time she asked she got permission easily to call her brother . · The line was longer , everyone with the same problem , whining , begging , trying to charm . Only one thought fizzled through the whole spacy line . When she got to the phone , the damn number was busy . By the time she got back near the head again , it was lights out . The next night , after an hour and ten minute wait , she got through . “

She despised herself for begging to be given the privilege of scrubbing Luis 's floors in Bound Brook . Claud would have stopped speaking to her if he 'd heard that conversation ; he 'd have taken off like a shot . But it is war , she thought . I am conducting undercover operations . I am behind enemy lines and I must wear a smiling mask . It is all right for me to beg and crawl and wheedle because I am at war . They will see how I forgive . That made her feel stronger .

Connie put on her old turquoise dress that fitted a little loose , and straightened the new wig on her head . Everybody was clucking and cooing over her except Sybil , who hung back , and Alice , who sat like a wrapped present in the hall , waiting . Sybil managed to catch Connie for a moment to whisper , “

158313	158747	158294	158294	I	0	” Luis 's house had an upstairs , a downstairs , and a level in between , most of it open space without doors or walls , like a big hospital ward . Rooms , rooms upon rooms . She was led up stairs covered with gold carpeting that must show dirt easily , to a room on the top floor . She had a bathroom all to herself , with a shower and a toilet and a wash basin and a mirror , a full - length mirror on the back of the door . She had not seen herself entire in months . The basin was like a vanity table , everything white with gold trim . The room had twin beds , and she felt dizzy at the thought of choosing one or the other . For a moment tears burned the inside of her eyes . She blinked . Why should a 350 bed make her cry ? For months she had not chosen anything . Luis dropped her little overnight bag on one bed , so she decided to sleep in the other . She felt relieved . So much space around her , it was almost frightening . It made her dizzy , it distracted her as if it were freedom instead of fancier imprisonment . The room had one window , covered with filmy blue curtains and white and gold Venetian blinds . Quickly she pried two of the slats apart to look out . Ay , too bad ! She stared down two stories onto a concrete paved area floodlit by a fixture high on the house . An outdoor fireplace was set into one side of the area , before the yard sloped away into shrubbery . No way out through this window . The yard was elegantly planted , with borders swooping in and out in drifts of pine and juniper , but in the night and the cold , it looked only bleak . The ground was frozen * and bare . Through the glare of light surrounding the house to protect it against burglars , she could not see whether the night was clear or cloudy . She hoped it would not snow . That would make it harder to get away . She wished that Luis had invited her out a few more times in the past so that she knew something of the area . Which way would she walk to get to public transportation ? She must figure that out . Without knocking , Adele opened the door . “
158769	159196	159208	159208	he	4335	” They were crazy , for they did just that : drank coffee from a blue and white electric percolator just before going to bed , along with a boughten apple pie . The pie tasted wonderful . She could have eaten the whole thing . A terrible desire to eat and eat and eat seized her throat . Food that had flavors . By shifting to the right in her chair she could see the refrigerator in the kitchen , huge and golden brown . It kept drawing her sleepy gaze , all that golden space crammed with food . She had seen it when she got out the nondairy creamer for their coffee . She had seen the turkey defrosting . The freezer was stacked with steaks and roasts and chops , with vegetables in bright cartons . She had seen gallons of milk , a pound of butter , vegetables in the crispers , salad dressings half used , real eggs , orange juice in cartons . She imagined herself rising slowly from her chair and with her Thorazine shuffle - she had been especially heavily doped that day in preparation for her 351 furlough — stumbling into the kitchen to the refrigerator , sitting down on the floor , and pulling out one item at a time until she had eaten everything in the whole golden box . It all called to her in wonderful soprano siren voices : the jar of olives , the chunky peanut butter , the salami , the liverwurst in the opened package , the jar of maraschino cherries , the cheddar cheese , the packaged dip , the bacon , the eggs , the chocolate pudding from the dairy case , the soda , the big round bright pieces of fruit . . They seemed to eat very quickly . Luis talked nonstop about his day . He spoke quickly and he talked a lot and he did n't like interruptions : in that he was like the brother she had had all her life . But this middle - aged overweight businessman in the dark gray suit and the wide tie with its narrow dim stripe , the round moon face bulging into jowls , the forehead that ran well back to the middle of his scalp , the fat fingers with a lodge ring that remained braced on the table as he talked as though he feared if he let go of them they would fly up - did she know him from someplace ? “

159250	159421	159422	159422	Luis	320	“ They 're worth twice that now . ' ' All covered with brown spots , ' he said . ‘ Listen , ' I said , ' I could have done the job with plastic . We have a beautiful selection of plastic . You wanted live ones . Now look , the world is full of diseases and bugs . You could 've signed up for my service . My boys come around every month regular as clockwork and they mop off the leaves and they exterminate and they put in the fertilizer . We keep it up . Something kicks off , we replace . It 's insurance . But you were n't interested . Now you complain to me that some pest has got into your greens . Of course some pest got in . What did you think you can put up a sign and say no insects allowed ? You do n't keep up an investment , it 's money down the drain . ' ”

161109	161170	161089	161089	Luis	320	“ Mark , you take more potatoes . That 's how come you 're so skinny . Makes you weak . That 's why you did n't make the football team .. Now , you try out for wrestling , listen to me - you can be skinny in wrestling . You wrestle in your own weight class , see ? "
161185	161213	161171	161171	Mark	702	" Now take Dolly . She does n't need to eat to get fat . She just looks at the potatoes and she gains weight , right ? ”
161214	161232	161089	161089	Luis	320	" I 'm not fat , Daddy . I 've lost all the weight I need to . "
161233	161268	161171	161171	Mark	702	" It wo n't last . It 's heredity . Look at your mother . If I did n't work as hard as I do , I 'd be as fat as she is . ”

161567	161603	161560	161560	Celeste	705	” Celeste jumped . She was happily swishing her candied sweet potatoes , cranberry relish , and broccoli into a multicolored mush , pressing it all together and sculpting it into castles with her fork . “
161606	161607	161560	161560	Celeste	705	” “
161636	161752	161753	161753	Susan	676	" . Adele blinked from her serene , faintly smiling cocoon . Connie watched her sideways , sure she was on something . No wonder Adele got on so well with Luis . She was hardly ever in the same room with him , no more than his fancy guppies swimming behind glass . She tended her two youngest with a casual smiling absentminded air , all the time off somewhere screwing seven - foot bronze angels on sunset clouds . She could not help speculating what Adele was on . Adele might just be incredibly stoned , but Connie did n't think so : she was too far off . Downers , most likely . "
161755	161766	161753	161753	Susan	676	” Adele focused on her baby in the high chair . “
161782	161783	161786	161786	Celeste	705	" "

161823	162013	161816	161816	You	705	” Her long thin hand laden with rings floated like a scarf through the air and sank to rest beside her scarcely touched plate . Dolly refused seconds , which Luis seductively tried to press on her , pretending he was only teasing . Mark was still toying with his first serving . The twelve - year - old Bob ate dark meat and more dark meat , steadily ignoring everybody . He was chubby and darker than anyone else except her , with small chin and black eyes , the Indian nose . Once when he cast a quick survey down the table , she flashed him a private smile ; his eyes widening with surprise , he smiled back . Mainly he seemed to be pretending nothing was real except him and the turkey . He raised a screen of strong protection between his father on his · right and himself . You will not hurt me ! You wo n't get through ! the screen said . Indeed , Luis seemed to sense the barrier and he pretty much left Bob alone . He tried once . “
162040	162052	162030	162030	You	0	” 357 But under repeated prodding , Bob would say only , “
162064	162266	162057	162057	He	4385	" Connie smiled again at her tough nephew , who went to an Italian parochial school and had a picture of Chavez on his wall . At the table were those wrestling with Luis and those like Bob , Adele , herself , who were noncombatants . Bob and she rivaled Luis in how much they ate and their pleasure in eating . Adele picked politely . She was patting the baby 's face with a napkin and cooing , while she floated in a sky - high hammock behind her eyes . After the pumpkin pie , the maple nut ice cream and the coffee , Luis herded them into the living room she had decorated under his supervision with pots of pink and yellow chrysanthemums , big spidery blooms as big as baby Susan 's head . Mark , Bob , Celeste and Mike galloped off to the family room one level down to watch TV , but Luis was serving drinks to the adults in the living room . Connie was excused to begin cleaning up . Dolly offered to help . Connie knew what kind of help she 'd be , but looked forward to the company . "
162269	162273	162274	162274	Connie	554	" Luis said . “
162299	162454	162297	162297	I	0	” Dolly glanced at her little jeweled watch , then at the numberless blob of clock on the wall that Connie could never read . Vic was to come and pick Dolly up to take her back to the city , once he got done having Thanksgiving dinner with his mother in a restaurant near Leisure World retirement community . Connie had run the glasses and dishes through the dishwasher and was just starting on the second sinkload of pots , when Dolly burst into the kitchen , weeping . Luis had been teasing her about how she had been talking about marrying Geraldo and nothing had happened . After Dolly had wept on Connie 's shoulder as so many , so countless many times before , blown her nose , and put her makeup back on layer by delicate layer in the small bathroom off the kitchen , she settled in a chair . “
162466	162471	162472	162472	I	0	” Dolly asked her . “
162482	162483	162486	162486	you	4390	” “

162618	162627	162606	162606	He	4392	” A moment later she was sniveling again . "
162660	162697	162698	162698	You	4394	" After Adele had put the little ones to bed , she wandered into the kitchen , where Connie and Dolly were putting the dishes away out of the dishwasher here and there , by chance . “
162707	162715	162698	162698	You	4394	” She was morose now , tense . “
162759	163138	163139	163139	You	4395	” She was talking to herself . She puttered around the kitchen in low - pitched sulky anger . Dolly giggled softly ; Adele appeared not to hear . We are not three women , Connie thought . We are ups and downs and heavy tranks meeting in the all - electric kitchen and bouncing off each other 's opaque sides like shiny pills colliding . She stuffed a ' bread knife into the hem of her dress and walked carefully upstairs , aware of its swinging and bumping . Again that night Luis locked her in . Lying stiffly on the bed , this time she heard him turn the key in the lock . She went through the empty drawers of the dresser , she went through the shelves of the medicine cabinet , finding aspirin , toothpaste , antiperspirant , shampoo , a room deodorizer . The bedroom window was closed with an air conditioner . The bathroom window opened a foot and a half after she worked on it with the knife for half an hour . Then she leaned out into that drop , two stories to concrete . No vines , no convenient fire escape , no porch or garage roof to drop to . She was still trapped . She worked on the doorjamb till she was drenched with sweat , but could not get the hall door open . Friday was a big workday and also her last full day outside the hospital . Saturday she was to clean in the morning and then be carried back to Manhattan well before the party . Friday morning she spent cooking dishes for Saturday 's buffet - three large cakes and two mousses for 359 dessert . At two o'clock Luis came home to fetch her , taking her off to his nursery and greenhouses . The other places were just retail outlets . Here she had worked three months for Luis , transplanting , spraying . Luis drove her over in his white Eldorado , which felt as big as the patient lounge . He had the radio on but after a while he shut it off to launch at her . She sighed and tried to dampen herself to endure . "
163165	163166	163153	163153	they	4396	” “
163180	163181	163175	163175	I	0	" “
163209	163213	163214	163214	I	0	" He chuckled . “

163275	163276	163261	163261	I	0	" “
163297	163503	163284	163284	you	341	” She was craning her neck , trying to figure out where they were and how near public transportation . Maybe at the nursery she could get away . She knew exactly how to get back to Manhattan from there ; she 'd done it every day for three months . She had slipped the money out of her purse , in case he took that from her , and secreted it in her bra , feeling like a spy , a secret agent . It was n't too comfortable . The stiff paper rubbed her breast . The nursery looked as it had when she 'd worked there , except it was winter now and much less stock stood outside in rows , only what they grew themselves . Most of the stock was shipped to them in spring from the South , from Ohio , even from Texas , brought in by truck . The greenhouses were full . Luis 's top man , Richie , and his secretary came running after him as soon as he stepped through the door . Luis turned her over to Gino , the sixty - year - old grizzled Italian who ran the greenhouses , saying , “
163839	163867	163837	163837	me	0	” Gino helped himself to a cough drop and said nothing . After Luis left , he squinted at her , asking in his hoarse · voice , “
163874	163875	163868	163868	You	4400	” "
163886	163887	163868	163868	You	4400	” "
163934	163947	163925	163925	We	4412	” He spat into a bright handkerchief that reminded her of Luciente . “
164023	164283	164011	164011	Yoy'll	711	" She picked out smart - looking plants , the ones with the shiniest leaves , the most graceful drooping foliage , the showiest flowers , the most exotic fruit . As best she could , she hauled them to the locked doors of the loading dock . A couple of times she had to yell for help , till Gino reluctantly assigned her five minutes from one of the other overworked , underpaid greenhouse employees . The pesticides had used to make her sick . She had worked long hours till her back ached and never stopped aching day 361 and night , and it had taken her so long to come and go on public transportation she had had no time to spend with her own child . All for two dollars an hour and bad headaches . The poisons could kill if she breathed them , if they only touched her skin . Even when she wore a face mask , they got to her . Snow was beginning , swirls of small flakes idling in the air and sticking in the crotches of bare trees in their rows outside . The only thing she could find was a smock of thin cotton , but she put that on . So she 'd catch a cold ! Her coat was locked up in Luis 's office , but she 'd go as she was . She moved slowly , ever so casually toward the door . But as she stepped outside , Richie called to her , "
164292	164807	164011	164011	Yoy'll	711	” Again and again she waited and made a move , but always Gino or Luis or Richie was watching . On impulse she walked back into the shed where poisons were stored . The cabinet was locked , but she looked behind the door and the key was still on its hook there . Like a joke , she had always thought , like having a safe and writing the combination on the wall . She unlocked the cabinet . A few of the poisons were new to her . There were the fungicides they used : zineb , Captan , sulfur . The pesticides : Sevin , malathion , Kelthane . Some came readymixed and some were powder or oil . Parathion : that was the most deadly in the nursery in the old days . Gino had warned her about wearing the gloves with all of them , but the girls told stories about people dying just from touching parathion . She had never used it . She was not allowed to . But she had seen Gino using that oil . She grabbed up a small bottle and filled it with the brown oil , her hand trembling . Slowly she poured it , holding her breath . Perhaps even coming this close might kill her , but then they were going to kill her anyhow . But this was a weapon , a powerful weapon that came from the same place as the electrodes and the Thorazine and the dialytrode . One of the weapons of the powerful , of those who controlled . Nobody was allowed to possess this poison without a license . She was stealing some of their power in this little bottle . She put the big container back where it had been , locked the cabinet ; then she thought better and opened it again and wiped everything with the hem of her dress . Fingerprints . Then she backed out , putting the bottle in the pocket of the smock , until she 362 should get a chance to put it in her old plastic purse . Quickly she went back to work , choosing plants . Her . hands kept trembling . She wondered if she was dying of poison . Perhaps the shaking of her hands was the first stage of poisoning . Perhaps handling the bottle could kill her . She felt the brown oil radiating a sinister influence all around it . Never had she done such a thing , grabbed at power , at a weapon . She did not intend to go Skip 's way . Yes , she had stolen a weapon . War , she thought again . She would fight back . But her hands trembled and trembled and she found her knees buckling till she could hardly focus on the plant before her , large and leathery , almost as big as herself , whose name she had forgotten . Supper consisted of leftovers . Adele toyed with her food , smiling again . "
164836	165606	164834	164834	Mummm	715	" Connie looked hard at Luis . When she went to the kitchen to fetch the coffee and dessert , she could pour some of the poison into the coffee . It was brown and oily . It would work well in coffee . For all the meanness he had laid on her all the years of her life , for Dolly , for Carmel . Her purse lay within reach . She could do it . Luis was laughing at his own joke , his head tilting way back . As he laughed , for a moment out of control , almost boyish , she saw in him that older brother she hated to remember she had adored . Up to the age of ten , she had adored Luis with her whole heart . He had seemed to her that prince , that peacock wonder he always remained to their mother . He could fight , he could talk his way in and out of trouble , he could speak English better than any of them , he could stand up for her if he wanted . Yes , Luis the street kid she had adored . Luis the young hoodlum had touched her heart and set a mold on it . Something of what she had loved in Martín , something of what she had loved in Claud : the grace , the anger , the sore pride , the refusal to swallow insult . The army had changed Luis . When he had come back , he had contempt for the rest of them . His anger and unruly pride had been channeled into a desire to get ahead , to grab money , to succeed like an Anglo . Who knew what being poor and being brown would have done to Martín if he had lived ? Perhaps he would 363 have hardened like Luis . She could not believe that of his tenderness , yet she could remember Luis at fourteen stealing a bright scarf from the dime store for her to wear Easter Sunday , laughing as he pulled it from the leather jacket no one knew how he had come by . How beautiful he had seemed , the glint of teeth in his brown face , his eyes burning with anger or joy , the arrogant overacted thrust of his shoulders . Jesús had been scared he would go bad , they would lose him to the streets . None of them had guessed they would lose him to the Anglos , entirely . After supper she steamed a label off a fancy herbal shampoo in the bathroom and pasted it on her bottle . When the bottle dried , the label stuck . She would take it back to the hospital with her alongside a shoebox of old cosmetics Adele gave her - lipsticks in frosted colors no longer fashionable , the wrong shade of eye shadow , a half - finished jar of cold cream containing oil of the palm . Adele also gave her a beige cardigan with embroidered flowers , shrunk in the wash , a pair of panty hose , and a pile of old Vogues and New Yorkers . It reminded her of the sort of things people gave you when you cleaned for them . She did not get to taste the dishes she had cooked for the party , but she discovered from the scale in the bathroom off the master bedroom that she had managed to gain four pounds from Wednesday night to Saturday noon . She did not mind . How I spent my vacation : I ate , As she sat in Luis 's big white Eldorado idling sluggishly through heavy traffic , she realized several weeks had passed since she 'd gone over . Was Luciente dead ? She could not bear to think so . She was the one who was dead . She could not catch anymore . She was hardening herself as Luis had done to himself , but not for money . To succeed in her war . To fight back . She closed her eyes and saw her weapon , disguised as shampoo . Nineteen I HAT Monday Acker announced that Alice and Captain Cream were to be released Friday to welfare hotels . Alvin was taken away to be operated on , along with Orville . Sybil , Miss Green , and Connie were given yet another battery of physical and psychological tests and scheduled for meetings with the doctors on Wednesday . "
165615	165634	164834	164834	Mummm	715	” Sybil said out of the side of her mouth as they stood in line for the meds . "
165643	165668	165640	165640	they	4419	” Connie said . She and Sybil waited for an opportunity to do their laundry at the same time . Then she asked Sybil , “

166144	166454	166455	166455	I	0	” Tuesday night , in spite of the sleeping pills she lay awake , her eyes wearing themselves raw on dim shapes . She tossed , she thrust her head into the pillow , she counted and tried to blank her mind . Her thoughts ran round and round like dogs trapped behind a fence , to and fro until they had worn a bald track in her head . She tried to open her mind to Luciente . In weary boredom , in fear of the next day , wanting a little something nice , she tried . Her mind was rusted shut . It would not open . She pushed on herself , she tried and tried . Sweat stood out on her forehead , sweat gathered under her arms and under her breasts . Once she almost felt something , a presence . That made her go on battering her mind . She lay panting as if she had run up a flight of steps . Please , she begged , please ! What had been so easy was hard and painful , hard as dying . Dying into distance . Where there had been only air , something solid stood , solid as bone , as prison walls . But she went on . What else did she have to 366 do this night ? What else but touch her fears like the beads of a cold , oily rosary , again and again . She ' went on trying . Finally she felt a brush of presence , hard , hard and heavy . Yet she could tell almost at once that this time the pain was coming from Luciente . No , the pain was from the terrible effort . Luciente too strained toward her . Together at last they forced weak contact . “

166521	166567	166516	166516	Zuli	511	” Finally , roughly , she stood shaking in the meetinghouse . As on the nights of the feast and of Jackrabbit 's wake , many people circulated , but dressed now in ordinary clothes . Their voices were subdued . Luciente hugged her tight . "

It 's one choice to breed carrots for our usesespecially leaving wild and variant gene pools intact . Is another to breed ourselves for some uses or imagined uses ! 367 For all we know , a new ice age comes and we might better breed for furriness than mathematical ability ! I speechify ! Pass it . ”

Bee was using a very small holi projector which produced one moment a box of a children 's breakfast cereal from her own time called Sweetee Pyes and the next an image of braceros picking lettuce . He looked at once so serious , frowning at the Sweetee Pyes and rumbling deep in his chest , and at the same time so fine , with the delicate tattoo 368 e was ee dodgine.my of the bee rippling on his arm , she lost track of what Luciente was telling her . Hawk came dodging toward them . She greeted Connie and then burst out , “

169696	169746	169689	169689	Patty	432	“ Connie , we understand that you 're frightened . Society is also afraid of you — with more reason , would n't you say ? This operation is less complicated than the one you underwent in October . Now , you agreed you 're better for that operation . ”
169757	169794	169747	169747	Redding	426	" You 'll be the better for this surgical procedure also . 373 Then , like Alice , you 'll be released . Surely you do n't want to spend your life in a mental institution ? ”
169795	169811	169650	169651	Dr. Redding	426	“ But last time I got better and they let me out without any operation ! ”
169812	169831	169689	169689	Patty	432	“ And here you are again . Are n't you ? Your brother ... what 's his name ? "

169850	169922	169837	169837	Patty	432	" Your brother ... er ... in New Jersey ... Mr. Comanchee ? .. has signed the permission . The procedure will be carried out Monday . In a month you 'll be released . Consider that , Connie , and you 'll realize your fears are as irrational and as much a part of the pattern of your illness behavior as your hostile episodes . Okay , let 's break ! "
169989	169995	169996	169996	he	629	“ They done with you ? ”

170130	170139	170140	170140	she	554	" They said I could have some coffee , ”
170242	170278	170389	170389	she	729	" Come on , Ramos . They 're done with you . Leave the doctors ' coffee alone , do n't mess up now . You can get a cup on the patients ' side . "
170279	170287	170288	170288	She	554	“ They do n't want me anymore ? ”
170292	170379	170380	170380	CK	729	“ What do you think , they need all day to make up their minds about you ? They 're big - shot doctors . That Redding , he had his picture in Time . Patty showed me , she keeps a scrapbook on him . Dr. Argent , he goes up to Washington to testify before Congress to set them straight on things . You do n't think they got all ' day to waste making up their minds about what to do with you ! ”
170397	170404	170405	170405	she	729	“ I just killed six people , ”
170424	170475	170405	170405	she	729	“ I murdered them dead . Because they are the violence - prone . Theirs is the money and the power , theirs the poisons that slow the mind and dull the heart . Theirs are the powers of life and death I killed them . Because it is war . "
170500	170590	170476	170476	Her	729	“ I 'm a dead woman now too . I know it . But I did fight them . I 'm not ashamed . I tried . She broke the bottle under running water without touching it and washed the pieces down the shower . They 'd most likely find them , but it was the best she could think up . Then she washed her hands a last time and went in search of Sybil . When she found her in the lounge she said to her only , “
170593	171624	170476	170476	Her	729	" Sybil looked into her face . A tear formed and hung in her eye . Then she looked down and said nothing , alert , ingathered , ready . Connie went to her room . As she passed Valente , knitting , the attendant nodded to her . She thought of Luciente , but she could no longer reach over . She could no longer catch . She had annealed her mind and she was not a receptive woman . She had hardened . But she thought of Mattapoisett . For Skip , for Alice , for Tina , for Captain Cream and Orville , for Claud , for you who will be born from my best hopes , to you I dedicate my act of war . At least once I fought and won . After a while she heard the commotion and they came with stretchers - four . Dr. Morgan was trying to cut down 375 on coffee , and Miss Moynihan was being sick in the staff bathroom . I am not sorry , she thougni , her heart pounding terribly , and she sat on her bed , waiting . 376 Twenty Excerpts from the Official History of Consuelo Camacho Ramos State of New York - Department of Mental Hygiene Bellevue Hospital CLINICAL SUMMARY IDENTIFICATION : This 35 - year - old Mexican - American Catholic woman separated from her husband Edward for the past three years has one child , Angelina , aged 4 .
