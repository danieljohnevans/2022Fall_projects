581	969	1381	1381	she	200	" taming ' of Shirley Keeldar seemed genuinely perverse , as was , though less so , Jane Eyre 's marriage to a maimed Rochester;2 in Villette ( 1853 ) Charlotte Bronte threw the challenge of an ending back at readers . Kate Chopin 's Edna Pontellier drowns herself , a fatality of a raised consciousness with nowhere to go.3 More contemporarily , we project Sylvia Plath 's own destiny onto The Bell Jar ( 1971 ) , and even without it , there are conclusions Esther Greenwood never draws that bode ominously for her conclusion . Doris Lessing 's Kate Brown of The Summer Before the Dark ( 1973 ) can only take her knowledge back home where she started and stop dyeing her hair . Marge Piercy 's Small Changes ( 1973 ) ends when Miriam is about to be catapulted out of her smug marriage . Toni Morrison 's Sula ( 1973 ) squanders her intelligence and rebellion in casual sex , and spectacularly dies , it seems , of unrequited love . The heroine of Lisa Alther 's Kinflicks ( 1976 ) , which Lessing has compared to Fielding 's Tom Jones ( 1749 ) , ends ( unlike Tom Jones ) impoverished , outcast , optimistic but again with nowhere to go . Well , why ? I think part of the answer is that the mainstream , or mundane , as I believe we are now to call it ( distinguished from lunar , do you think ? ) novel , as a form , demands the individual solution , or failing that , the individual defeat . The feminist novel is , like the Marxist novel , difficult to envision for that reason : the solution is , by definition , not individual ; certainly a denouement of growing political awareness and subsequent activity would be hard to make effective . If the individual solution wo n't work , and the political solution is not describable in novelistic terms , the writer is left with a pessimistic conclusion . ( I think black mainstream novelists have faced a similar dilemma , as have writers of non - exploitative fiction about Lesbians and gay men . ) Joanna Russ has herself written about this problem in a Introduction vii brilliant essay , "
982	1197	1381	1381	she	200	" : ... one of the things that handicaps women writers in our — and every other - culture is that there are so very few stories in which women can figure as protagonists . Culture is male . This does not mean that every man in Western ( or Eastern ) society can do exactly as he pleases , or that every man creates the culture solus , or that every man is luckier or more privileged than every woman . What it does mean ( among other things ) is that the society we live in , like all other historical societies , is a patriarchy . And patriarchies imagine or picture themselves from the male point of view . There is a female culture , but it is an underground , unofficial , minor culture occupying a small corner of what we think of officially as possible human experience . Both men and women in our culture conceive the culture from a single point of view — the male . Now writers , as I have said , do not make up their stories out of whole cloth ; they are pretty much restricted to the attitudes , the beliefs , the expectations , and above all the plots , that are "

1205	1346	1347	1347	Russ	200	" being what Aristotle called mythos ; and in fact it is probably most accurate to call these plot - patterns myths . They are dramatic embodiments of what a culture believes to be true - or what it is mortally afraid may be true . Novels , especially , depend upon what central action can be imagined as being performed by the protagonist ( or protagonists)—i.e . , what can a central character do in a book ? An examination of English literature , or Western literature ( or Eastern literature , for that matter ) reveals that of all the possible actions people can do in fiction , very few can be done by women . Our literature is not about women . It is not about women and men equally . It is by and about men . “

Every choice begets at least two worlds of possibility , that is , one in which you do and one in which you do n't ; or very likely many more , one in which you do quickly , one in which you do slowly , one in which you do n't , but hesitate , one in which you hesitate and frown , one in which you hesitate and sneeze , and so on . To carry this line of argument further , there must be an infinite number of possible universes ( such is the fecundity of God ) for there is no reason to imagine Nature as prejudiced in favor of human action . Every displacement of every molecule , every change in orbit of every electron , every quantum of light that strikes here and not there each of these must somewhere have its alternative . It 's possible , too , that there is no such thing as one clear line or strand of probability , and that we live on a sort of twisted braid , blurring from one to the other without even knowing it , as long as we keep within the limits of a set of variations that really make no difference to us . Thus the paradox of time travel ceases to exist , for the Past one visits is never one 's own Past but always somebody else 's ; or rather , one 's visit to the Past instantly creates another Present ( one in which the visit has already happened ) and what you visit is the Past belonging to that Present — an entirely different matter from your own Past . And with each decision you make ( back there in the Past ) that new probable universe itself branches , creating simultaneously a new Past and a new Present , or to put it plainly , a new universe . And when you come back to your own Present , you alone know what the other Past was like and what you did there . Thus it is probable what Whileaway — a name for the Earth ten centuries from now , but not our Earth , if you follow me will find itself not at all affected by this sortie into somebody else 's past . And vice versa , of course . The two might as well be independent worlds . Whileaway , you may gather , is in the future . But not our future . the per from maker hom youing happened in the corne Vink the I saw Jeannine shortly afterward , in a cocktail lounge where I had gone to watch Janet Evason on television ( I do n't have a set ) . Jeannine looked very much out of place ; I sat next to her and she confided in me : "
14125	14201	13580	13583	the tractor - driver	1052	” I ca n't imagine how she got there , except by accident . She looked as if she were dressed up for a costume film , sitting in the shadow with her snood and her wedgies , a long - limbed , coltish girl in clothes a little too small for her . Fashion ( it seems ) is recovering very leisurely from the Great Depression . Not here and now , of course . “
14208	14224	14202	14202	I	0	" whispered Jeannine Dadier again , rather anxiously . She was fidgeting . She said , "
14233	14245	14225	14225	I	0	" She poked the red , turfed leather on the seat . “
14248	14252	14225	14225	I	0	” I said . "
14259	14266	14253	14253	I	0	” she said big - eyed . “
14277	14318	14270	14270	I	0	" I know it 's supposed to be virtuous to run healthily through fields of flowers , but I like bars , hotels , air - conditioning , good restaurants , and jet transport , and I told her so . “
14321	14566	14270	14270	I	0	” she said . Janet Evason came on the television . It was only a still picture . Then we had the news from Cambodia , Laos , Michigan State , Lake Canandaigua ( pollution ) , and the spinning globe of the world in full color with its seventeen man - made satellites going around it . The color was awful . I 've been inside a television studio before : the gallery running around the sides of the barn , every inch of the roof covered with lights , so that the little woman - child with the wee voice can pout over an oven or a sink . Then Janet Evason came on with that blobby look people have on the tube . She moved carefully and looked at everything with interest . She was well dressed ( in a suit ) . The host or M.C. or whateveryou - call - him shook hands with her and then everybody shook hands with everybody else , like a French wedding or an early silent movie . He was dressed in a suit . Some one guided her to a seat and she smiled and nodded in the exaggerated way you do when you 're not sure of doing the right thing . She looked around and shaded her eyes against the lights . Then she spoke . ( The first thing said by the second man ever to visit Whileaway was , “
14573	14594	14569	14571	all the men	1071	” Janet Evason , appearing in the Pentagon , hands in her pockets , feet planted far apart , said , “
14603	15125	15126	15126	he	1073	" ) the exarded her to movie . And The sound in the television set conked out for a moment and then Jeannine Dadier was gone ; she did n't disappear , she just was n't there any more . Janet Evason got up , shook hands again , looked around her , questioned with her eyes , pantomimed comprehension , nodded , and walked out of camera range . They never did show you the government guards . I heard it another time and this is how it went : MC : How do you like it here , Miss Evason ? JE ( looks around the studio , confused ): It 's too hot . MC : I mean how do you like it on — well , on Earth ? JE : But I live on the earth . ( Her attention is a little strained here . ) MC : Perhaps you had better explain what you mean by that — I mean the existence of different probabilities and so on — you were talking about that before . JE : It 's in the newspapers . MC : But Miss Evason , if you could , please explain it for the people who are watching the program . JE : Let them read . Ca n't they read ? ( There was a moment 's silence . Then the M.C. spoke . ) MC : Our social scientists as well as our physicists tell us they 've had to revise a great deal of theory in light of the information brought by our fair visitor from another world . There have been no men on Whileaway for at least eight centuries — I do n't mean no human beings , of course , but no men — and this society , run entirely by women , has naturally attracted a great deal of attention since the appearance last week of its representative and its first ambassador , the lady on my left here . Janet Evason , can you tell us how you think your society on Whileaway will react to the reappearance of men from Earth – I mean our present - day Earth , of course after an isolation of eight hundred years ? JE ( She jumped at this one ; probably because it was the first question she could understand ): Nine hundred years . What men ? MC : What men ? Surely you expect men from our society to visit Whiteaway , JĖ : Why ? MC : For information , trade , ah - cultural contact , surely . ( laughter ) I 'm afraid you 're making it rather difficult for me , Miss Evason . When themah — the plague you spoke of killed the men on Whileaway , were n't they missed ? Were n't families broken up ? Did n't the whole pattern of life change ? JE ( slowly ): I suppose people always miss what they are used to . Yes , they were missed . Even a whole set of words , like “
15128	15129	15130	15131	man ”	2713	” “
15131	15489	15126	15126	he	1073	” and so on - these are banned . Then the second generation , they use them to be daring , among themselves , and the third generation does n't , to be polite , and by the fourth , who cares ? Who remembers ? MC : But surely — that is JE : Excuse me , perhaps I 'm mistaking what you intend to say as this language we 're speaking is only a hobby of mine , I am not as fluent as I would wish . What we speak is a pan - Russian even the Russians would not understand ; it would be like Middle English to you , only vice - versa . MC : I see . But to get back to the questionJB : Yes . MC ( A hard position to be in , between the authorities and this strange personage who is wrapped in ignorance like a savage chief : expressionless , attentive , possibly civilized , completely unknowing . He finally said ): Do n't you want men to return to Whileaway , Miss Evason ? JE : Why ? MC : One sex is half a species , Miss Evason . I am quoting ( and he cited a famous anthropologist ) . Do you want to banish sex from Whileaway ? JE ( with massive dignity and complete naturalness ): Huh ? MC : I said : Do you want to banish sex from Whileaway ? Sex , family , love , erotic attraction - call it what you like we all know that your people are competent and intelligent individuals , but do you think that 's enough ? Surely you have the intellectual knowledge of biology in other species to know what I 'm talking about . JE : I 'm married . I have two children . What the devil do you mean ? 10 MC : -Miss Evason - we - well , we know you form what you call marriages , Miss Evason , that you reckon the descent of your children through both partners and that you even have "
15490	15661	15130	15131	man ”	2713	tribes”—I'm calling them what Sir - calls them ; I know the translation is n't perfect - and we know that these marriages or tribes form very good institutions for the economic support of the children and for some sort of genetic mixing , though I confess you 're way beyond us in the biological sciences . But , Miss Evason , I am not talking about economic institutions or even affectionate ones . Of course the mothers of Whileaway love their children ; nobody doubts that . And of course they have affection for each other ; nobody doubts that , either . But there is more , much , much more I am talking about sexual love . JE ( enlightened ): Oh ! You mean copulation . MC : Yes . JE : And you say we do n't have that ? MC : Yes . JE : How foolish of you . Of course we do . MC : Ah ? ( He wants to say , “
15667	15761	15130	15131	man ”	2713	" ) JE : With each other . Allow me to explain . s much doubts ourse they heir childreof She was cut off instantly by a commercial poetically describing the joys of unsliced bread . They shrugged ( out of camera range ) . It would n't even have gotten that far if Janet had not insisted on attaching a touch - me - not to the replay system . It was a live broadcast , four seconds ' lag . I begin to like her more and more . She said , "
15787	15827	15773	15773	you	1074	" In Jeannine Dadier 's world , she was ( would be ) asked by a lady commentator : How do the women of Whileaway do their hair ? JE : They back it off with clam shells . VIII "
15832	16280	15126	15126	he	1073	” exclaimed the philosopher Dunyasha Bernadetteson ( A.C. 344_426 ) who suffered all her life from the slip of a genetic surgeon 's hand which had given her one mother 's jaw and the other mother 's teeth - orthodontia is hardly ever necessary on Whileaway . Her daughter 's teeth , however , were perfect . Plague came to Whileaway in P.C. 17 ( Preceding Catastrophe ) and ended in A.C. 03 , with half the population dead ; it had started so slowly that no one knew about it until it was too late . It attacked males only . Earth had been completely re - formed during the Golden Age ( P.C. 300 - ca . P.C. 180 ) and natural conditions presented considerably less difficulty than they might have during a similar catastrophe a millennium or so earlier . At the time of The Despair ( as it was popularly called ) , Whileaway had two continents , called simply North and South Continents , and a great many ideal bays or anchorages in the coastline . Severe climatic conditions did not prevail below 72 ° S and 68 ° N latitude . Conventional water traffic , at the time of the Catastrophe , was employed almost exclusively for freight , passenger traffic using the smaller and more flexibly routed hovercraft . Houses were self - contained , with portable power sources , fuel - alcohol motors or solar cells replacing the earlier centralized power . The later invention of practical matter - antimatter reactors ( K. Ansky , A.C. 239 ) produced great optimism for a decade or so , but these devices proved to be too bulky for private use . Katharina Lucyson Ansky ( A.C. 201- 282 ) was also responsible for the principles that made genetic surgery possible . ( The merging of ova had been practiced for the previous century and a half . ) Animal life had become so scarce before the Golden Age that many species were re - invented by enthusiasts of the Ansky Period ; in A.C. 280 there was an outbreak of coneys in Newland ( an island off the neck 12 of North Continent ) , a pandemic not without historical precedent . By A.C. 492 , through the brilliant agitation of the great Betty Bettinason Murano ( A.C. 453 - A.C. 502 ) Terran . colonies were re - established on Mars , Ganymede , and in the Asteroids , the Selenic League assisting according to the Treaty of Mare Tenebrum ( A.C. 240 ) . Asked what she expected to find in space , Betty Murano made the immortal quip , “
16283	16692	15126	15126	he	1073	" By the third century A.C. intelligence was a controllable , heritable factor , though aptitudes and interests continued to elude the surgeons and intelligence itself could be raised only grossly . By the fifth century , clan organization had reached its present complex state and the re - cycling of phosphorus was almost completely successful ; by the seventh century Jovian mining made it possible to replace a largely glass - and - ceramics technology with some metals ( which were also re - cycled ) and for the third time in four hundred years ( fashions are sometimes cyclic too ) duelling became a serious social nuisance . Several local Guilds Councils voted that a successful duellist must undergo the penalty of an accidental murderer and bear a child to replace the life lost , but the solution was too simple - minded to become popular . There was the age of both parties to consider , for example . By the beginning of the ninth century A.C. the induction helmet was a practical possibility , industry was being drastically altered , and the Selenic League had finally outproduced South Continent in kg protein / person / annum . In 913 A.C. an obscure and discontented descendant of Katy Ansky put together various items of mathematical knowledge and thus discovered — or invented — probability mechanics . In the time of Jesus of Nazareth , dear reader , there were no motor - cars . I still walk , though , some times . That is , a prudent ecologist makes things work as nearly perfectly as they can by themselves , but you also keep the kerosene lantern in the bar just in case , and usually a debate about keeping a horse ends up with the decision that it 's too much trouble , so you let the horse go ; but the Conservation Point at La Jolla keeps horses . We would n't recognize them . The induction hel- 13 met makes it possible for one workwoman to have not only the brute force but also the flexibility and control of thousands ; it 's turning Whileawayan industry upside down . Most people walk on Whileaway ( of course , their feet are perfect ) . They make haste in odd ways sometimes . In the early days it was enough just to keep alive and keep the children coming . Now they say “
16701	17508	15126	15126	he	1073	" and they still walk . Maybe they like it . Probability mechanics offers the possibility - by looping into another continuum , exactly chosen- of teleportation . Chilia Ysayeson Belin lives in Italian ruins ( I think this is part of the Vittore Emmanuele monument , though I do n't know how it got to Newland ) and she 's sentimental about it ; how can one add indoor plumbing discreetly without an unconscionable amount of work ? Her mother , Ysaye , lives in a cave ( the Ysaye who put together the theory of probability mechanics ) . Pre - fabs take only two days to get and no time at all to set up . There are eighteen Belins and twenty - three Moujkis ( Ysaye 's family ; I stayed with both ) . Whileaway does n't have true cities . And of course , the tail of a culture is several centuries behind the head . Whileaway is so pastoral that at times one wonders whether the ultimate sophistication may not take us all back to a kind of pre - Paleolithic dawn age , a garden without any artifacts except for what we would call miracles . A Moujki invented non - disposable food containers in her spare time in A.C. 904 because the idea fascinated her ; people have been killed for less . Meanwhile , the ecological housekeeping is enormous . JE : I bore my child at thirty ; we all do . It 's a vacation . Almost five years . The baby rooms are full of people reading , painting , singing , as much as they can , to the children , with the children , over the children . ... Like 14 the ancient Chinese custom of the three - years ' mouring , an hiatus at just the right time . There has been no leisure at all before and there will be so little afteranything I do , you understand , I mean really do I must ground thoroughly in those five years . One works with feverish haste . . . . At sixty I will get a sedentary job and have some time for myself again . COMMENTATOR : And this is considered enough , in Whileaway ? JE : My God , no . Jeannine dawdles . She always hates to get out of bed . She would lie on her side and look at the ailanthus tree until her back began to ache ; then she would turn over , hidden in the veils of the leaves , and fall asleep . Tag - ends of dreams till she lay in bed like a puddle and the cat would climb over her . On workdays Jeannine got up early in a kind of waking nightmare : feeling horrid , stumbling to the hall bathroom with sleep all over her . Coffee made her sick . She could n't sit in the armchair , or drop her slippers , or bend , or lean , or lie down . Mr. Frosty , perambulating on the window sill , walked back and forth in front of the ailanthus tree : Tiger on Frond . The museum . The zoo . The bus to Chinatown . Jeannine sank into the tree gracefully , like a mermaid , bearing with her a tea - cosy to give to the young man who had a huge muffin trembling over his collar where his face ought to have been . Trembling with emotion . The cat spoke . She jerked awake . I 'll feed you , Mr. Frosty . Mrrrr . Cal could n't afford to take her anywhere , really . She had been traveling on the public buses so long that she knew all the routes . Yawning horribly , she ran the water into Mr. Frosty 's cat food and put the dish on the floor . He ate in a dignified way ; she remembered 15 how when she had taken him to her brother 's , they had fed him a real raw fish , just caught in the pond by one of the boys , and how Mr. Frosty had pounced on it , bolting it , he was so eager . They really do like fish . Now he played with the saucer , batting it from side to side , even though he was grown up . Cats were really much happier after you ... after you ... ( she yawned ) Oh , it was Chinese Festival Day . If I had the money , if I could get my hair done . ... He comes into the library ; he 's a college professor ; no , he 's a playboy . "

I do ( thought Jeannine , looking in the precious full - length mirror inexplicably left by the previous tenant on the back of the closet door ) I do look a little bit like ... if I tilt my face . Oh Cal will be SO — MAD and flying back to the bed , she strips off her pajamas and snatches at the underwear she always leaves out on the bureau the night before . Jeannine the Water Nymph . I dreamed about a young man somewhere . She does n't quite believe in cards or omens , that 's totally idiotic , but sometimes she giggles and thinks it would be nice . I have big eyes . You are going to meet a tall , darkPlacing Mr. Frosty firmly on the bed , she pulls on her sweater and skirt , then brushes her hair , counting strokes under her breath . Her coat is so old . Just a little bit of make - up , lip pomade and powder . ( She forgot again and got powder on her coat . ) If she got out early , she would n't have to meet Cal in the room ; he would play with the cat ( down on his hands and knees ) and then want to Make Love ; this way 's better . The bus to Chinatown . She stumbled down the stairs in her haste , catching at the banister . Little Miss Spry , the old 16 lady on the bottom floor , opened her door just in time to catch Miss Dadier flying through the hall . Jeannine saw a small , wrinkled , worried , old face , wispy white hair , and a body like a flour sack done up in a black shapeless dress . One spotted , veined hand round the edge of the door . "

But we wo n't notice them . Jeannine looked in astonishment from their raincoats to Miss Evason 's raincoat . She did not approve at all . “
21302	21317	21318	21318	Boys	659	” she said . Janet pointed to Jeannine for the benefit of the cops . “
21325	22301	21318	21318	Boys	659	" The Chinese New Festival was invented to celebrate the recapture of Hong Kong from the Japanese . Chiang Kai - shek died of heart disease in 1951 and Madam Chiang is premieress of the New China . Japan , which controls the mainland , remains fairly quiet since it lacks the backing of - for example - a reawakened Germany , and if any war occurs , it will be between the Divine Japanese Imperiality and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ( there are twelve ) . Americans do n't worry much . Germany still squabbles occasionally with Italy or England ; France ( disgraced in the abortive putsch of ' 42 ) is beginning to have trouble with its 27 colonial possessions . Britain — wiser — gave India provisional self - government in 1966 . The Depression is still world - wide . ( But think — only think!—what might have happened if the world had not so luckily slowed down , if there had been a really big war , for big wars are forcinghouses of science , economics , politics ; think what might have happened , what might not have happened . It 's a lucky world . Jeannine is lucky to live in it . She does n't think so . ) ( Cal , who came out of the Chinese luncheonette just in time to see his girl go off with three other people , did not throw the lunch buns to the ground in a fit of exasperated rage and stamp on them . Some haunted Polish ancestor looked out of his eyes . He was so thin and slight that his ambitions shone through him : I 'll make it some day , baby . I 'll be the greatest . He sat down on a fire plug and began to eat the buns . She 'll have to come back to feed her cat . ) PART THREE This is the lecture . If you do n't like it , you can skip to the next chapter . Before Janet arrived on this planet I was moody , ill - at - ease , unhappy , and hard to be with . I did n't relish my breakfast . I spent my whole day combing my hair and putting on make - up . Other girls practiced with the shot - put and compared archery scores , but I - indifferent to javelin and crossbow , positively repelled by horticulture and ice hockey — all I did was dress for The Man smile for The Man talk wittily to The Man sympathize with The Man flatter The Man understand The Man defer to The Man entertain The Man keep The Man live for The Man . Then a new interest entered my life . After I called up Janet , out of nothing , or she called up me ( do n't read between the lines ; there 's nothing there ) I began to gain weight , my appetite improved , friends commented on my renewed zest for life , and a nagging scoliosis of the ankle that had tortured me for years simply vanished overnight . I do n't even remember the last time I had to go to the aquarium and stifle my sobs by 29 from that manihe same time she war bones ; she watching the sharks . I rode in closed limousines with Janet to television appearances much like the one you already saw in the last chapter ; I answered her questions ; I bought her a pocket dictionary ; I took her to the zoo ; I pointed out New York 's skyline at night as if I owned it . Oh , I made that woman up ; you can believe it ! Now in the opera scenario that governs our lives , Janet would have gone to a party and at that party she would have met a man and there would have been something about that man ; he would not have seemed to her like any other man she had ever met . Later he would have complimented her on her eyes and she would have blushed with pleasure ; she would have felt that compliment was somehow unlike any other compliment she had ever received because it had come from that man ; she would have wanted to please that man , and at the same time she would have felt the compliment enter the marrow of her bones ; she would have gone out and bought mascara for the eyes that had been complimented by that man . And later still they would have gone for walks , and later still for dinners ; and little dinners tête - à - tête with that man would have been like no other dinners Janet had ever had ; and over the coffee and brandy he would have taken her hand ; and later still Janet would have melted back against the black leather couch in his apartment and thrown her arm across the cocktail table ( which would have been made of elegant teak - wood ) and put down her drink of expensive Scotch and swooned ; she would have simply swooned . She would have said : I Am In Love With That Man . That Is The Meaning Of My Life . And then , of course , you know what would have happened . I made her up . I did everything but find a typical family for her ; if you will remember , she found them herself . But I taught her how to use a bath - tub and I corrected her English ( calm , slow , a hint of whisper in the “
22304	22338	22339	22339	Janet	246	” guardedly ironic ) . I took her out of her workingwoman 's suit and murmured ( as I soaped her hair ) 30 fragments of sentences that I could somehow never finish : “
22353	22905	22339	22339	Janet	246	" That 's different , I said , that 's different . I could n't , I said , oh , I could n't . What I want to say is , I tried ; I 'm a good girl ; I 'll do it if you 'll show me . But what can you do when this woman puts her hand through the wall ? ( Actually the plasterboard partition between the kitchenette and the living room . ) Janet , sit down . Janet , do n't do that . Janet , do n't kick Jeannine . Janet ! Janet , do n't ! I imagine her : civil , reserved , impenetrably formulaic . She was on her company manners for months . Then , I think , she decided that she could get away with having no manners ; or rather , that we did n't honor the ones she had , so why not ? It must have been new to someone from Whileaway , the official tolerance of everything she did or tried to do , the leisure , the attention that was so close to adulation . I have the feeling that any of them can blossom out like that ( and lucky they do n't , eh ? ) with the smooth kinship web of home centuries away , surrounded by barbarians , celibate for months , coping with a culture and a language that I think shein her heart - must have despised . I was housed with her for six and a half months in a hotel suite ordinarily used to entertain visiting diplomats . I put shoes on that woman 's feet . I had fulfilled one of my dreams — to show Manhattan to a foreigner - and I waited for Janet to go to a party and meet that man ; I waited and waited . She walked around the suite nude . She has an awfully big ass . She used to practice her yoga on the white living room rug , callouses on her feet actually catching in the fuzz , if you can believe it . I would put lipstick on Janet and ten minutes later it would have vanished ; I clothed her and she shed like a three - year - old : courteous , kind , irreproachably polite ; I shied at her atrocious jokes and she made them worse . 31 She never communicated with her home , as far as I know . She wanted to see a man naked ( we got pictures ) . She wanted to see a baby man naked ( we got somebody 's nephew ) . She wanted newspapers , novels , histories , magazines , people to interview , television programs , statistics on clove production in the East Indies , textbooks on wheat farming , to visit a bridge ( we did ) . She wanted the blueprints ( we got them ) . She was neat but lazy — I never caught her doing anything . She held the baby like an expert , cooing and trundling , bouncing him up and down so that he stopped screaming and stared at her chin the way babies do . She uncovered him . “

22913	22946	22339	22339	Janet	246	” She was astonished . She scrubbed my back and asked me to scrub hers ; she took the lipstick I gave her and made pictures on the yellow damask walls . ( "
22954	22977	22978	22978	Janet	246	" ) I got her girlie magazines and she said she could n't make head or tail of them ; I said , “
22982	23051	23052	23052	Joanna	200	” and she was surprised ; she had n't meant to . She wanted a dictionary of slang . One day I caught her playing games with Room Service ; she was calling up the different numbers on the white hotel phone and giving them contradictory instructions . This woman was dialing the numbers with her feet . I slammed the phone across one of the double beds . “
23054	23058	23052	23052	Joanna	200	” she said , “
23088	23089	23090	23090	You	200	" “
23093	23097	23090	23090	You	200	” I said ; “
23105	23144	23090	23090	You	200	” Somehow that was all I could think of to say . She tried looking injured and did not succeed - she only looked smug - so she wiped her face clean of all expression and started again . "
23152	23153	23090	23090	You	200	” “
23158	23162	23090	23090	You	200	” I said ; “
23168	23169	23090	23090	You	200	" “
23180	23184	23175	23175	you	200	” she said , “
23191	23202	23175	23175	you	200	" 32 stal , eh ? And they are a dos "
23214	23215	23216	23216	My	0	” “
23219	23224	23216	23216	My	0	” she said gently , “
23292	23432	23286	23286	I	0	” My ruffled dignity . She submitted to the lipstick again . We got her dressed . She looked all right except for that unfortunate habit of whirling around with a grin on her face and her hands out in the judo crouch . Well , well ! I got reasonably decent shoes on Janet Evason 's feet . She smiled . She put her arm around me . Oh , I could n't ! That 's different . ( You 'll hear a lot of those two sentences in life , if you listen for them . I see Janet Evason finally dressing herself , a study in purest awe as she holds up to the light , one after the other , semi - transparent garments of nylon and lace , fairy webs , rose - colored elastic puttees—“Oh
23436	23437	23286	23286	I	0	” “
23443	23670	23286	23286	I	0	” she says — and finally , completely stupefied , wraps one of them around her head . ) She bent down to kiss me , looking kind , looking perplexed , and I kicked her . That 's when she put her fist through the wall . We went to a party on Riverside Drive - incognitae — with Janet a little behind me . At the door , a little behind me . The February snow coming down outside . On the fortieth floor we got out of the elevator and I checked my dress in the hall mirror : my hair feels as if it 's falling down , my makeup 's too heavy , everything 's out of place from the crotch of the panty - hose to the ridden - up bra to the ring whose stone drags it around 33 under my knuckle . And I do n't even wear false eyelashes . Janet - beastly fresh — is showing her usual trick of the Disappearing Lipstick . She hums gently . Batty Joanna . There are policemen posted all around the building , policemen in the street , policemen in the elevator . Nobody wants anything to happen to her . She gives a little yelp of excitement and pleasure — the first uncontrolled contact with the beastly savages . "
23679	23683	23671	23671	You	1226	” she says , “
23688	23707	23686	23686	you	1226	” Ha ha . He he . Ho ho . What fun . She bounces up and down . “
23721	23726	23711	23711	they	1227	" I whisper back . “
23732	23745	23728	23728	she	0	” she says unself - consciously , shifting gears in a moment . “
23785	24019	23773	23773	you	1226	” I opened the door , Janet a little behind me . I knew most of the women there : Sposissa , three times divorced ; Eglantissa , who thinks only of clothes ; Aphrodissa , who can not keep her eyes open because of her false eyelashes ; Clarissa , who will commit suicide ; Lucrissa , whose strained forehead shows that she 's making more money than her husband ; Wailissa , engaged in a game of ain't - it - awful with Lamentissa ; Travailissa , who usually only works , but who is now sitting very still on the couch so that her smile will not spoil ; and naughty Saccharissa , who is playing a round of His Little Girl across the bar with the host . Saccharissa is forty - five . So is Amicissa , the Good Sport . I looked for Ludicrissa , but she is too plain to be invited to a party like this , and of course we never invite Amphibissa , for obvious reasons . In we walked , Janet and I , the right and left hands of a bomb . Actually you might have said everyone was enjoying themselves . I introduced her to everyone . My Swedish cousin . ( Where is Domicissa , who never opens her mouth in public ? And Dulcississa , whose standard line , "
24027	24055	24056	24056	Women	2581	” is oddly missing from the air tonight ? ) I shadowed Janet . 34 I played with my ring . I waited for the remark that begins "
24058	24060	24061	24061	Women	2581	" or "
24063	24065	24068	24068	women	2581	” or “
24069	24162	24068	24068	women	2581	” and kept up an insubstantial conversation on my right . On my left hand Janet stood : very erect , her eyes shining , turning her head swiftly every now and again to follow the current of events at the party . At times like this , when I 'm low , when I 'm anxious , Janet 's attention seems a parody of attention and her energy unbearably high . I was afraid she 'd burst out chuckling . Somebody ( male ) got me a drink . A ROUND OF "
24166	24206	24068	24068	women	2581	" SACCHARISSA : I 'm Your Little Girl . Host ( wheedling ): Are you really ? SACCHARISSA ( complacent ): Yes I am . Host : Then you have to be stupid , too . A SIMULTANEOUS ROUND OF “
24210	24319	24320	24320	You	1237	” LAMENTISSA : When I do the floor , he does n't come home and say it 's wonderful . WAILISSA : Well , darling , we ca n't live without him , can we ? You 'll just have to do better . LAMENTISSA ( wistfully ): I bet you do better . WAILISSA : I do the floor better than anybody I know . LAMENTISSA ( excited ): Does he ever say it 's wonderful ? WAILISSA ( dissolving ): He never says anything ! ( There follows the chorus which gives the game its name . A passing male , hearing this exchange , remarked , “
24336	24374	24320	24320	You	1237	" ) Somebody I did not know came up to us : sharp , balding , glasses reflecting two spots of lamplight . A long , lean , academic , more - or - less young man . "
24382	24385	24376	24376	you	1239	” Janet said "
24393	24422	24320	24320	You	1237	” very long , with exaggerated » enthusiasm . Dear God , do n't let her make a fool of mething toess young maamplight . A 35 herself . “
24426	24437	24320	24320	You	1237	” she said promptly . I introduced my Swedish cousin . “
24454	24455	24320	24320	You	1237	” "
24460	24475	24320	24320	You	1237	” I suppose that , critically speaking , she did n't look too bad . "
24479	24487	24320	24320	You	1237	” she said ( correcting herself ) , "
24504	24515	24498	24498	My	0	” She waits , delighted with everything . He smiles . "
24518	24522	24498	24498	My	0	” he says . “
24526	24538	24498	24498	My	0	” She puts her hand over her heart in unconscious parody . “
24558	24559	24551	24551	My	0	” "
24566	24574	24562	24562	you	0	” says the young man , laughing . “
24577	24582	24562	24562	you	0	" answers my Janet , "
24651	24652	24653	24653	You	0	" "
24660	24664	24656	24656	you	0	” he says . "
24667	24702	24703	24703	You	0	" ( That 's Janet . ) To prevent disaster , I step in and indicate with my eyes that yes , she 's charming and second , we really do want a drink . “
24711	24718	24703	24703	You	0	" Janet says a little irritably . “
24731	24868	24703	24703	You	0	” I say . She nods thoughtfully . I can tell without asking what 's going through her mind : the orderly fields of Whileaway , the centuries - old mutations and hybridizations of cannabis sativa , the little garden plots of marihuana tended ( for all I know ) by seven - year - olds . She had in fact tried some several weeks before . It had made her cough horribly . The youngish man returned with our drink and while I signalled him Stay , stay , she 's harmless , she 's innocent , Janet screwed up her face and tried to drink the stuff in one swallow . It was then I knew that her sense of humor was running away with her . She turned red . She coughed explosively . "
24873	24875	24703	24703	You	0	” 36 "
24882	24889	24703	24703	You	0	” said he , highly amused . “
24896	24897	24890	24890	I	0	” “
24903	24908	24898	24898	I	0	” he proposed amiably , "
24917	24933	24934	24934	Janet	246	” ( There follows a small interlude of us punching each other and whispering vehemently : “
24939	24941	24937	24937	you	246	" ) “
24949	24971	24943	24943	I	0	” she said simply . You 're not supposed to do that . On Whileaway , perhaps , but not here . “
24975	24979	24980	24980	I	0	” he urged . “
24983	24988	24980	24980	I	0	" she said equably . “
24998	25018	24991	24991	I	0	" He takes her hand and closes her fingers around the glass , shaking his forefinger at her playfully : “
25037	25276	25029	25029	you	1243	" and as our methods of courtship seem to make her turn pale , I wink at him and whisk her away to the corner of the apartment where the C.S. vapor blooms . She tries it and gets a coughing fit . She goes sullenly back to the bar . A MANUFACTURER OF CARS FROM LEEDS ( genteelly ): I hear so much about the New Feminism here in America . Surely it 's not necessary , is it ? ( He beams with the delighted air of someone who has just given pleasure to a whole roomful of people . ) SPOSISSA , EGLANTISSA , APHRODISSA , CLARISSA , LUCRISSA , WAILISSA , LAMENTISSA , TRAVAILISSA ( dear God , how many of them are there ? ) , SACCHARISSA , LUDICRISSA ( she came in late ): Oh no , no , no ! ( They all laugh . ) When I got back to the bar , Clarissa was going grimly into her latest heartbreak . I saw Janet , feet apart - a daughter of Whileaway never quails!-trying to get down more than three ounces of straight rum . I suppose one forgets the first taste . She looked flushed and successful . Me : You 're not used to that stuff , Janet . JANET : O.K. , I 'll stop . ( Like all foreigners she is fascinated by the word 37 "
25278	25295	25029	25029	you	1243	” and has been using it on every possible occasion for the last four weeks . ) "
25306	25311	25312	25312	I	0	” she says seriously . “
25335	25336	25337	25337	They	1245	" “
25355	25363	25348	25348	I	0	” bered her . How do yinger Moustachbo “
25371	25375	25376	25376	Janet	246	” I said . “
25381	25467	25376	25376	Janet	246	” This time it was a ginger moustache . Young . Nice . Flashy . Flowered waistcoat . Hip . ( hip ? ) Peals of laughter from the corner , where Eglantissa 's latest is holding up and wiggling a chain made of paper clips . Wailissa fusses ineffectually around him . Eglantissa — looking more and more like a corpse - sits on an elegant , brocaded armchair , with her drink rigid in her hand . Blue smoke wreathes about her head . "
25470	25479	25376	25376	Janet	246	” says Ginger Moustache . Sincere . Young . “
25487	25507	25484	25484	you	0	” says Janet . She 's remembered her manners . Ginger Moustache produces a smile and a cigarette case . “
25510	25518	25484	25484	you	0	” says Janet hopefully . He chuckles . "
25527	25533	25522	25522	you	246	” . She looks sulky . “
25546	25554	25544	25544	you	246	" I introduce my cousin from Sweden . “
25565	25581	25582	25582	Sickness	366	” she bursts out . Still on her mind , it seems . I explain . "
25584	25588	25582	25582	Sickness	366	" he says . “
25697	25704	25706	25706	Janet	246	" A - a - ah , ”
25714	25719	25706	25706	Janet	246	“ Yes . Aha . ”
25800	25844	25784	25784	She	246	“ We have a saying : when the child goes to the school , both mother and child howl ; the child because it is going to be separated from the mother and the mother because she has to go back to work . ”
25845	25856	25858	25859	Ginger Moustache	365	“ The tie between mother and child is very important , ”
25863	25876	25858	25859	Ginger Moustache	365	“ Excuse me , let me move that cushion behind your back . "
25878	25892	25893	25893	he	365	“ I 'm sure Swedish mothers really groove on their kids , though , ”
25896	25899	25902	25902	Janet	246	" Huh ? ”
25917	25920	25921	25921	he	365	" Listen , ”
25924	25983	25921	25921	he	365	" some time I want you to meet my wife . I know this is a bad scene - I mean meeting you here with the plastic people , y'know?—but some day you 're going to come out to Vermont and meet my wife . It 's a great , heavy scene . We 've got six kids . "
25984	25991	25993	25993	Janet	246	“ Six you take care of ? ”
25998	26001	26002	26002	he	365	" Sure , ”
26005	26028	26002	26002	he	365	“ They 're in Vermont right now . But after this work hassle is over I 'm going back . You grok ? "
26045	26048	26050	26051	Ginger Moustache	365	" Hey , ”
26058	26080	26050	26051	Ginger Moustache	365	“ it 's been great meeting you . You 're a real ballsy chick . I mean you 're a woman . "
26087	26090	26081	26081	She	246	“ What ? ”
26091	26116	26050	26051	Ginger Moustache	365	" Sorry about the slang ; I mean you 're a fine person . It 's a pleasure - to - know - you . ”
26117	26124	26125	26125	she	246	" You do n't know me , "
26168	26174	26175	26175	he	365	" Yeah , I know , "
26178	26206	26175	26175	he	365	" How can we get to 39 know each other in ten minutes , huh ? That 's true . It 's a formal phrase : pleasuretoknowyou . ”
26210	26213	26214	26214	he	365	“ Right ? ”
26217	26229	26231	26231	she	246	“ Tell you what , give me your name and address . ”
26236	26251	26231	26231	she	246	“ I 'll drop you a line . Write a letter , that is . ”
26424	26429	26431	26432	Janet Evason	246	" Oh , that ! ”
26471	26476	26486	26486	she	246	“ Oh , that ! ”
26477	26485	26486	26486	she	246	“ That 's from my third duel , ”

26509	26513	26515	26515	Moustache	365	“ Your what ? ”

26658	26688	26651	26651	I	0	” And she draws her forefinger across her throat with a melodramatic jerk . This mad chick does n't seem so nice to Moustache any more . He swallows . “

27646	27649	27651	27651	she	246	“ What is ”
27655	27669	27651	27651	she	246	" what is my English is not so good . Could you explain ? ”
27670	27689	27628	27628	He	372	" Well , what do you think of women ? Do you think women can compete with men ? ”
27690	27698	27628	27628	He	372	" I do n't know any men . ”
27706	27710	27712	27713	Sharp Glasses	372	" Ha ha ! ”
27715	27723	27712	27713	Sharp Glasses	372	“ Ha ha ha ! Ha ha ! ”
27737	27747	27712	27713	Sharp Glasses	372	“ My name 's Ewing . What 's yours ? ”
27748	27751	27712	27713	Sharp Glasses	372	“ Janet . ”
27752	27780	27712	27713	Sharp Glasses	372	“ Well , Janet , Tll tell you what I think of the new feminism . I think it 's a mistake . A very bad mistake , "
27781	27784	27786	27786	Janet	246	" Oh , "
27801	27812	27814	27814	Ewing	373	“ I have n't got anything against women 's intelligence , ”
27816	27839	27814	27814	Ewing	373	“ Some of my colleagues are women . It 's not women 's intelligence . It 's women 's psychology . Eh ? ”
27858	27866	27868	27868	Ewing	373	“ What you 've got to remember , "
27876	27901	27868	27868	Ewing	373	“ is that most women are liberated right now . They like what they 're doing . They do it because they like it . "
27907	27922	27905	27905	Janet	246	“ Not only that , you gals are going about it the wrong way . "
27934	27945	27946	27946	he	1288	“ You ca n't challenge men in their own fields , "
27949	28027	27946	27946	he	1288	“ Now nobody can be more in favor of women getting their rights than I am . Do you want to sit down ? Let 's . As I said , I 'm all in favor of it . Adds a decorative touch to the office , eh ? Ha ha ! Ha ha ha ! Unequal pay is a disgrace . But you 've got to remember , Janet , that women have certain physical limitations , ”
28071	28082	28043	28044	Ada hal	374	“ and you have to work within your physical limitations . “
28086	28100	28043	28044	Ada hal	374	” he went on , mistaking her silence for wisdom while Ludicrissa muttered , “
28107	28118	28043	28044	Ada hal	374	” somewhere in the background about some thing or other , “
28175	28213	28165	28165	Men	2593	” ( Picture me on the back of the couch , clinging to her hair like a homuncula , battering her on the top of the head until she does n't dare to open her mouth . ) "
28219	28224	28217	28217	Janet	246	” he went on , "
28292	28311	28287	28287	Hal	375	” And off he went into another fit . She squeaked something — because I was strangling her . “
28314	28318	28321	28321	you	246	” he said . “
28324	28389	28321	28321	you	246	" He looked at her nearsightedly . Our struggle must have imparted an unusual intensity to her expression because he seemed extraordinarily flattered by what he saw ; he turned his head away coyly , sneaked a look out of the corner of his eye , and then whipped his head round into position very fast . As if he had been a bird . “
28396	28435	28436	28436	Janet	246	” he said . He began to perspire gently . He shifted the pieces of his napkin from hand to hand . He dropped them and dusted his hands off . Now he 's going to do it . “
28447	28452	28445	28445	you	246	” fumbling blindly for his drink—“that
28460	28486	28458	28458	you	246	" . But we are far away , throwing coats out of the coat closet like a geyser . Is that your method of courtship ! "
28490	28494	28458	28458	you	246	” I said . “
28497	28535	28495	28495	You	246	" 44 Baby , baby , baby . It 's the host , drunk enough not to care . Uh - oh . Be ladylike . She showed him all her teeth . He saw a smile . “
28542	28543	28495	28495	You	246	" "
28551	28557	28547	28547	I	0	" ( good for her ) "
28560	28569	28547	28547	I	0	” and he took us by the wrist . “
28577	28578	28547	28547	I	0	" “
28583	28640	28547	28547	I	0	” said Janet . Say it loud . Somebody will come to rescue you . Ca n't I rescue myself ? No . Why not ? Al this time he was nuzzling her ear and I was showing my distaste by shrinking terrified into a corner , one eye on the party . Everyone seemed amused . “
28649	28676	28547	28547	I	0	” said the host , who might have been attractive under other circumstances , a giant marine , so to speak . I pushed him away . “
28685	28778	28680	28680	you	0	” he said and enfolding us in his powerful arms , et cetera — well , not so very powerful as all that , but I want to give you the feeling of the scene . If you scream , people say you 're melodramatic ; if you submit , you 're masochistic ; if you call names , you 're a bitch . Hit him and he 'll kill you . The best thing is to suffer mutely and yearn for a rescuer , but suppose the rescuer does n't come ? “
28782	28795	28680	28680	you	0	" said Janet ( some Russian word I did n't catch ) . "
28802	28816	28800	28800	me	0	” said the host , squeezing her wrist and puckering up his lips ; “
28823	28844	28800	28800	me	0	” and he swung his hips from side to side suggestively . No , no , keep on being ladylike ! “
28850	28854	28800	28800	me	0	” shouted Janet . "
28863	28878	28879	28879	Savages	1302	” She had an extraordinarily loud voice . He laughed and shook her wrist . “
28881	28915	28879	28879	Savages	1302	” she shouted . A hush had fallen on the party . The host leafed dexterously through his little book of rejoinders but did not come up with anything . Then he looked up "
28917	28927	28800	28800	me	0	” only to find it marked with an affirmative : “
28938	28951	28800	28800	me	0	” So be smiled broadly . He put the book away . 45 “
28957	29040	28955	28955	sister	1303	” he said . So she dumped him . It happened in a blur of speed and there he was on the carpet . He was flipping furiously through the pages of the book ; what else is there to do in such circumstances ? ( It was a little limpleather - excuse memvolume bound in blue , which I think they give out in high schools . On the cover was written in gold WHAT TO DO IN EVERY SITUATION . ) “
29043	29049	28955	28955	sister	1303	” ( flip flip flip ) “
29052	29057	28955	28955	sister	1303	” ( flip flip ) “
29060	29067	29068	29070	Goddamn cancerous castrator	1304	” ( flip flip flip flip ) “
29072	29076	29068	29070	Goddamn cancerous castrator	1304	” ( flip ) “
29082	29087	29088	29088	You	1305	” ( flip flip ) "
29096	29222	29223	29223	Joanna	348	” Was ist ? said Janet in German . He gave her to understand that she was going to die of cancer of the womb . She laughed . He gave her to understand further that she was taking unfair advantage of his good manners . She roared . He pursued the subject and told her that if he were not a gentleman he would ram her stinking , shitty teeth up her stinking shitty ass . She shrugged . He told her she was so ball - breaking , shitty , stone , scum - bag , mother - fucking , plug - ugly that no normal male could keep up an erection within half a mile of her . She looked puzzled . ( “
29231	29376	29377	29377	YOU	1306	" ) He got up . I think he was recovering his cool . He did not seem nearly so drunk as he had been . He shrugged his sports jacket back into position and brushed himself off . He said she had acted like a virgin , not knowing what to do when a guy made a pass , just like a Goddamned scared little baby virgin . Most of us would have been content to leave it at that , eh , ladies ? Janet slapped him . It was not meant to hurt , I think ; it was a great big stinging theatrical performance , a cue for insults and further fighting , a come - on - get - your - guard con- 46 temptuous slap meant to enrage , which it jolly well did . THE MARINE SAID , “
29386	29500	29620	29620	He	1310	” That poor man . I did n't see things very well , as first off I got behind the closet door , but I saw him rush her and I saw her flip him ; he got up again and again she deflected him , this time into the wall — I think she was worried because she did n't have time to glance behind her and the place was full of people — then he got up again and this time he swung instead and then something very complicated happened — he let out a yell and she was behind him , doing something cool and technical , frowning in concentration . "
29507	29511	29512	29512	You	1309	” she said . “
29518	29565	29512	29512	You	1309	" So he pulled . The little limp - leather notebook fluttered out on to the floor , from whence I picked it up . Everything was awfully quiet . The pain had stunned him , I guess . She said in astonished good - humor : "
29580	29611	29569	29569	you	1309	” I got my coat and I got Janet 's coat and I got us out of there and into the elevator . I put my head in my hands . “
29618	29619	29614	29614	you	1309	” "
29626	29652	29620	29620	He	1310	” The little blue book was rattling around in my purse . I took it out and turned to the last thing he had said ( “
29656	29674	29653	29655	You stupid broad	1312	” et cetera ) . Underneath was written Girl backs down - cries - manhood vindicated . Under "
29679	29710	29678	29678	Girl	3073	” was written Do n't hurt ( except whores ) . I took out my own pink book , for we all carry them , and turning to the instructions under “
29712	29749	29678	29678	Girl	3073	” found : Man 's bad temper is the woman 's fault . It is also the woman 's responsibility to patch things up afterwards . There were sub - rubrics , one ( reinforcing ) under "
29751	29758	29678	29678	Girl	3073	” and one ( exceptional ) under “
29761	29786	29678	29678	Girl	3073	” Everything in my book begins with an M. 47 They do fit together so well , you know . I said to Janet : “
29799	29800	29791	29791	you	1314	" “
29808	30302	29791	29791	you	1314	” she answered . Why make pretensions to fight ( she said ) when you ca n't fight ? Why make pretensions to anything ? I am trained , of course ; that 's my job , and it makes me the very devil angry when someone calls me names , but why call names ? All this uneasy aggression . True , there is a little bit of hair - pulling on Whileaway , yes , and more than that , there is the temperamental thing , sometimes you ca n't stand another person . But the cure for that is distance . I 've been foolish in the past , I admit . In middle - age one begins to settle down ; Vittoria says I 'm comic with my tohu - bohu when Yuki comes home with a hair out of place . I hope not . There is this thing with the child you 've borne yourself , your bodychild . There is also the feeling to be extra - proper in front of the children , yet hardly anybody bothers . Who has the time ? And since I 've become Š & P I have a different outlook on all this : a job 's a job and has to be done , but I do n't like doing it for nothing , to raise the hand to someone . For sport , yes , okay , for hatred no . Separate them . I ought to add there was a fourth duel in which nobody got killed ; my opponent developed a lung infection , then a spinal infection — you understand , we were n't near civilization then and the convalescence was such a long , nasty business . I took care of her . Nerve tissue 's hard to regrow . She was paralyzed for a while , you know . Gave me a very salutary scare . So I do n't fight with weapons now , except on my job , of course . Am I sorry I hurt him ? Not me ! Whileawayans are not nearly as peaceful as they sound . Burned any bras lately har har twinkle twinkle A pretty girl like you does n't need to be liberated twinkle har Do n't listen to those hysterical bitches twinkle twinkle twinkle I never take a woman 's advice about two things : love and automobiles twinkle twinkle har May I kiss your little hand twinkle twinkle twinkle . Har . Twinkle . On Whileaway they have a saying : When the mother and child are separated they both howl , the child because it is separated from the mother , the mother because she has to go back to work . Whileawayans bear their children at about thirty - singletons or twins as the demographic pressures require . These children have as one genotypic parent the biological mother ( the "
30306	30319	29791	29791	you	1314	” ) while the non - bearing parent contributes the other ovum ( “
30322	30459	29791	29791	you	1314	” ) . Little Whileawayans are to their mothers both sulk and swank , fun and profit , pleasure and contemplation , a show of expensiveness , a slowing - down of life , an opportunity to pursue whatever interests the women have been forced to neglect previously , and the only leisure they have ever had or will have again until old age . A fun and press , a slowinterests the only leisura portunity to po neglect previ have again 49 family of thirty persons may have as many as four mother - and - child pairs in the common nursery at one time . Food , cleanliness , and shelter are not the mother 's business ; Whileawayans say with a straight face that she must be free to attend to the child 's “
30464	30761	29791	29791	you	1314	” Then they go off by themselves and roar . The truth is they do n't want to give up the leisure . Eventually we come to a painful scene . At the age of four or five these independent , blooming , pampered , extremely intelligent little girls are torn weeping and arguing from their thirty relatives and sent to the regional school , where they scheme and fight for weeks before giving in ; some of them have been known to construct deadfalls or small bombs ( having picked this knowledge up from their parents ) in order to obliterate their instructors . Children are cared for in groups of five and taught in groups of differing sizes according to the subject under discussion . Their education at this point is heavily practical : how to run machines , how to get along without machines , law , transportation , physical theory , and so on . They learn gymnastics and mechanics . They learn practical medicine . They learn how to swim and shoot . They continue ( by themselves ) to dance , to sing , to paint , to play , to do everything their Mommies did . At puberty they are invested with Middle - Dignity and turned loose ; children have the right of food and lodging wherever they go , up to the power of the community to support them . They do not go back home . Some do , of course , but then neither Mother may be there ; people are busy ; people are traveling ; there 's always work , and the big people who were so kind to a four - year - old have little time for an almost - adult . “
30768	31108	29791	29791	you	1314	” said one girl . Some , wild with the desire for exploration , travel all around the world — usually in the company of other children - bands of children going to visit this or that , or bands of children about to reform the power installations , are a common sight on Whileaway . The more profound abandon all possessions and live off the land just above or below the forty - eighth parallel ; they return with animal heads , scars , visions . 50 Some make a beeline for their callings and spend most of puberty pestering part - time actors , bothering part - time musicians , cajoling part - time scholars . Fools ! ( say the older children , who have been through it all ) Do n't be in such a hurry . You 'll work soon enough . At seventeen they achieve Three - Quarters Dignity and are assimilated into the labor force . This is probably the worst time in a Whileawayan 's life . Groups of friends are kept together if the members request it and if it is possible , but otherwise these adolescents go where they 're needed , not where they wish ; nor can they join the Geographical Parliament nor the Professional Parliament until they have entered a family and developed that network of informal associations of the like - minded which is Whileaway 's substitute for everything else but family . They provide human companionship to Whileawayan cows , who pine and die unless spoken to affectionately . They run routine machinery , dig people out of landslides , oversee food factories ( with induction helmets on their heads , their toes controlling the greenpeas , their fingers the vats and controls , their back muscles the carrots , and their abdomens the water supply ) . They lay pipe ( again , by induction ) . They fix machinery . They are not allowed to have anything to do with malfunctions or breakdowns “
31112	31165	29791	29791	you	1314	” as the Whileawayans say , meaning in one 's own person and with tools in one 's own hands , without the induction helmets that make it possible to operate dozens of waldoes at just about any distance you please . That 's for veterans . They do not meddle with computers “
31168	31413	31930	31930	you	1319	" nor join with them via induction . That 's for old veterans . They learn to like a place only to be ordered somewhere else the next day , commandeered to excavate coastline or fertilize fields , kindly treated by the locals ( if any ) and hideously bored . It gives them something to look forward to . At twenty - two they achieve Full Dignity and may 51 either begin to learn the heretofore forbidden jobs or have their learning formally certificated . They are allowed to begin apprenticeships . They may marry into pre - existing families or form their own . Some braid their hair . By now the typical Whileawayan girl is able to do any job on the planet , except for specialties and extremely dangerous work . By twenty - five she has entered a family , thus choosing her geographical home base ( Whileawayans travel all the time ) . Her family probably consists of twenty to thirty other persons , ranging in age from her own to the early fifties . ( Families tend to age the way people do ; thus new groupings are formed again in old age . Approximately every fourth girl must begin a new or join a nearly - new family . ) Sexual relations which have begun at pubertycontinue both inside the family and outside it , but mostly outside it . Whileawayans have two explanations for this . "
31416	31429	31930	31930	you	1319	” they say for the first explanation , and for the second , "
31433	31489	31930	31930	you	1319	” Whileawayan psychology locates the basis of Whileawayan character in the early indulgence , pleasure , and flowering which is drastically curtailed by the separation from the mothers . This ( it says ) gives Whileawayan life its characteristic independence , its dissatisfaction , its suspicion , and its tendency toward a rather irritable solipsism . “
31492	31503	31930	31930	you	1319	" ( said the same Dunyasha Bernadetteson , q.v . ) “
31514	31905	31930	31930	you	1319	” Eternal optimism hides behind this dissatisfaction , however ; Whileawayans can not forget that early paradise and every new face , every new day , every smoke , every dance , brings back life 's possibilities . Also sleep and eating , sunrise , weather , the seasons , machinery , gossip , and the eternal temptations of art . They work too much . They are incredibly tidy . Yet on the old stone bridge that links New City , South Continent , with Varya 's Little Alley Ho - ho is chiseled : You never know what is enough until you know what is more than enough . If one is lucky , one 's hair turns white early ; if - as 52 in old Chinese poetry - one is indulging oneself , one dreams of old age . For in old age the Whileawayan woman - no longer as strong and elastic as the young_has learned to join with calculating machines in the state they say ca n't be described but is most like a sneeze that never comes off . It is the old who are given the sedentary jobs , the old who can spend their days mapping , drawing , thinking , writing , collating , composing . In the libraries old hands come out from under the induction helmets and give you the reproductions of the books you want ; old feet twinkle below the computer shelves , hanging down like Humpty Dumpty 's ; old ladies chuckle eerily while composing The Blasphemous Cantata ( a great favorite of Ysaye 's ) or mad - moon cityscapes which turn out to be do - able after all ; old brains use one part in fifty to run a city ( with checkups made by two sulky youngsters ) while the other forty - nine parts riot in a freedom they have n't had since adolescence . The young are rather priggish about the old on Whileaway . They do n't really approve of them . Taboos on Whileaway : sexual relations with anybody considerably older or younger than oneself , waste , ignorance , offending others without intending to And of course the usual legal checks on murder and theft - both those crimes being actually quite difficult to commit . ( “
31908	31912	31930	31930	you	1319	” says Chilia , “
31944	32036	31938	31938	she	1318	" ) No Whileawayan works more than three hours at a time on any one job , except in emergencies . No Whileawayan marries monogamously . ( Some restrict their sexual relations to one other personat least while that other person is nearby — but there is no legal arrangement . ) Whileawayan psychology again refers to the distrust of the mother and the reluctance to form a tie that will engage every level of emotion , all the person , all the time . And the necessity for artificial dissatisfactions . “
32039	32050	31938	31938	she	1318	” ( says Dunyasha Bernadetteson , op . cit . ) “
32076	32414	32074	32074	nyet	1321	" But there is too , under it all , the incredible explosive energy , the gaiety of high intelligence , the obliquities of wit , the cast of mind that makes industrial areas into gardens and ha - has , that supports wells of wilderness where nobody ever lives for long , that strews across a planet sceneries , mountains , glider preserves , culs - de - sac , comic nude statuary , artistic lists of tautologies and circular mathematical proofs ( over which aficionados are moved to tears ) , and the best graffiti in this or any other world . Whileawayans work all the time . They work . And they work . And they work . VII Two ancients on the direct computer line between city and quarry ( private persons have to be content with spark - gap radio ) , fighting at the top of their lungs while five green girls wait nearby , sulky and bored : I ca n't make do with five greenies , I need two onfoot checkers and protective gear for onel Ca n't have . IncompYou hear . Is me ! ( affected disdain ) If catastrophWon't ! And so on . VITI A troop of little girls contemplating three silver hoops welded to a silver cube are laughing so hard that 54 some have fallen down into the autumn leaves on the plaza and are holding their stomachs . This is not embarrassment or an ignorant reaction to something new ; they are genuine connoisseurs who have hiked for three days to see this . Their hip - packs lie around the edge of the plaza , near the fountains . One : How lovely ! Between shifts in the quarry in Newland , Henla Anaisson sings , her only audience her one fellowworker . A Belin , run mad and unable to bear the tediousness of her work , flees above the forty - eighth parallel , intending to remain there permanently . “

32430	32489	32492	32492	me	0	” and although agreeing philosophically with this common view , the S & P for the county follows her — not to return her for rehabilitation , imprisonment , or study . What is there to rehabilitate or study ? We 'd all do it if we could . And imprisonment is simple cruelty . You guessed it . "
32496	32505	32492	32492	me	0	” ( wrote Dunyasha Bernadetteson in 368 A.C. ) “
32507	32515	32492	32492	me	0	“ If me or mine - alas . "
32524	32613	32614	32614	Janet	246	” 55 XII Whileaway is engaged in the reorganization of industry consequent to the discovery of the induction principle . The Whileawayan work - week is sixteen hours . 56 PART FOUR After six months of living with me in the hotel suite , Janet Evason expressed the desire to move in with a typical family . I heard her singing in the bathroom : I know That my Rede - emer Liveth And She Shall stand Upon the latter da - ay On Earth . ( ruffle ) “
32616	32677	32678	32678	Janet	246	” She sang again ( not badly ) the second variation on the lines , in which the soprano begins to decorate the tune : I know ( up ) Tha - at my ( ruffile ) Re - e - edeemer ( fiddle ) Liveth And She Shall stand ( convex ) And She Shall stand ( concave ) 57 “
32685	32783	32784	32784	JANET	246	” I yelled . She went into the third variation , where the melody liquefies itself into its own adornments , very nice and quite improper : I know ( up ) That my redee ( a high point , this one ) mer Li - i - veth ( up up up ) And She Shall stand ( hopefully ) And She shall stand ( higher ) Upon the la - a - a - a - atter da - a - a - y ( ruffle fiddle drip ) O - on Earth ( settling ) "
32786	33066	32784	32784	JANET	246	” But of course she does n't listen . Whileawayans like big asses , so I am glad to report there was nothing of that kind in the family she moved in with . Father , mother , teenage daughter , and family dog were all delighted to be famous . Daughter was an honor student in the local high school . When Janet got settled I drifted into the attic ; my spirit seized possession of the old four - poster bed stored next to the chimney , near the fur coats and the shopping bag full of dolls ; and slowly , slowly , I infected the whole house . Laura Rose Wilding of Anytown , U.S.A. She has a black poodle who whines under the trees in the back yard and bares his teeth as he rolls over and over in the dead leaves . She 's reading the Christian Existentialists for a course in school . She crosses the October weather , glowing with health , to 58 shake hands clumsily with Miss Evason . She 's pathologically shy . She puts one hand in the pocket of her jeans , luminously , the way well - beloved or muchstudied people do , tugging at the zipper of her man 's leather jacket with the other hand . She has short sandy hair and freckles . Says over and over to herself Non Sum , Non Sum , which means either I do n't exist or I 'm not that , according to how you feel it ; this is what Martin Luther is supposed to have said during his fit in the monastery choir . “
33072	33100	32784	32784	JANET	246	" The black poodle , Samuel , whined and scurried across the porch , then barked hysterically , defending the house against God - knows - what . "
33107	33225	32784	32784	JANET	246	" they all said . Janet , in her black - and - white tweeds with the fox collar like a movie star 's , gave a speech to the local women 's club . She did n't say much . Someone gave her chrysanthemums which she held upside - down like a baseball bat . A professor from the local college spoke of other cultures . A whole room was full of offerings brought by the club_brownies , fudge cake , sour cream cake , honey buns , pumpkin pienot to be eaten , of course , only looked at , but they did eat it finally because somebody has to or it is n't real . “
33236	33560	33229	33229	Mildred	386	” and she faints with happiness . Laur , who is reading psychology for the Existentialists ( I said that , did n't I ? ) , serves coffee to the club in the too - big man 's shirt they ca n't ever get her out of , no matter what they do , and her ancient , shape 59 less jeans . Swaddling graveclothes . She 's a bright girl . She learned in her thirteenth year that you can get old films of Mae West or Marlene Dietrich ( who is a Vulcan ; look at the eyebrows ) after midnight on UHF if you know where to look , at fourteen that pot helps , at fifteen that reading 's even better . She learned , wearing her rimless glasses , that the world is full of intelligent , attractive , talented women who manage to combine careers with their primary responsibilities as wives and mothers and whose husbands beat them . She 's put a gold circle pin on her shirt as a concession to club day . She loves her father and once is enough . Everyone knows that much as women want to be scientists and engineers , they want foremost to be womanly companions to men ( what ? ) and caretakers of childhood ; everyone knows that a large part of a woman 's identity inheres in the style of her attractiveness . Laur is daydreaming . She looks straight before her , blushes , smiles , and does n't see a thing . After the party she 'll march stiff - legged out of the room and up to her bedroom ; sitting tailor - fashion on her bed , she 'll read Engels on the family and make in the margin her neat , concise , perfectly written notes . She has shelves and shelves of such annotated works . Not for her “
33567	33569	33229	33229	Mildred	386	” or "
33574	33762	33229	33229	Mildred	386	” She 's surrounded by mermaids , fish , sea - plants , wandering fronds . Drifting on the affective currents of the room are those strange social artifacts half dissolved in nature and mystery : some pretty girls . Laur is daydreaming that she 's Genghis Khan . due to read . conces A beautiful chick who swims naked and whose breasts float on the water like flowers , a chick in a rain - tight shirt who says she balls with her friends but does n't get uptight about it , that 's the real thing . trives made por here childrenss the valley , town And I like Anytown ; I like going out on the porch at night to look at the lights of the town : fireflies in the blue gloaming , across the valley , up the hill , white homes where children played and rested , where wives made potato salad , home from a day in the autumn leaves chasing sticks with the family dog , families in the firelight , thousands upon thousands of identical , cozy days . “
33769	33784	33764	33764	you	1327	” asked Janet over dessert , never thinking that she might be lied to . “
33787	33791	33764	33764	you	1327	” said Laur . “
33803	33808	33792	33793	Our guest	1329	" said Mrs. Wilding . “
33811	34040	34041	34041	I	0	” said Laur . VIII There are more whooping cranes in the United States of America than there are women in Congress . This then is Laura 's worst mind : perpetually snowed in , a dim upstairs ball wrapped in cotton wool with Self counting rocks and shells in the window - seat . One can see nothing outside the glass but falling white sky - no footprints , no faces — though occasionally Self strays to the window , itself drowned in snowlight , and sees ( or thinks she sees ) in the petrified whirling waste 61 the buried forms of two dead lovers , innocent and sexless , memorialized in a snowbank . Turn away , girl ; gird up your loins ; go on reading . Janet dreamed that she was skating backwards , Laura that a beautiful stranger was teaching her how to shoot . In dreams begin responsibilities . Laura came down to the breakfast table after everybody had gone except Miss Evason . Whileawayans practice secret dream interpretation according to an arbitrary scheme they consider idiotic but very funny ; Janet was guiltily seeing how contrary she could make her dream come out and giggling around her buttered toast . She snickered and shed crumbs . When Laura came into the room Janet sat up straight and did n't guffaw . “
34043	34053	33792	33793	Our guest	1329	” said Laur severely , the victim of ventriloquism , "
34065	34199	34200	34200	I	0	” Janet and I said nothing . We noticed the floss and dew on the back of her neck - Laur is in some ways more like a thirteen - year - old than a seventeen - year - old . She mugs , for instance . At sixty Janet will be white - haired and skinny , with surprised blue eyes quite a handsome human being . And Janet herself always likes people best as themselves , not dressed up , so Laur 's big shirt tickled her , ditto those impossible trousers . She wanted to ask if it was one shirt or many ; do you scream when you catch sight of yourself ? She soberly held out a piece of buttered toast and Laur took it with a grimace . "
34204	34213	34200	34200	I	0	” said Laur in an entirely different tone , "
34238	34243	34244	34244	I	0	" Sharp and adult . "
34254	34383	34246	34246	I	0	” she added . We thought of confiding to her the secret dreamsystem by which Whileawayans transform matter and embrace the galaxies but then we thought better of it . 62 Janet was trying in a bafiled way to pick up the crumbs she had dropped ; Whileawayans do n't eat crunchables . I left her and floated up to the whatnot , on which were perched two biscuit - china birds , beak twined in beak , a cut - glass salt dish , a small , wooden Mexican hat , a miniature silver basket , and a terracotta ashtray shaped realistically like a camel . Laur looked up for a moment , preternaturally hard and composed . I am a spirit , remember . She said : “
34389	34390	34246	34246	I	0	” “
34393	34505	34506	34506	I	0	” said Janet . This response is considered quite polite on Whileaway . I , the plague system darting in the air between them , pinched Janet 's ears , plucked them up like Death in the poem . Nowhere , neither undersea nor on the moon , have I , in my bodiless wanderings , met with a more hard - headed innocence than Miss Evason brings to the handling of her affairs . In the bluntness of her imagination she unbuttoned Laur 's shirt and slid her pants down to her knees . The taboos in Whileawayan society are cross - age taboos . Miss Evason no longer smiled . “
34513	34520	34506	34506	I	0	” the little girl repeated aggressively . “
34524	34571	34521	34521	You	0	" ( Imitation Laura was smiling helplessly and freshly over her shoulder , shivering a little as her breasts were touched . What we like is the look of affection . ) She studied her plate . She drew a design on it with her finger . "
34574	34578	34521	34521	You	0	” she said . “
34586	34587	34579	34579	I	0	" “
34592	34800	34579	34579	I	0	” said Janet . I bet your knees turn in . Janet did n't think so . There are these fashion magazines scattered through the house , Mrs. Wilding reads them , pornography for the high - minded . Girls in wet knit bathing suits with their hair dripping , silly girls drowned in sweaters , serious girls in backless jersey evening dresses that barely cover the fine - boned lyres of their small chests . They 're all slim and young . Pushing and prodding the little girl as you fit a dress on her . Stand here . Stand there . How , swooning , they fell into each other 's arms . Janet , who ( unlike me ) never imagines what ca n't be done , wiped her mouth , folded her napkin , pushed back her chair , got up , and followed 63 Laur into the living room . Up the stairs . Laur took a notebook from her desk and handed it to Miss Evason . We stood there uncertainly , ready to laugh or cry ; Janet looked down at the manuscript , up over the edge at Laura , down again for a few more lines . Peek . "
34807	34817	34801	34801	I	0	” I said . Laura raised her eyebrows severely . "
34827	34831	34818	34818	I	0	” Janet said . “
34840	34912	34913	34914	Your teacher	1334	” Laura frowned . I thought she might wring her hands but no such luck . She went back to the desk and picked up something else , which she handed to Miss Evason . I knew enough to recognize mathematics , that 's all . She tried to stare Janet down . Janet followed a few lines , smiled thoughtfully , then came to a hitch . Some thing wrong . "
34916	34921	34913	34914	Your teacher	1334	” began Miss Evason . "
34929	34934	34922	34922	I	0	” said perspicacious Laur . "
34945	34946	34938	34938	myself	0	” “
34953	34957	34938	34938	myself	0	” said Janet ; "
34960	35070	34938	34938	myself	0	" and she proceeded to scribble in the margin . What an extraordinary phenomenon mathematical symbols are ! I flew to the curtains , curtains Mrs. Wilding had washed and ironed with her own hands . No , she took them to the cleaner 's , popping the clutch of the Wildings ' station wagon . She read Freud in the time she would have used to wash and iron the curtains . They were n't Laur 's choice . She would have torn them down with her own hands . She wept . She pleaded . She fainted . Et cetera . They bent over the book together . "
35073	35081	35082	35082	You	1336	” said Janet , in surprised pleasure . “
35086	35093	35210	35210	I	0	” ( that was Laur ) . "
35108	35123	35105	35106	an amateur	1337	” said Miss Evason , swimming like a seal in the sea of numbers . “
35136	35151	35105	35106	an amateur	1337	" quoted Laur and turned scarlet . The rest goes : I mene love . “
35154	35160	35105	35106	an amateur	1337	” said Janet , absorbed . "
35170	35174	35175	35176	A man	810	” said Laur . "
35178	35207	35226	35226	she	246	" A really extraordinary expression , what they mean by calling someone 's face a study - she ca n't know number the life so med scarlet.bsorbed school , "
35229	35234	35226	35226	she	246	“ Oh , sure , ”
35255	35261	35250	35250	She	246	“ You 're too young . ”
35273	35277	35278	35278	she	246	“ Of course , ”
35347	35358	35331	35332	a man	810	“ Why do n't you smile ? God loves you ! "
35461	35473	35458	35458	I	0	“ I 'm not a girl , I 'm a genius , ”
35639	35645	35646	35646	I	0	“ Sure , washing floors , "
35649	35660	35661	35661	she	720	“ I have honor the park , possibly 65 you , ”
35732	35743	35728	35729	My father	1364	“ What the hell is she fussing about this time ? ”
35891	35902	35888	35889	The Man	228	" I never had a thought that was n't yours . ”
35918	35926	35915	35915	they	1378	" What are you getting upset about ? ”
36104	36117	36101	36101	he	1385	“ Oho , I got my kiss ! I got my kiss ! ”
36203	36354	36197	36197	you	0	" . 66 Then hathe excedi all . me I might not realize it , but I was living a very dangerous style of life that might in time lead to Lesbianism ( hal ha ! ) and I should try to look and act more feminine . I laughed until I cried . Then he said I must understand that femininity was a Good Thing , and although men 's and women 's functions in society were different , they had equal dignity . Separate but equal , right ? Men make the decisions and women make the dinners . I expected him to start in about that mysticallywonderful - experience - which - no - man - can - know crap , but he did n't . Instead he took me to the window and showed me the expensive clothing stores across the way . Then he said , “
36367	36436	36359	36360	a woman	773	” The pretty clothes again . I thought some damn horrible thing was going to happen to me right there on his carpet . I could n't talk . I could n't move . I felt deathly sick . He really expected me to live like that , he looked at me and that 's what he saw , after eleven months . He expected me to start singing "
36445	36468	36443	36444	A Girl	2608	” right there in his Goddamned office . And a little buck - and - wing . And a little nigger shuffle . “
36477	36484	36443	36444	A Girl	2608	” I said . He said , “
36495	36655	36656	36656	Compromise	395	" I have n't the right hobbies , you see . My hobby is mathematics , not boys . And being young , too , that 's a drag . You have to take all kinds of crap . Boys do n't like smart girls . Boys do n't like aggressive girls . Unless they want to sit in the girls ' laps , that is . I never met a man yet who wanted to make it with a female Genghis Khan . Either they try to dominate you , which is revolting , or they turn into babies . You might as well give up . Then I had a lady shrink who said it was my problem because I was the one who was trying to rock the boat and you ca n't expect them to change . So I suppose I 'm the one who must change . Which is what my best friend said . “
36658	36671	36656	36656	Compromise	395	" she said , answering her fiftieth phone call of the night . “
36681	36804	36656	36656	Compromise	395	” Them ! Always Them , Them , Them . I ca n't just think of myself . My mother thinks that I do n't like boys , though I try to tell her : Look at it this way ; I 'll never lose my virginity . I 'm a Man - Hating Woman and 67 people leave the room when I come in it . Do they do the same for a Woman - Hating Man ? Do n't be silly . She 'll never know — nor would she credit if she knew — that men sometimes look very beautiful to me . From the depths , looking up . There was a very nice boy once who said , "
36822	36827	36813	36813	you	392	” And another with , “
36837	36842	36828	36828	You	392	” And a third , “
36852	37009	36848	36848	you	392	" My guts on the floor , you 're so beautiful when you 're angry . I want to be recognized . I 've never slept with a girl . I could n't . I would n't want to . That 's abnormal and I 'm not , although you ca n't be normal unless you do what you want and you ca n't be normal unless you love men . To do what I wanted would be normal , unless what I wanted was abnormal , in which case it would be abnormal to please myself and normal to do what I did n't want to do , which is n't normal . So you see . Dunyasha Bernadetteson ( the most brilliant mind in the world , b. A.C. 344 , d. A.C. 426 ) heard of this unfortunate young person and immediately pronounced the following shchasniy , or cryptic one - word saying : “
37012	37262	36848	36848	you	392	” XIII We persevered , reading magazines and covering the neighbors ' activities in the discreetest way possible , and Janet — who did n't believe us to be fully humankept her affections to herself . She got used to Laur 's standing by the door every time we went out in the 68 evening with a stubborn look on her face as if she were going to fling herself across the door with her arms spread out , movie style . But Laur controlled herself . Janet went out on a few arranged dates with local men but awe silenced them ; she learned nothing of the usual way such things were done . She went to a high school basketball game ( for the boys ) and a Fashion Fair ( for the girls ) . There was a Science Fair , whose misconceptions she enjoyed mightily . Like oil around water , the community parted to let us through . Laura Rose came up to Miss Evason one night as the latter sat reading alone in the living room ; it was February and the soft snow clung to the outside of the picture window . Picture windows in Anytown do not evaporate snow in the wintertime as windows do on Whileaway . Laur watched us standoffishly for a while , then came into the circle of fantasy and lamplight . She stood there , twisting her class ring around her finger . Then she said : “
37272	37273	37265	37265	you	1401	” "
37276	37298	37265	37265	you	1401	" said Janet . The soundless blows of the snowflakes against the glass . Laur sat down at Janet 's feet ( “
37305	37353	37300	37300	I	0	" ) and explained an old fantasy of hers , snow and forests and knights and lovelorn maidens . She said that to anyone in love the house would instantly seem submarine , not a house on Earth but a house on Titan under the ammonia snow . "
37359	37374	37354	37354	I	0	” she said , reviving that old story about the mythical man at school . "
37380	37460	37378	37378	Whileaway	237	” she added . Janet put down her magazine . Indirection is so new to Miss Evason that for a moment she does n't understand ; what Laur has said is : Tell me about your wife . Janet was pleased . She had traced Laur 's scheme not as concealment but as a kind of elaborate frivolity ; now she fell silent . The little girl sat tailor - fashion on the living room rug , watching us . “
37466	37495	37496	37496	She	1402	" said Laura Rose . Her features are delicate , not particularly marked ; she has a slightly indecently milky skin and lots of freckles . Knobby knuckles . “
37501	37624	37496	37496	She	1402	” said Janet - how crude , 69 once said!—and there goes something in Laura Rose 's heart , like the blows of something light but perpetually shocking : oh ! oh ! oh ! She reddened and said something very faintly , something I lip - read but did n't hear . Then she put her hand on Janet 's knee , a hot , moist hand with its square fingers and stubby nails , a hand of tremendous youthful presence , and said something else , still inaudible . Leave ! ( I told my compatriot ) First of all , it 's wrong . Second of all , it 's wrong . Third of all , it 's wrong . "
37629	37646	37496	37496	She	1402	” said Janet slowly , as she does sometimes , this being her favorite saying after , "
37652	37668	37647	37647	You	1403	” ( Performing the difficult mental trick of trying on somebody else 's taboos . ) "
37672	37676	37647	37647	You	1403	” she said , “
37683	38066	37647	37647	You	1403	” The little girl looked up . She is in the middle of something terribly distressing , something that will make her wring her hands , will make her cry . As a large Irish setter once bounded into my room and spent half the day unconsciously banging a piece of furniture with his tail ; so something awful has got into Laura Rose and is giving her electric shocks , terrifying blows , right across the heart . Janet took her by the shoulders and it got worse . There is this business of the narcissism of love , the fourth - dimensional curve that takes you out into the other who is the whole world , which is really a twist back into yourself , only a different self . Laur was weeping with despair . Janet pulled her up on to her lap - Janet 's lapas if she had been a baby ; everyone knows that if you start them young they 'll be perverted forever and everyone knows that nothing in the world is worse than making love to someone a generation younger than yourself . Poor Laura , defeated by both of us , her back bent , glazed and stupefied under the weight of a double taboo . Do n't , Janet . Do n't , Janet . Do n't exploit . That little girl 's sinister wisdom . Snow still blew across the side of the house ; the 70 walls shook , muffled . Something was wrong with the television set , or with the distance control , or perhaps some defective appliance somewhere in suburban Anytown sent out uncontrolled signals that no television set could resist ; for it turned itself on and gave us a television salad : Maureen trying unsuccessfully to slap John Wayne , a pretty girl with a drowned voice holding up a vaginal deodorant spray can , a house falling off the side of a mountain . Laur groaned aloud and hid her face against Janet 's shoulder . Janet-1 - held her , her odor flooding my skin , cold woman , grinning at my own desire because we are still trying to be good . Whileawayans , as has been said , love big asses . “
38075	38196	38073	38073	you	1404	" said Laur , and Janet rocked her , and Laur - not wishing to be taken for a child — bent Miss Evason 's head fiercely back against the chair and kissed her on the mouth . Oh my goodness . Janet 's rid of me . I sprang away and hung by one claw from the window curtain . Janet picked Laur up and deposited her on the floor , holding her tight through all the hysterics ; she nuzzled Laur 's ear and slipped off her own shoes . Laur came up out of it and threw the distance control at the television set , for the actress had been telling you to disinfect the little - mouse “
38200	38207	38212	38212	I	0	" and the set went dead . “
38218	38256	38212	38212	I	0	" wailed Laur . Better to cry . Businesslike Janet unfastened her shirt , her belt , and her blue jeans and gripped her about the hips , on the theory that nothing calms hysterics so fast . “
38259	38298	38212	38212	I	0	” said Laura Rose , astounded . This is the perfect time for her to change her mind . Her breathing grew quieter . Soberly she put her arms around Janet and leaned on Janet . She sighed . "
38309	38320	38299	38299	I	0	" said Janet , voice unaccountably breaking in the middle . "
38326	38399	38322	38322	you	1405	” Dearest , I ca n't because you are too young ; and some day soon you 'll look at me and my skin will be dead and dry , and being more romantically inclined than a Whileawayan , you 'll find me quite disgusting ; but until then I 'll do my best to conceal from you how very fond I am of you . There is also lust and I hope "
38402	38503	38510	38510	you	1406	" andling you to the televip out of it and 71 you understand me when I say I 'm about to die ; and I think we should go to a safer place where we can die in comfort , for example my room which has a lock on the door , because I do n't want to be panting away on the rug when your parents walk in . On Whileaway it would n't matter and you would n't have parents at your age , but here — or so I 'm told — things are as they are . “
38516	38573	38510	38510	you	1406	” Laur said . They climbed the stairs , Laur worrying a bit at her trailing pants . She bent down ( framed in the doorway ) to rub her ankles . She 's going to laugh in a minute and look at us from between her legs . She straightened up with a shy smile . "
38578	38592	38595	38595	child	2975	” she said in a hoarse , difficult whisper , averting her gaze . “
38601	38602	38599	38599	dear	1408	” “
38609	38722	38510	38510	you	1406	" XIV They undressed in Janet 's bedroom in the midst of her piles of material : books , magazines , sources of statistics , biographies , newspapers . The ghosts in the windowpanes undressed with them , for nobody could see in at the back of the house . Their dim and pretty selves . Janet pulled down the shades , lingering at each window and peering wistfully out into the dark , a shocking compound of familiar , friendly face and awful nude , while Laur climbed into Janet 's bed . The bedspread had holes in it where the pink satin had wom thin . She shut her eyes . "
38728	38729	38510	38510	you	1406	” “
38735	38778	38510	38510	you	1406	” said Janet , making the bed sway by getting into it . She held out her arms to the little girl ; then she kissed her on the shoulder , the Russian way . ( She 's the wrong shape . ) “
38786	38840	38779	38779	I	0	" said Laur and jumped out of bed to turn it off , but the air catches you on your bare skin before you get there and shocks you out of your senses ; so she stopped , mother - naked , with the currents of air investigating be- 72 tween her legs . "
38844	38859	38779	38779	I	0	” said Janet . The room is pitilessly well lit . Laur got back into bed—“Move
38861	38877	38510	38510	you	1406	" -and that awful sensation that you 're not going to enjoy it after all . “
38883	38888	38878	38878	You	0	" Janet said mildly , "
38895	38969	38878	38878	You	0	" and for a moment the preposterousness of it braced Laura Rose ; there could n't be any sex in it ; so she turned off the overhead light and got back into bed . Janet had turned on a rose - shaded night lamp by the bed . Miss Evason grew out of the satin cover , an antique statue from the waist up with preternaturally living eyes ; she said softly , “
38980	38991	38978	38978	we	1410	" indicating her round breasts , idealized by the dimness . “
38998	39098	38992	38992	I	0	" she said wickedly and Laur felt herself go red all over , so unpleasant was the picture of Yuriko Janetson being held up to one breast to suck , not , it seemed to Laur , an uncollected , starry - eyed infant but some thing like a miniature adult , on a ladder perhaps . Laur lay stiffily back and shut her eyes , radiating refusal . Janet turned out the bedside light . Miss Evason then pulled the covers up around her shoulders , sighed in self - control , and ordered Laur to turn over . “
39112	39113	39099	39099	You	1412	” “
39116	39132	39099	39099	You	1412	” she said sincerely , when she began on the muscles of Laura 's neck . "
39137	39201	39099	39099	You	1412	” Laura tried to giggle . Miss Evason 's voice , in the darkness , went on and on : about the last few weeks , about studying freshwater ponds on Whileaway , a hard , lean , sexless greyhound of a voice ( Laur thought ) which betrayed Laura in the end , Miss Evason stating with an odd , unserious chuckle , “
39204	39205	39206	39206	I	0	” “
39211	39391	39206	39206	I	0	” Laur said , ready to weep . There is propaganda and propaganda and I represented again to Janet that what she was about to do was a serious crime . God will punish , I said . You are supposed to make them giggle , but Janet remembered how she herself had been at twelve , and oh it 's so serious . She kissed Laura Rose lightly on the lips over and over again until Laura caught her head ; in the dark it was n't really so bad and Laura could imagine that she was nobody , or that Miss Evason was 13 nobody , or that she was imagining it all . One nice thing to do is rub from the neck down to the tail , it renders the human body ductile and makes the muscles purr . Without knowing it , Laur was in over her head . She had learned from a boy friend how to kiss on top , but here there was lots of time and lots of other places ; “
39396	39403	39206	39206	I	0	” said Laura Rose in surprise ; “
39409	39487	39206	39206	I	0	” and the sound of her own voice sent her in head over heels . Janet found the little bump Whileawayans call The Key — Now you must make an effort , she said and with the sense of working very hard , Laur finally tumbled off the cliff . It was incompletely and desperately inadequate , but it was the first major sexual pleasure she had ever received from another human being in her entire life . “

Her mother went up into the woods pregnant ( for there were more woods than there are today ) and gave birth to the child there , for she had made an error in reckoning . Also , she had got lost . Why she was in the woods does n't matter . It is not germane to this story . “
48397	48398	48448	48448	she	2977	” “

48510	48903	48501	48503	the little girl	709	“ When she was ten , there began to be trouble . She had some bear friends by then , although she did n't like to walk on all - fours as the bears did and the bears did n't like that , because bears are very conservative . She argued that walking on all - fours did n't suit her skeletal development . The bears said , ' Oh , but we have always walked this way . They were pretty stupid . But nice , I mean . Anyway , she walked upright , the way it felt best , but when it came to copulation , that was another matter . There was nobody to copulate with . The little girl wanted to try it with her male - best - bear - friend ( for animals do not live the way people do , you know ) but the be - bear would not even try . ' Alas ' he said ( You can tell by that he was much more elegant than the other bears , ha ha ) I 'm afraid I 'd hurt you with my claws because you do n't have all the fur that she - bears have . And besides that , you have trouble assuming the proper position because your back legs are too long . And besides that , you do n't smell like a bear and I 'm afraid my Mother would say it was bestiality . ' That 's a joke . Actually it 's race prejudice . The little girl was very lonely and bored . Finally after a long time , she browbeat her bear - mother into telling her about her origins , so she decided to go out looking for some people who were not bears . She thought life might be better with them . She said good - bye to her bear - friends and started South , and they all wept and waved their handkerchiefs . The girl was very hardy and woodswise , since she had been taught by the bears . She traveled all day and slept all night . Finally she came to a settlement of people , just like this one , and they took her in . Of course she did n't speak people - talk ”
48912	49165	48501	48503	the little girl	709	" and they did n't speak bearish . This was a big problem . Eventually she learned their language so she could talk to them and when they found out she had been raised by bears , they directed her to the Geddes Regional Park where she spent a great deal 97 of time speaking bearish to the scholars . She made friends and so had plenty of people to copulate with , but on moonlit nights she longed to be back with the bears , for she wanted to do the great bear dances , which bears do under the full moon . So eventually she went back North again . But it turned out that the bears were a bore . So she decided to find her human mother . At the flats to Rabbit Island she found a statue with an inscription that said , ' Go that way , ' so she did . At the exit from the bridge to North Continent she found an arrow sign that had been overturned , so she followed in the new direction it was pointing . The Spirit of Chance was tracking her . At the entry into Green Bay she found a huge goldfish bowl barring her way , which turned into the Spirit of Chance , a very very old woman with tiny , dried - up legs , sitting on top of a wall . The wall stretched all the way across the forty - eighth parallel . “
49179	49197	49174	49177	the Spirit of Chance	422	“ Not on your life , ' said the little girl , who was nobody 's fool . “
49256	49264	49233	49233	she	1416	“ She was connected with a computer ! “

49534	49544	49530	49530	I	0	” said my dignified little friend ( through Vittoria ) “
49550	49596	49530	49530	I	0	” and slipping her head under the induction helmet without further comment ( and her hands into the waldoes ) she went back to stirring her blanc - mange with her forefinger . She said something casually over her shoulder to Vittoria , who translated : “
49604	49609	49530	49530	I	0	” ( said Vittoria ) “

XI Some homes are extruded foam : white caves hung with veils of diamonds , indoor gardens , ceilings that weep . There are places in the Arctic to sit and meditate , invisible walls that shut in the same ice as outside , the same clouds . There is one rain - forest , there is one shallow sea , there is one mountain chain , there is one desert . Human rookeries asleep undersea where Whileawayans create , in their leisurely way , a new economy and a new race . Rafts anchored in the blue eye of a dead volcano . Eyries built for nobody in particular , whose guests arrive by glider . There are many more shelters than homes , many more homes than persons ; as the saying goes , My home is in my shoes . Everything ( they know ) is eternally in transit . Everything is pointed toward death . Radar dish - ears listen for whispers from outside . There is no pebble , no tile , no 99 excrement , that is not Tao ; Whileaway is inhabited by the pervasive spirit of underpopulation , and alone at twilight in the permanently deserted city that is only a jungle of sculptured forms set on the Altiplano , attending to the rush of one 's own breath in the respiratory mask , thenI gambled for chores and breakfast with an old , old woman , in the middle of the night by the light of an alcohol lamp , somewhere on the back roads of the swamp and pine flats of South Continent . Watching the shadows dance on her wrinkled face , I understood why other women speak with awe of seeing the withered legs dangling from the shell of a computer housing : Humpty Dumptess on her way to the ultimate Inside of things . ( I lost . I carried her baggage and did her chores for a day . ) An ancient statue outside the fuel - alcohol distillery at Ciudad Sierra : a man seated on a stone , his knees spread , both hands pressed against the pit of his stomach , a look of blind distress , face blurred by time . Some wag has carved on the base the sideways eight that means infinity and added a straight line down from the middle ; this is both the Whileaway schematic of the male genital and the mathematical symbol for self - contradiction . If you are so foolhardy as to ask a Whileawayan child to “
50082	50089	50079	50082	a good girl ”	3527	” and do something for you : “
50106	50116	50102	50104	a good girl	2880	“ Why ca n't you run your own errands ? "
50121	50628	50102	50104	a good girl	2880	" ( The double pairs of hard , dark children 's eyes everywhere , like mating cats ' . ) 100 A quiet country night . The hills East of Green Bay , the wet heat of August during the day . One woman reads ; another sews ; another smokes . Some body takes from the wall a kind of whistle and plays on it the four notes of the major chord . This is repeated over and over again . We hold on to these four notes as long as possible ; then we transform them by one note ; again we repeat these four notes . Slowly something tears itself away from the not - melody . Distances between the harmonics stretch wider and wider . No one is dancing tonight . How the lines open up ! Three notes now . The playfulness and terror of the music written right on the air . Although the player is employing nearly the same dynamics throughout , the sounds have become painfully loud ; the little instrument 's guts are coming out . Too much to listen to , with its lips right against my ear . I believe that by dawn it will stop , by dawn we will have gone through six or seven changes of notes , maybe two in an hour . By dawn we 'll know a little something about the major triad . We 'll have celebrated a little something . How Whileawayans Celebrate Dorothy Chiliason in the forest glade , her moongreen pajamas , big eyes , big shoulders , her broad lips and big breasts , each with its protruding thumb , her aureole of fuzzy , ginger - colored hair . She springs to her feet and listens . One hand up in the air , thinking . Then both hands up . She shakes her head . She takes a glid- 101 ing step , dragging one foot . Then again . Again . She takes on some extra energy and runs a little bit . Then stops . She thinks a little bit . Whileawayan celebratory dancing is not like Eastern dancing with its motions in toward the body , its cushions of warm air exhaled by the dancer , its decorations by contradictory angles ( leg up , knee down , foot up ; one arm up - bent , the other arm down - bent ) . Nor is it at all like the yearning - forflight of Western ballet , limbs shooting out in heavenaspiring curves , the torso a mathematical point . If Indian dancing says I Am , if ballet says I Wish , what does the dance of Whileaway say ? It says I Guess . ( The intellectuality of this impossible business ! ) What Whileawayans Celebrate The full moon The Winter solstice ( You have n't lived if you have n't seen us running around in our skivvies , banging on pots and pans , shouting “
50642	50888	50079	50082	a good girl ”	3527	" ) The Summer solstice ( rather different ) The autumnal equinox The vernal equinox The flowering of trees The flowering of bushes The planting of seeds Happy copulation Unhappy copulation Longing Jokes Leaves falling off the trees ( where deciduous ) Acquiring new shoes Wearing same Birth 102 The contemplation of a work of art Marriages Sport Divorces Anything at all Nothing at all Great ideas Death There is an unpolished , white , marble statue of God on Rabbit Island , all alone in a field of weeds and snow . She is seated , naked to the waist , an outsized female figure as awful as Zeus , her dead eyes staring into nothing . At first She is majestic ; then I notice that Her cheekbones are too broad , Her eyes set at different levels , that Her whole figure is a jumble of badlymatching planes , a mass of inhuman contradictions . There is a distinct resemblance to Dunyasha Bernadetteson , known as The Playful Philosopher ( A.C. 344_426 ) , though God is older than Bernadetteson and it 's possible that Dunyasha 's genetic surgeon modelled her after God instead of the other way round . Persons who look at the statue longer than I did have reported that one can not pin It down at all , that She is a constantly changing contradiction , that She becomes in turn gentle , terrifying , hateful , loving , "
50890	50893	50079	50082	a good girl ”	3527	" ( or "
50895	51052	50079	50082	a good girl ”	3527	” ) and finally indescribable . Persons who look at Her longer than that have been known to vanish right off the face of the Earth . XVII I have never been to Whileaway . Whileawayans breed into themselves an immunity 103 to ticks , mosquitoes , and other insect parasites . I have none . And the way into Whileaway is barred neither by time , distance , nor an angel with a flaming sword , but by a cloud or crowd of gnats . Talking gnats . 104 PART SIX Jeannine wakes from a dream of Whileaway . She has to go to her brother 's this week . Everything suggests to Jeannine something she has lost , although she does n't put it to herself this way ; what she understands is that everything in the world wears a faint coating of nostalgia , makes her cry , seems to say to her , "
51057	51879	51053	51053	You	1806	” She 's fond of not being able to do things ; somehow this gives her a right to something . Her eyes fill with tears . Everything 's a cheat . If she gets up right now , she 'll be able to make the early bus ; she also wants to get away from the dream that still lingers in the folds of her bedclothes , in the summery smell of her soft old sheets , a smell of herself that Jeannine likes but would n't admit to anybody . The bed is full of dreamy , suspicious hollows . Jeannine yawns , out of a sense of duty . She gets up and makes the bed , then picks paperback books up off the floor ( murder mysteries ) and puts them away in her bookcase . There are clothes to wash before she goes , clothes to put away , stockings to pair and put in the drawers . She wraps the garbage in newspaper and carries it down three flights to put it in the garbage can . She routs Cal 's socks from behind the bed and shakes them out , leaving them on the kitchen table . There are dishes to wash , soot on the window sills , soaking pots to scour , a dish to put under the radiator in case it goes on during the week ( it leaks ) . Oh . Ugh . Let the windows go , though Cal does n't like them dirty . That awful job of scrubbing out the toilet , whisk - brooming the furniture . Clothes to 105 iron . Things always fall off when you straighten other things . She bends and bends . Flour and sugar spill on the shelves over the sink and have to be mopped up ; there are stains and spills , rotting radish leaves , and encrustations of ice inside the old refrigerator ( it has to be propped open with a chair to defrost itself ) . Odds and ends of paper , candy , cigarettes , cigarette ashes all over the room . Everything has to be dusted . She decides to do the windows anyway , because it 's nice . They 'll be filthy in a week . Of course nobody else helps . Nothing is the right height . She adds Cal 's socks to her clothes and his clothes that she has to take to the selfservice laundry , makes a separate pile of his clothes that have to be mended , and sets the table for herself . She scrapes old food from her cat 's dish into the garbage , washes the dish , and sets out new water and milk . Mr. Frosty does n't seem to be around . Under the sink Jeannine finds a dishcloth , hangs it up over the sink , reminds herself to clean out under there later , and pours out cold cereal , tea , toast , orange juice . ( The orange juice is a government package of powdered orange - and - grapefruit and tastes awful . ) She jumps up to rummage around for the mop head under the sink , and the galvanized pail , also somewhere down in there . Time to mop the bathroom floor and the square of linoleum in front of the sink and stove . First she finishes her tea , leaves half the orange - and - grapefruit juice ( making a face ) and some of the cereal . Milk goes back in the refrigerator - no , wait a minute , throw it outshe sits down for a moment and writes out a list of gro ceries to buy on the way back from the bus in a week . Fill the pail , find the soap , give up , mop it anyway with just water . Put everything away . Do the breakfast dishes . She picks up a murder mystery and sits on the couch , riffling through it . Jump up , wash the table , pick up the salt that falls on the rug and brush it up with the whisk - broom . Is that all ? No , mend Cal 's clothes and her own . Oh , let them be . She has to pack and make her lunch and Cal 's ( although he 's not going with her ) . That means things coming out of the icebox again and mopping the table again — leaving footprints on the linoleum again . Well , it does n't matter . Wash the knife 106 and the plate . Done . She decides to go get the sewing box to do his clothes , then changes her mind . Instead she picks up the murder mystery . Cal will say , “
51887	52888	51880	51880	You	1807	” She goes to get the sewing box out of the back of the closet , stepping over her valises , boxes of stuff , the ironing board , her winter coat and winter clothes . Little hands reach out of Jeannine 's back and pick up what she drops . She sits on her couch , fixing the rip in his summer suit jacket , biting off the thread with her front teeth . You 'll chip the enamel . Buttons . Mending three socks . ( The others seem all right . ) Rubbing the small of her back . Fastening the lining of a skirt where it 's torn . Inspecting her stockings for runs . Polishing shoes . She pauses and looks at nothing . Then she shakes herself and with an air of extraordinary energy gets her middling - sized valise from the closet and starts laying out her clothes for the week . Cal wo n't let me smoke . He really cares about me . With everything cleaned up , she sits and looks at her room . The Post says you should get cobwebs off the ceiling with a rag tied to a broom handle . Well , I ca n't see them . Jeannine wishes for the shedoesn't - know - how - many - times time that she had a real apartment with more than one room , though to decorate it properly would be more than she could afford . There 's a pile of home - decorating magazines in the back of the closet , although that was only a temporary thing ; the thought does n't really recur to her much . Cal does n't understand about such things . Tall , dark , and handsome . ... She refused her lover . ... the noble thing to . ... mimosa and jasmine . ... She thinks how it would be to be a mermaid and decorate a merhouse with seaweed and slices of pearl . The Mermaid 's Companion . The Mermaid 's Home Journal . She giggles . She finishes packing her clothes , taking out a pair of shoes to polish them with a bottle of neutral polish , because you have to be careful with the light colors . As soon as they dry , they 'll go back in the valise . Trouble is , though , the valise is bloody well falling apart at the seams . Cal , when he comes , will find her reading Mademoiselle Mermaid about the new fish - scale look for eyes . 107 Why does she keep having these dreams about Whileaway ? While - away . While . A. Way . To While away the time . That means it 's just a pastime . If she tells Cal about it , he 'll say she 's nattering again ; worse still , it would sound pretty silly ; you ca n't expect a man to listen to everything ( as everybody 's Mother said ) . Jeannine gets dressed in blouse , sweater , and skirt for her brother 's place in the country , while in the valise she puts : a pair of slacks to go berrying in , another blouse , a scarf , underwear , stockings , a jacket ( No , r'll carry it ) , her hairbrush , her makeup , face cream , sanitary napkins , a raincoat , jewelry for the good dress , hair clips , hair curlers , bathing suit , and a light every day dress . Oof , too heavy ! She sits down again , discouraged . Little things make Jeannine blue . What 's the use of cleaning a place over and over again if you ca n't make something of it ? The ailanthus tree nods to her from outside the window . ( And why wo n't Cal protect her against anything ? She deserves protection . ) Maybe she 'll meet somebody . Nobody knows - O nobody knows really - what 's in Jeannine 's heart ( she thinks ) . But somebody will see . Somebody will understand . Remember the hours in California under the fig tree . Jeannine in her crisp plaid dress , the hint of fall in the air , the blue haze over the hills like smoke . She hauls at the valise again , wondering desperately what it is that other women know and can do that she does n't know or ca n't do , women in the street , women in the magazines , the ads , married women . Why life does n't match the stories . I ought to get married . ( But not to Cal ! ) She 'll meet someone on the bus ; she 'll sit next to someone . Who knows why things happen ? Jeannine , who sometimes believes in astrology , in palmistry , in occult signs , who knows that certain things are fated or not fated , knows that men in spite of everything — have no contact with or understanding of the insides of things . That 's a realm that 's denied them . Women 's magic , women 's intuition rule here , the subtle deftness forbid den to the clumsier sex . Jeannine is on very good terms with her ailanthus tree . Without having to reflect on it , without having to work at it , they both bring into hu- 108 man life the breath of magic and desire . They merely embody . Mr. Frosty , knowing he 's going to be left at a neighbor 's for the week , has been hiding behind the couch ; now he crawls out with a piece of dust stuck on his left eye - tuft , looking very miserable . Jeannine has no idea what drove him out . "
52892	53079	51880	51880	You	1807	” There was something about her . She watches the blotchy - skinnycat ( as Cal calls him ) sneak to his milk dish and while Mr. Frosty laps it up , Jeannine grabs him . She gets the collar around his neck while Mr. Frosty struggles indignantly , and then she snaps the leash on . In a few minutes he 'll forget he 's confined . He 'll take the collar for granted and start daydreaming about sumptuous mice . There was something unforgettable about her .... She ties him to a bed post and pauses , catching sight of herself in the wall mirror : flushed , eyes sparkling , her hair swept back as if by some tumultuous storm , her whole face glowing . The lines of her figure are perfect , but who is to use all this loveliness , who is to recognize it , make it public , make it available ? Jeannine is not available to Jeannine . She throws her jacket over one arm , more depressed than otherwise . I wish I had money . ... "
53084	53090	53091	53092	Some body	3531	” she tells the cat . “
53098	53165	53091	53092	Some body	3531	” She arranges her jacket , her valise , and her pocketbook , and turns off the light , shutting the door behind her ( it latches itself ) . If only ( she thinks ) he 'll come and show me to myself . I 've been waiting for you so long . How much longer must I wait ? Nights and nights alone . ( “
53170	53175	53176	53176	You	1810	” says the stairwell . “
53180	53618	53176	53176	You	1810	" says the street . ) A fragment of old song drifts through her mind and lingers behind her in the stairwell , her thoughts lingering there , too , wishing that she could be a mermaid and float instead of walk , that she were someone else and so could watch herself coming down the stairs , the beautiful girl who composes everything around her to harmony : Somebody lovely has just passed by . 109 I live between worlds . Half the time I like doing housework , I care a lot about how I look , I warm up to men and flirt beautifully ( I mean I really admire them , though I 'd die before I took the initiative ; that 's men 's business ) , I do n't press my point in conversations , and I enjoy cooking . I like to do things for other people , especially male people . I sleep well , wake up on the dot , and do n't dream . There 's only one thing wrong with me : I 'm frigid . In my other incarnation I live out such a plethora of conflict that you would n't think I 'd survive , would you , but I do ; I wake up enraged , go to sleep in numbed despair , face what I know perfectly well is condescension and abstract contempt , get into quarrels , shout , fret about people I do n't even know , live as if I were the only woman in the world trying to buck it all , work like a pig , strew my whole apartment with notes , articles , manuscripts , books , get frowsty , do n't care , be come stridently contentious , sometimes laugh and weep within five minutes together out of pure frustration . It takes me two hours to get to sleep and an hour to wake up . I dream at my desk . I dream all over the place . I 'm very badly dressed . But o how I relish my victuals ! And O how I fuck ! Jeannine has an older brother who 's a mathematics teacher in a New York high school . Their mother , who stays with him during vacations , was widowed when Jeannine was four . When she was a little baby 110 R ESOURCE Jeannine used to practice talking ; she would get into a corner by herself and say words over and over again to get them right . Her first full sentence was , “
53623	53711	53176	53176	You	1810	” She pressed wildflowers and wrote poems in elementary school . Jeannine 's brother , her sister - in - law , their two children , and her mother live for the summer in two cottages near a lake . Jeannine will stay in the smaller one with her mother . She comes downstairs with me behind her to find Mrs. Dadier arranging flowers in a pickle jar on the kitchenette table . I am behind Jeannine , but Jeannine ca n't see me , of course . “
53718	53732	53712	53712	Everyone	1161	” says Mrs. Dadier , giving her daughter a peck on the cheek . “
53735	53756	53712	53712	Everyone	1161	” says Jeannine , still sleepy . I duck behind the bookshelves that separate the living room from the kitchenette . “
53770	53793	53759	53759	you	1812	” says Mrs. Dadier , setting cereal and sulky impassivity . I make an awful face , which of course nobody sees . “
53798	53804	53759	53759	you	1812	” says Jeannine , untruly . “
53807	53818	53759	53759	you	1812	” says Mrs. Dadier , her blue eyes opening wide . “
53826	53849	53824	53824	him	1814	" He was impotent , mother . Now how could I say that to such a nice lady ? I did n't . "
53852	53856	53824	53824	him	1814	” says Jeannine . "
53861	53862	53859	53859	Bro	430	” "
53865	53915	53916	53916	We	1813	” says Mrs. Dadier . Brother often goes out in the early morning and meditates over a fishing line . The ladies do n't . Mrs. Dadier is afraid of his slipping , falling on a rock , and splitting open his head . Jeannine does n't like fishing . “
53925	53930	53916	53916	We	1813	” says Mrs. Dadier . “
53950	53986	53948	53948	Jeannine	406	” With her perpetually fresh smile Mrs. Dadier clears off the table where her daughter - in - law and the two children have breakfasted earlier ; Eileen has her hands full with the children . "
53992	53999	53990	53990	mother	1136	” says Jeannine , looking down . “
54005	54010	54000	54000	I	0	” says Mrs. Dadier . “
54021	54033	54034	54034	You	406	” Listless Jeannine pushes her 111 chair back from the table . “
54039	54056	54034	54034	You	406	” ob serves Mrs. Dadier , mildly surprised . We have to get out of here . “
54068	54075	54066	54066	Bro	430	" says Jeannine , edging out , “
54080	54203	54076	54076	THI	1817	" and she 's gone . Mrs. Dadier does n't smile when there 's nobody there . Mother and daughter wear the same face at times like that - calm and deathly tired Jeannine idly pulling the heads off weeds at the side of the path with an abstract viciousness completely unconnected with anything going on in her head . Mrs. Dadier finishes the dishes and sighs . That 's done . Always to do again . Jeannine comes to the path around the lake , the great vacation feature of the community , and starts round it , but there seems to be nobody nearby . She had hoped she would find her brother , who was always her favorite . ( “
54207	54393	54478	54478	Bud	435	" ) She sits on the rock by the side of the path , Jeannine the baby . Out in the lake there 's a single canoe with two people in it ; Jeannine 's gaze , vaguely resentful , fastens on it for a moment , and then drifts off . Her sister - in - law is worried sick about one of the children ; one of those children always has something . Jeannine bangs her knuckles idly on the rock . She 's too sour for a romantic reverie and soon she gets up and walks on . Whoever comes to the lake anyway ? Maybe Bro is at home . She retraces her steps and takes a fork off the main path , idling along until the lake , with its crowded fringe of trees and brush , disappears behind her . Eileen Dadier 's youngest , the little girl , appears at the upstairs window for a moment and then vanishes . Bro is behind the cottage , cleaning fish , protecting his sports clothes with a rubber lab apron . "
54397	54401	54478	54478	Bud	435	” says Jeannine . "
54404	54444	54478	54478	Bud	435	” She leans forward with her arms pulled back to avoid getting fish scales on herself , one cheek offered invitingly . Her brother kisses her . Eileen appears around the corner of the house , leading the boy . “
54448	54452	54446	54446	Auntie	434	” she says . “
54463	54464	54461	54461	Jeannie	328	” "
54467	54474	54465	54465	Jeannine	406	” says Jeannine ( automatically ) . “
54480	54484	54478	54478	Bud	435	” says Eileen . "
54500	54602	54494	54494	you	435	” Jeannine nods . Jeannine 's nephew , who does n't like anyone but his father , is pulling furiously at Eileen Dadier 's hand , 112 trying seriously to get his fingers out of hers . Bud finishes cleaning the fish . He wipes his hands methodically on a dish towel which Eileen will have to wash by hand to avoid contaminating her laundry , takes off his coat , and takes his knife and cleaver into the house , from whence comes the sound of running water . He comes out again , drying his hands on a towel . "
54607	54616	54620	54620	Auntie	434	” says Eileen Dadier reproachfully to her son , "
54622	54642	54643	54643	Jeannie	328	” Jeannine 's brother takes his son 's hand from his wife . The little boy immediately stops wriggling . "
54645	54649	54643	54643	Jeannie	328	” he says . "
54657	54664	54655	54655	you	328	“ When did you get in ? “
54673	54697	54698	54698	They	1821	” I found Jeannine on the clubhouse porch that evening , looking at the moon . She had run away from her family . “
54707	54715	54716	54716	They	1821	” I said . She made a face “
54720	54741	54716	54716	They	1821	” I said . A low , strangled sound . She was prodding the porch - rail with her hand . "
54754	54758	54752	54752	Jeannine	406	” I said . “
54849	54850	54847	54847	Jeannine	406	" "
54854	54868	54869	54869	Jeannine	406	" said Jeannine softly and precisely . Or perhaps she said Oh no . "
54879	54883	54869	54869	Jeannine	406	” I said . “
54997	54998	54995	54995	Jeannine	406	" "
55003	55013	54995	54995	Jeannine	406	” said she . Or was it Not fair ? "
55023	55033	55015	55021	someone who can take care of you	1836	” I went on , for her own good . “
55099	55127	55129	55129	Cal	287	” ( Brief flash of waxed floor , wife in organdie apron , smiling possessively , husband with roses . That 's hers , not mine . ) “
55131	55136	55129	55129	Cal	287	” Ah , hell . “
55147	55155	55143	55143	you	406	” ( I was getting impatient . ) "
55220	55221	55213	55213	you	406	” "
55226	55284	55213	55213	you	406	” said Jeannine . For a plan . My impression that somebody else had been echoing her was confirmed by a brief cough behind me after these words . But it turned out to be Mr. Dadier , come out to fetch his sister . He took her by the arm and pulled her toward the door . “
55299	55476	55297	55297	someone	885	” Only the woman revealed under the light was not Jeannine . A passerby inside saw the substitution through the doorway and gaped . Nobody else seemed to notice . Jeannine is still meditating by the rail : doctor , lawyer , Indian chief , poor man , rich man ; maybe he 'll be tall ; maybe he 'll make twenty thou a year ; maybe he 'll speak three languages and be really sophisticated , maybe . Mister Destiny . Janet , who has none of our notion that a good , dignified , ladylike look will re- 114 call the worst of scoundrels to a shrinking consciousness of his having insulted A Lady ( that 's the general idea , anyway ) , has gotten out of Bud Dadier 's hold by twisting his thumb . She is the victim of a natural , but ignorant and unjustified alarm ; she thinks that being grabbed is not just a gesture but is altogether out of line . Janet 's prepared for blue murder . "
55479	55489	55297	55297	someone	885	” says Bro . He 's about to expostulate . "
55500	55536	55492	55492	you	1853	” Touch me again and I 'll knock your teeth out ! You can see the blood rush to his face , even in this bad light . That 's what comes of being misunderstood . “
55548	55552	55553	55553	You	1853	” Janet jeers . "
55556	55585	55586	55586	Bud	435	" Bud Dadier begins , but Janet anticipates him by vanishing like a soap bubble . What do you think Bud stands for - Buddington ? Budworthy ? Or "
55587	55590	55591	55592	friend "	3693	” as in "
55592	55654	55657	55657	Bro	430	" ? He passes his hands over his face — the only thing left of Janet is a raucous screech of triumph which nobody else ( except the two of us ) can hear . The woman in front of the door is Jeannine . Bro , scared out of his wits , as who would n't be , grabs her . “
55659	55668	55657	55657	Bro	430	” says Jeannine reproachfully , rubbing her arm . “
55678	55682	55669	55669	You	1855	” says he . "

59343	59379	59339	59339	you	406	” said Eileen , laughing . Jeannine had been shocked right out of her sorrow . She turned to her sister - in - law and said , with unwonted energy , between her teeth : “

59657	59677	59655	59655	Jeannie	328	” and kissed her . Bud gave her a peck on the cheek . Do n't you touch me ! “
59682	59693	59694	59694	I	0	" said X , when Bud and Eileen had gone .. "
59699	59709	59655	59655	Jeannie	328	” said Jeannine , almost under her 124 breath , “

59801	60373	59752	59752	I	0	” he said . Score one . That radiant look of gratitude . Maybe she 'll react the same way when he tells her he can ski . In this loveliest and neatest of social interactions , she admires him , he 's pleased with her admiration , this pleasure lends him warmth and style , he relaxes , he genuinely likes Jeannine ; Jeannine sees this and something stirs , something hopes afresh . Is he The One ? Can he Change Her Life ? ( Do you know what you want ? No . Then do n't complain . ) Fleeing from the unspeakableness of her own wishes for what happens when you find out you want something that does n't exist2_Jeannine lands in the lap of the possible . A drowning woman , she takes X 's willing , merman hands ; maybe it 's wanting to get married , maybe she 's just waited too long . There 's love ; there 's joy — in marriage , and you must take your chances as they come . They say life without love does strange things to you ; maybe you begin to doubt love 's existence . I shouted at her and beat her on the back and on the head ; oh I was an enraged and evil spirit there in the theatre lobby , but she continued holding poor X by the hands little did he know what hopes hung on him as she continued ( I say ) to hold on to his hands and look into his flattered eyes . Little did she know that he was a water - dweller and would drown her . Little did she know that there was , attached to his back , a drowning - machine issued him in his teens along with his pipe and his tweeds and his ambition and his profession and his father 's mannerisms . Somewhere is The One . The solution . Fulfillment . Fulfilled women . Filled full . My Prince . Come . Come away , Death . She stumbles into her Mommy 's shoes , little girl playing house . I could kick her . And X thinks , poor , deceived bastard , that it 's a tribute to him , of all people as if he had any- 125 thing to do with it ! ( I still do n't know whom she saw or thought she saw in the mirror . Was it Janet ? Me ? ) I want to get married . VIII Men succeed . Women get married . Men fail . Women get married . Men enter monasteries . Women get married . Men start wars . Women get married . Men stop them . Women get married . Dull , dull . ( see below ) Jeannine came around to her brother 's house the next morning , just for fun . She had set her hair and was wearing a swanky scarf over the curlers . Both Mrs. Dadier and Jeannine know that there 's nothing in a breakfast nook to make it intrinsically interesting for thirty years ; nonetheless Jeannine giggles and twirls the drinking straw in her breakfast Cocoa fancifully this way and that . It 's the kind of straw that has a pleated section in the middle like the bellows of a concertina . “
60385	60389	60374	60374	I	0	” Jeannine says . "
60398	60426	60396	60396	you	0	” says Mrs. Dadier , who is sitting with her second cup of coffee before attacking the dishes . Jeannine gives way to a fit of hysterics . “
60432	60436	60428	60428	you	0	” she cries . “
60442	60443	60439	60439	you	0	" “
60448	60453	60439	60439	you	0	” says Mrs. Dadier . “
60460	60467	60456	60456	I	0	” They sit , saying nothing . “
60472	60505	60469	60469	Frank	450	” This is Mrs. Dadier , carefully 126 keeping her voice neutral because she knows how Jeannine hates interference in her own affairs . Jeannine makes a face and then laughs again . "
60514	60518	60512	60512	Mother	1136	" she says . “
60525	60541	60542	60542	Bro	430	” She seems to see the funny side of it more than Mrs. Dadier does . "
60544	60549	60555	60555	Eileen	433	” says the latter , "
60577	60578	60579	60579	I	0	" "
60586	60598	60599	60599	I	0	” says Jeannine , aggrieved . ( She 's lying . ) "
60647	60681	60643	60643	your	1136	" The sun has gone in again . When Bud is n't around , there 's Jeannie to watch out for ; Mrs. Dadier tries to anticipate her wishes and not disturb her . “
60688	60693	60684	60684	I	0	” says Mrs. Dadier . “
60714	60860	60699	60699	Bud	435	” It does n't work . Jeannine , slightly sulky , attacks her toast and jam , cramming a piece into her mouth cater - cornered . Jam drops on the table . Jeannine , implacably convicted of getting up late , is taking it out on the table - cloth . Getting up late is wallowing in sin . It 's unforgivable . It 's improper . Mrs. Dadier , with the misplaced courage of the doomed , chooses to ignore the jam stains and get on with the really important question , viz . , is Jeannine going to have a kitchenette of her own ( although it will really belong to someone else , wo n't it ) and is she going to be made to get up early , i.e. , Get Married . Mrs. Dadier says very carefully and placatingly : "
60871	60897	60864	60864	you	2942	” but this morning , instead of flinging off in a rage , her daughter kisses her on the top of the head and announces , "
60905	60906	60864	60864	you	2942	” “
60911	60917	60864	60864	you	2942	” says Mrs. Dadier deprecatingly ; "
60929	60953	60924	60924	I	0	” Jeannine winks at her . She feels virtuous ( because of the dishes ) and daring ( because of something else ) . “
60961	61292	60924	60924	I	0	” she says , sauntering into the living room . Not doing the dishes . She sits herself down in the rattan chair and twirls the pencil her mother always keeps by 127 the telephone pad . She draws flowers on the pad and the profiles of girls whose eyes are nonetheless in fullface . Should she call X ? Should she wait for X to call her ? When he calls , should she be effusive or reserved ? Comradely or distant ? Should she tell X about Cal ? If he asks her out for tonight , should she refuse ? Where will she go if she does ? She ca n't possibly call him , of course . But suppose she rings up Mrs. Dadier 's friend with a message ? My mother asked me to tell you . ... Jeannine 's hand is actually on the telephone receiver when she notices that the hand is shaking : a sportswoman 's eagerness for the chase . She laughs under her breath . She picks up the phone , trembling with eagerness , and dials X 's number ; it 's happening at last . Everything is going well . Jeannine has almost in her hand the brass ring which will entitle her to everything worthwhile in life . It 's only a question of time before X decides ; surely she can keep him at arm 's length until then , keep him fascinated ; there 's so much time you can take up with will - she - won't - she , so that hardly anything else has to be settled at all . She feels something for him , she really does . She wonders when the reality of it begins to hit you . Off in telephone never - neverland someone picks up the receiver , interrupting the last ring , footsteps approach and recede , someone is clearing their throat into the mouthpiece . “
61295	61321	60924	60924	I	0	” ( It 's his mother . ) Jeannine glibly repeats the fake message she has practiced in her head ; X 's mother says , "
61333	61339	61330	61331	Jeannine Dadier	406	” Horror . More footsteps . "
61342	61345	61330	61331	Jeannine Dadier	406	” says X. "
61361	61365	61353	61353	I	0	" says Jeannine . "
61368	61391	61353	61353	I	0	" says X , pleased . This is even more than she has a right to expect , according to the rules . "
61403	61480	61394	61394	I	0	" says Jeannine , drawing irritable , jagged lines across her doodles on the telephone pad . She keeps trying to think of the night before , but all she can remember is Bud playing with his youngest daughter , the only time she 's ever seen her brother get foolish . He bounces her on his knee and gets red in the face , swinging her about 128 his head while she screams with delight . “
61498	61537	61487	61488	Silly Sally	370	” Eileen usually rescues the baby on the grounds that she 's getting too excited . For some reason this whole memory causes Jeannine great pain and she can hardly keep her mind on what she 's saying . “
61545	61577	61538	61538	I	0	” says Jeannine hastily . He 's going on and on about something or other , the cost of renting boats on the lake or would she like to play tennis . "
61584	61884	61580	61580	I	0	" says Jeannine , who does n't even own a racket . Would she like to come over that afternoon ? She leans away from the telephone to consult an imaginary appointment book , imaginary friends ; she allows reluctantly that oh yes , she might have some free time . It would really be fun to brush up on her tennis . Not that she 's really good , she adds hastily . X chuckles . Well , maybe . There are a few more commonplaces and she hangs up , bathed in perspiration and ready to weep . What 's the matter with me ? She should be happy , or at least smug , and here she is experiencing the keenest sorrow . What on earth for ? She digs her pencil vindictively into the telephone pad as if it were somehow responsible . Damn you . Perversely , images of silly Cal come back to her , not nice ones , either . She has to pick up the phone again , after verifying an imaginary date with an imaginary acquaintance , and tell X yes or no ; so Jeannine rearranges the scarf over her curlers , plays with a button on her blouse , stares miserably at her shoes , runs her hands over her knees , and makes up her mind . She 's nervous . Masochistic . It 's that old thing come back again about her not being good enough for good luck . That 's nonsense and she knows it . She picks up the phone , smiling : tennis , drinks , dinner , back in the city a few more dates where he can tell her about school and then one night ( hugging her a little extra hard)—“Jeannie
61892	62080	62081	62081	Cal	287	” My name is Jeannine . The shopping will be fun . I 'm twenty - nine , after all . It is with a sense of intense relief that she dials ; the new life is beginning . She can do it , too . She 's normal . She 's as good as every 129 other girl . She starts to sing under her breath . The phone bell rings in Telephoneland and somebody comes to pick it up ; she hears all the curious background noises of the relays , somebody speaking faintly very far away . She speaks quickly and distinctly , without the slightest hesitation now , remembering all those loveless nights with her knees poking up into the air , how she 's discommoded and almost suffocated , how her leg muscles ache and she ca n't get her feet on the surface of the bed . Marriage will cure all that . The scrub bing uncleanably old linoleum and dusting the same awful things , week after week . But he 's going places . She says boldly and decisively : “
62087	62103	62081	62081	Cal	287	" Shocked at her own treachery , she bursts into tears . She hears Cal say “
62108	62120	62121	62121	Cal	287	” and he tells her what bus he 'll be on . “
62123	62128	62121	62121	Cal	287	” she adds breathlessly ; "
62146	62249	62250	62250	Mother	1136	” She hangs up , much eased . It 'll be so much better once it 's done . Foolish Jeannine , to expect anything else . It 's an uncharted continent , marriage . She wipes her eyes with the back of her hand ; X can go to hell . Making conversation is just work . She strolls into the kitchenette where she finds herself alone ; Mrs. Dadier is outside in back , weeding a little patch of a garden all the Dadiers own in common ; Jeannine takes the screen out of the kitchen window and leans out . “
62252	62280	62281	62281	Mother	1136	" she says in a sudden flood of happiness and excitement , for the importance of what she has just done has suddenly become clear to her , "
62283	62291	62281	62281	Mother	1136	” ( waving wildly out the window ) “
62295	62320	62325	62325	darling	2942	” Mrs. Dadier , who is on her knees in the carrot bed , straightens up , shading her face with her one hand . “
62327	62336	62337	62337	Mother	1136	" Wher . I 'm getting a sort of “
62344	62413	62337	62337	Mother	1136	” What comes after this will be very exciting , a sort of dramatic presentation , for Jeannine will have a big wedding . Mrs. Dadier drops her gardening trowel in sheer astonishment . She 'll hurry inside , a tremendous elevation of mood enveloping both women ; they will , in fact , embrace and kiss one another , and Jeannine will dance around the 130 kitchen . “
62422	62506	62507	62507	Mother	1136	” Jeannine will exclaim . Both will cry . It 's the first time in Jeannine 's life that she 's managed to do something perfectly O.K. And not too late , either . She thinks that perhaps the lateness of her marriage will be compensated for by a special mellowness ; there must be , after all , some reason for all that experimenting , all that reluctance . She imagines the day she will be able to announce even better news : "
62517	62577	62514	62515	a baby	1311	” Cal himself hardly figures in this at all , for Jeannine has forgotten his laconism , his passivity , his strange mournfulness unconnected to any clear emotion , his abruptness , how hard it is to get him to talk about anything . She hugs herself , breathless with joy , waiting for Mrs. Dadier to hurry inside ; “
62582	63275	62514	62515	a baby	1311	” Mrs. Dadier will say emotionally , embracing Jeannine . It seems to Jeannine that she has never known anything so solid and beautiful as the kitchen in the morning sunlight , with the walls glowing and everything so delicately outlined in light , so fresh and real . Jeannine , who has almost been killed by an unremitting and drastic discipline not of her own choosing , who has been maimed almost to death by a vigilant self - suppression quite irrelevant to anything she once wanted or loved , here finds her reward . This proves it is all right . Everything is indubitably good and indubitably real . She loves herself , and if I stand like Atropos in the corner , with my arm around the shadow of her dead self , if the other Jeannine ( who is desperately tired and knows there is no freedom for her this side the grave ) attempts to touch her as she whirls joyfully past , Jeannine does not see or hear it . At one stroke she has amputated her past . She 's going to be fulfilled . She hugs herself and waits . That 's all you have to do if you are a real , first - class Sleeping Beauty . She knows . I m so happy . And there , but for the grace of God , go I. 131 PART SEVEN I 'll tell you how I turned into a man . First I had to turn into a woman . For a long time I had been neuter , not a woman at all but One Of The Boys , because if you walk into a gathering of men , professionally or otherwise , you might as well be wearing a sandwich board that says : LOOK ! I HAVE TITS ! there is this giggling and this chuckling and this reddening and this Uriah Heep twisting and writhing and this fiddling with ties and fixing of buttons and making of allusions and quoting of courtesies and this · self - conscious gallantry plus a smirky insistence on my physique — all this dreary junk just to please me . If you get good at being One Of The Boys it goes away . Of course there 's a certain disembodiment involved , but the sandwich board goes ; I back - slapped and laughed at blue jokes , especially the hostile kind . Underneath you keep saying pleasantly but firmly No no no no no no . But it 's necessary to my job and I like my job . I suppose they decided that my tits were not of the best kind , or not real , or that they were someone else 's ( my twin sister 's ) , so they split me from the neck up ; as I said , it demands a certain disembodiment . I thought that surely when I had acquired my Ph.D. and my professorship and my tennis medal and my engineer 's contract and my ten thousand a year and my full - time housekeeper and my reputation and the respect of my colleagues , when I had grown strong , tall , and beautiful , when my I.Q. shot 133 past 200 , when I had genius , then I could take off my sandwich board . I left my smiles and happy laughter at home . I 'm not a woman ; I 'm a man . I 'm a man with a woman 's face . I 'm a woman with a man 's mind . Everybody says so . In my pride of intellect I entered a bookstore ; I purchased a book ; I no longer had to placate The Man ; by God , I think I 'm going to make it . I purchased a copy of John Stuart Mill 's The Subjection of Women ; now who can object to John Stuart Mill ? He 's dead . But the clerk did . With familiar archness he waggled his finger at me and said “
63278	63513	62514	62515	a baby	1311	" ; all that writhing and fussing began again , what fun it was for him to have someone automatically not above reproach , and I knew beyond the shadow of a hope that to be female is to be mirror and honeypot , servant and judge , the terrible Rhadamanthus for whom he must perform but whose judgment is not human and whose services are at anyone 's command , the vagina dentata and the stuffed teddy - bear he gets if he passes the test . This is until you 're forty - five , ladies , after which you vanish into thin air like the smile of the Cheshire cat , leaving be hind only a disgusting grossness and a subtle poison that automatically infects every man under twenty - one . Nothing can put you above this or below this or beyond it or outside of it , nothing , nothing , nothing at all , not your muscles or your brains , not being one of the boys or being one of the girls or writing books or writing letters or screaming or wringing your hands or cooking lettuce or being too tall or being too short or traveling or staying at home or ugliness or acne or diffidence or cowardice or perpetual shrinking and old age . In the latter cases you 're only doubly damned . I went away—“forever
63516	64123	62514	62515	a baby	1311	” as the man says — and I cried as I drove my car , and I wept by the side of the road ( because I could n't see and I might crash into something ) and I howled and wrung my hands as peo ple do only in medieval romances , for an American woman 's closed car is the only place in which she can be alone ( if she 's unmarried ) and the howl of a sick she - wolf carries around the world , whereupon the world thinks it 's very comical . Privacy in cars and 134 bathrooms , what ideas we have ! If they tell me about the pretty clothes again , I 'll kill myself . I had a five - year - old self who said : Daddy wo n't love you . I had a ten - year - old self who said : the boys wo n't play with you . I had a fifteen - year - old self who said : nobody will marry you . I had a twenty - year - old self who said : you ca n't be fulfilled without a child . ( A year there where I had recurrent nightmares about abdominal cancer which nobody would take out . ) I 'm a sick woman , a madwoman , a ball - breaker , a man - eater ; I do n't consume men gracefully with my fire - like red hair or my poisoned kiss ; I crack their joints with these filthy ghoul 's claws and standing on one foot like a de - clawed cat , rake at your feeble efforts to save yourselves with my taloned hinder feet : my matted hair , my filthy skin , my big flat plaques of green bloody teeth . I do n't think my body would sell anything . I do n't think I would be good to look at . O of all diseases self - hate is the worst and I do n't mean for the one who suffers it ! Do you know , all this time you preached at me ? You told me that even Grendel 's mother was actuated by maternal love You told me ghouls were male . Rodan is male and asinine . King Kong is male . I could have been a witch , but the Devil is male . Faust is male . The man who dropped the bomb on Hiroshima was male . I was never on the moon . Then there are the birds , with ( as Shaw so nobly puts it ) the touching poetry of their loves and nestings in which the males sing so well and beautifully and the females sit on the nest , and the baboons who get torn in half ( female ) by the others ( male ) , and the chimpanzees with their hierarchy ( male ) written about by professors ( male ) with their hierarchy , who accept ( male ) the ( male ) view of ( female ) ( male ) . You can see what 's 135 happening . At heart I must be gentle , for I never even thought of the praying mantis or the female wasp ; but I guess I am just loyal to my own phylum . One might as well dream of being an oak tree . Chestnut tree , greatrooted hermaphrodite . I wo n't tell you what poets and prophets my mind is crammed full of ( Deborah , who said “
64131	64703	62514	62515	a baby	1311	" and got struck with leprosy ) , or Whom I prayed to ( exciting my own violent hilarity ) or whom I avoided on the street ( male ) or whom I watched on television ( male ) excepting in my hatred only — if I remember — Buster Crabbe , who is the former Flash Gordon and a swimming instructor ( I think ) in real life , and in whose humanly handsome , gentle , puzzled old face I had the absurd but moving fancy that I saw some reflection of my own bewilderment at our mutual prison . Of course I do n't know him and no one is responsible for his shadow on the screen or what madwomen may see there ; I lay in my bed ( which is not male ) , made in a factory by a ( male ) de signed by a ( male ) and sold to me by a ( small male ) with unusually bad manners . I mean unusually bad manners for anybody . You see how very different this is from the way things used to be in the bad old days , say five years ago . New Yorkers ( female ) have had the right to abortion for almost a year now , if you can satisfy the hospital boards that you deserve bed - room and do n't mind the nurses calling you Baby Killer ; citizens of Toronto , Canada , have perfectly free access to contraception if they are willing to travel 100 miles to cross the border , I could smoke my very own cigarette if I smoked ( and get my very own lung cancer ) . Forward , eternally forward ! Some of my best friends are I was about to say that some of my best friends are my friends My friends are dead . Whoever saw women scaring anybody ? ( This was while I thought it important to be able to scare people . ) You can not say , to paraphrase an old , good friend , that there are the plays of Shakespeare and Shakespeare was a woman , or that Columbus sailed the Atlantic and Columbus was a woman or that Alger Hiss was tried for treason and Alger Hiss was a woman . ( Mata Hari 136 was not a spy ; she was a fuckeress . ) Anyway everyboy ( sorry ) everybody knows that what women have done that is really important is not to constitute a great , cheap labor force that you can zip in when you 're at war and zip out again afterwards but to Be Mothers , to form the coming generation , to give birth to them , to nurse them , to mop floors for them , to love them , cook for them , clean for them , change their diapers , pick up after them , and mainly sacrifice themselves for them . This is the most important job in the world . That 's why they do n't pay you for it . I cried , and then stopped crying because otherwise I would never have stopped crying . Things come to an awful dead center that way . You will notice that even my diction is becoming feminine , thus revealing my true nature ; I am not saying "
64705	64710	62514	62515	a baby	1311	" any more , or "
64712	64722	62514	62515	a baby	1311	" ; I am putting in lots of qualifiers like "
64725	64781	62514	62515	a baby	1311	” I am writing in these breathless little feminine tags , she threw herself down on the bed , I have no structure ( she thought ) , my thoughts seep out shapelessly like menstrual fluid , it is all very female and deep and full of essences , it is very primitive and full of "
64785	64789	62514	62515	a baby	1311	” it is called “
64795	65605	62514	62515	a baby	1311	" Very swampy in my mind . Very rotten and badly off . I am a woman . I am a woman with a woman 's brain . I am a woman with a woman 's sickness . I am a woman with the wraps off , bald as an adder , God help me and you . Then I turned into a man . This was slower and less dramatic . I think it had something to do with the knowledge you suffer when you 're an outsider - I mean suffer ; I do not mean undergo or employ or tolerate or use or enjoy or catalogue or file away or entertain or possess or have . That knowledge is , of course , the perception of all 137 experience through two sets of eyes , two systems of value , two habits of expectation , almost two minds . This is supposed to be an infallible recipe for driving you gaga . Chasing the hare Reconciliation with the hounds of Persistence — but there , you see ? I 'm not Sir Thomas Nasshe ( or Lady Nasshe , either , tho ’ she never wrote a line , poor thing ) . Rightaway you start something , down comes the portcullis . Blap . To return to knowledge , I think it was seeing the lords of the earth at lunch in the company cafeteria that finally did me in ; as another friend of mine once said , men 's suits are designed to inspire confidence even if the men ca n't . But their shoes — Dear God . And their ears ! Jesus . The innocence , the fresh - faced naiveté of power . The childlike simplicity with which they trust their lives to the Black men who cook for them and their self - esteem and their vanity and their little dangles to me , who everything for them . Their ignorance , their utter , happy ignorance . There was the virgin We sacrificed on the company quad when the moon was full . ( You thought a virgin meant a girl , did n't you ? ) There was Our thinking about housework — dear God , scholarly papers about housework , what could be more absurd ! And Our parties where we pinched and chased Each Other . Our comparing the prices of women 's dresses and men 's suits . Our push - ups . Our crying in Each Other 's company . Our gossip . Our trivia . All trivia , not worth an instant 's notice by any rational being . If you see Us skulking through the bushes at the rising of the moon , do n't look . And do n't wait around . Watch the wall , my darling , you 'd better . Like all motion , I could n't feel it while it went on , but this is what you have to do : To resolve contrarieties , unite them in your own person . This means : in all hopelessness , in terror of your life , without a future , in the sink of the worst despair that you can endure and will yet leave you the sanity to make a choice take in your bare right hand one naked , severed end of a high - tension wire . Take the other in your left hand . Stand in a puddle . ( Do n't worry about letting go ; you ca n't . ) Electricity favors the prepared mind , and if you interfere in this avalanche 138 by accident you will be knocked down dead , you will be charred like a cutlet , and your eyes will be turned to burst red jellies , but if those wires are your own wires - hang on . God will keep your eyes in your head and your joints knit one to the other . When She sends the high voltage alone , well , we 've all experienced those little shocks — you just shed it over your outside like a duck and it does nothing to you — but when She roars down in high voltage and high amperage both , She is after your marrow - bones ; you are making yourself a conduit for holy terror and the ecstasy of Hell . But only in that way can the wires heal themselves . Only in that way can they heal you . Women are not used to power ; that avalanche of ghastly strain will lock your muscles and your teeth in the attitude of an electrocuted rabbit , but you are a strong woman , you are God 's favorite , and you can endure ; if you can say “
65611	66612	67168	67168	Friend	3453	on”-after all , where else can you go ? What else can you do?—if you let yourself through yourself and into yourself and out of yourself , turn yourself inside out , give yourself the kiss of reconciliation , marry yourself , love yourself Well , I turned into a man . We love , says Plato , that in which we are defective ; when we see our magical Self in the mirror of another , we pursue it with desperate cries Stop ! I must possess you!—but if it obligingly stops and turns , how on earth can one then possess it ? Fucking , if you will forgive the pun , is an anti - climax . And you are as poor as before . For years I wandered in the desert , crying : Why do you torment me so ? and Why do you hate me so ? and Why do you put me down so ? and I will abase myself and I will please you and Why , oh why have you forsaken me ? This is very feminine . What I learned late in life , under my rain of lava , under my kill - or - cure , unhappily , slowly , stubbornly , barely , and in really dreadful pain , was that there is one and only one way to possess that in which we are defective , therefore that which we need , therefore that which we want . Become it . ( Man , one assumes , is the proper study of Mankind . Years ago we were all cave Men . Then there is 139 Java Man and the future of Man and the values of Western Man and existential Man and economic Man and Freudian Man and the Man in the moon and modern Man and eighteenth - century Man and too many Mans to count or look at or believe . There is Mankind . An eerie twinge of laughter garlands these paradoxes . For years I have been saying Let me in , Love me , Approve me , Define me , Regulate me , Validate me , Support me . Now I say Move over . If we are all Mankind , it follows to my interested and righteous and rightnow very bright and beady little eyes , that I too am a Man and not at all a Woman , for honestly now , whoever heard of Java Woman and existential Woman and the values of Western Woman and scientific Woman and alienated nineteenth - century Woman and all the rest of that dingy and antiquated rag - bag ? All the rags in it are White , anyway . I think I am a Man ; I think you had better call me a Man ; I think you will write about me as a Man from now on and speak of me as a Man and employ me as a Man and recognize child - rearing as a Man 's business ; you will think of me as a Man and treat me as a Man until it enters your muddled , terrified , preposterous , nine - tenths - fake , loveless , papier - mâché - bull - moose head that I am a man . ( And you are a woman . ) That 's the whole secret . Stop hugging Moses ' tablets to your chest , nitwit ; you 'll cave in . Give me your Linus blanket , child . Listen to the female man .

Quod erat demonstrandum . It has been proved . 141 Janet has begun to follow strange men on the street ; whatever will become of her ? She does this either out of curiosity or just to annoy me ; whenever she sees someone who interests her , woman or man , she swerves automatically ( humming a little tune , da - dum , da - dee ) and continues walking but in the opposite direction . When Whileawayan 1 meets Whileawayan 2 , the first utters a compound Whileawayan word which may be translated as “

67422	67577	67361	67361	T'll	484	” says Laur , twisting my little finger . I bury my face in my hands . Ay , no . Ay , no . Laura must hear . She kissed my neck and then my ear in a passion for all the awful things I do as S & P ; I straightened up and rocked back and forth . The trouble with you people is you get no charge from death . Myself , it shakes me all over . Somebody I 'd never met had left a note saying the usual thing : ha ha on you , you do not exist , go away , for we are so bloody cooperative that we have this solipsistic underside , you see ? So I went up - moun- 143 tain and found her ; I turned on my two - way vocal three hundred yards from criminal Elena Twason and said , “

In my mind we changed places several times , she and I , both of us acting as illegally in our respective positions as we could , but I might be able to patch up some sort of story . As I watched her , she began to amble down the hillside , that little white patch of hair bobbing through the autumn foliage like a 144 deer 's tail . Chuckling to herself , idly swinging a stick she 'd picked up : weak little thing , just a twig really , too dry to hit anything without breaking . I ambled ghostly beside her ; it 's so pretty in the mountains at that time of year , everything burns and burns without heat . I think she was enjoying herself , having finally put herself , as it were , beyond the reach of consequences ; she took her little stroll until we were quite close to each other , close enough to converse face to face , perhaps as far as I am from you . She had made herself a crown of scarlet maple leaves and put it on her head , a little askew because it was a little too big to fit . She smiled at me . “
68215	68237	68240	68240	killer	2031	” she said . Then , drawing down the corners of her mouth with an ineffable air of gaiety and arrogance : “

She clasps her hands loosely in her lap , remembering perhaps what it had been like to carry the body of a sixty - year - old woman down a mountainside : at first something you wept over , then something horrible , then something only distaste ful , and finally you just did it . “

They are menarchal gifts , presented after all sorts of glass - blowing , clay - modeling , picture - painting , ring - dancing , and Heaven knows what sort of silliness done by the celebrants to honor the little girl whose cel- 148 ebration it is . There is a tremendous amount of kissing and hand - shaking . This is only the formal presentation , of course ; cheap , style - less models that you would n't want to give as presents are available to everybody long before this .

I came downstairs in my bathrobe at three A.M. , unable to sleep . This house ought to be ringed with government spies , keeping their eyes on our diplomat from the stars and her infernal , perverted friends , but nobody 's about . I met Jeannine in the kitchen in her pajamas , looking for the cocoa . Janet , still in sweater and slacks , was reading at the kitchen table , puffy - eyed from lack of sleep . She was cross - noting Gunnar Myrdal 's An American Dilemma and Marital Patterns of Nebraska College Sophomores , 1938–1948 . Jeannine said : “

70741	71251	70738	70738	Joanna	444	" After we had finished making love , he turned to the wall and said , ' Woman , you 're lovely . You 're sensuous . You should wear long hair and lots of eye make - up and tight clothing . ' Now what does this have to do with anything ? I remain bewildered . I have a devil of pride and a devil of despair ; I used to go out among the hills at seventeen ( this is a poetic euphemism for a suburban golf course ) and there , on my knees , I swear it , knelen on my kne , I wept aloud , I 150 wrung my hands , crying : I am a poet ! I am Shelley ! I am a genius ! What has any of this to do with me ! The utter irrelevancy . The inanity of the whole business . Lady , your slip 's showing . God bless . At eleven I passed an eighth - grader , a boy , who muttered between his teeth , Shake it but do n't break it . ' The career of the sexless sex object had begun . I had , at seventeen , an awful conversation with my mother and father in which they told me how fine it was to be a girl — the pretty clothes ( why are people so obsessed with this ? ) and how I did not have to climb Everest , but could listen to the radio and eat bon - bons while my Prince was out doing it . When I was five my indulgent Daddy told me he made the sun come up in the morning and I expressed my skepticism ; ' Well , watch for it tomorrow and you 'll see , ' he said . I learned to watch his face for cues as to what I should do or what I should say , or even what I should see . For fifteen years I fell in love with a different man every spring like a berserk cuckoo - clock . I love my body dearly and yet I would copulate with a rhinoceros if I could become not - awoman . There is the vanity training , the obedience training , the self - effacement training , the deference training , the dependency training , the passivity training , the rivalry training , the stupidity training , the placation training . How am I to put this together with my human life , my intellectual life , my solitude , my transcendence , my brains , and my fearful , fearful ambition ? I failed miserably and thought it was my own fault . You ca n't unite woman and human any more than you can unite matter and anti - matter ; they are designed not to be stable together and they make just as big an explosion inside the head of the unfortunate girl who believes in both . “

I 'll tell you a story about the old Whileawayan philoso pher — she is a folk character among us , rather funny in an odd way , or as we say , ' ticklish . ' The Old Whileawayan Philosopher was sitting cross - legged among her disciples ( as usual ) when , without the slightest explana- 153 tion , she put her fingers into her vagina , withdrew them , and asked , ' What have I here ? “

According to history 154 books you passed through the stage of feudal social organization in Europe some time ago . Frogs , on the other hand , are covered with mucus , which they find delightful ; they suffer agonies of passionate desire in which the males will embrace a stick or your finger if they can not get anything better , and they experience rapturous , metaphysical joy ( of a froggy sort , to be sure ) which shows plainly in their beautiful , chrysoberyllian eyes . “

But we were somewhere else . 155 PART EIGHT Who am I ? I know who I am , but what 's my brand name ? Me with a new face , a puffy mask . Laid over the old one in strips of plastic that hurt when they come oft , a blond Hallowe'en ghoul on top of the S.S. uniform . I was skinny as a beanpole underneath except for the hands , which were similarly treated , and that very impressive face . I did this once in my line of business , which I 'll go into a little later , and scared the idealistic children who lived downstairs . Their delicate skins red with offended horror . Their clear young voices raised in song ( at three in the morning ) . I do n't do this often ( say I , the ghoul ) but it 's great elevator technique , sticking your forefinger to the back of somebody 's neck while passing the fourth floor , knowing that he 'll never find out that you have n't a gun and that you 're not all there .

We wondered why we were in a white - walled penthouse living room overlooking the East River at night with furniture so sharp - edged and ultra - modern that you could cut yourself on it , with a wall - length bar , with a second wall hung entirely in black velvet like a stage , with a third wall all glass , outside which the city did not look quite as I remembered it . Now J ( as I shall call her ) is really terrifying , for she 's invisible . Against the black curtains her head and hands float in sinister disconnection , like puppets controlled by separate strings . There are baby spotlights in the ceiling , which illuminate in deep chiaroscuro her gray hair , her lined face , her rather macabre grin , for her teeth seem to be one fused ribbon of steel . She stepped out against the white wall , a woman - shaped hole , a black cardboard cut - out ; with a crooked , charming smile she clapped her hand to her mouth , either taking something out or putting something in - see ? Real teeth . Those disbodied , almost crippled hands clasped themselves . She sat on her black leather couch and vanished again ; she smiled and dropped fifteen years ; she has silver hair , not gray , and I do n't know how old she is . How she loves us ! She leans forward and croons at us like Garbo . Jeannine has sunk down into a collection of glass plates that passes for a chair ; her cup and spoon . make a tiny , spineless chattering .

( Her real laugh is the worst human sound I have ever heard : a hard , screeching yell that ends in gasps and rusty sobbing , as if some mechanical vulture on a gigantic garbage heap on the surface of the moon were giving one forced shriek for the death of all organic life . Yet J likes it . This is her private laugh . Alice is crippled , too ; the ends of her fingers ( she says ) were once caught in a press and are growing cancerous — and to be sure , if you look at them closely you can see folds of loose , dead skin over the ends of her fingernails . She has hairpin - shaped scars under her ears , too . Her pointed fingernails painted silver to distract the eye , Alice - Jael plays with the window console : the East River clouds over to reveal ( serially ) a desert morning , a black lava beach , and the surface of the moon . She sat , watching the pictures change , tapping her silver nails on the couch , herself the very picture of boredom . Come up close and you 'll see that her eyes are silver , most unnatural . It came to me that we had been watching this woman perform for half an hour and had given not one thought to what might be happening around us or to us or behind us . The East River ? “

74007	74398	74399	74399	You	2150	“ If we admit among the universes of probability any in which the laws of physical reality are different from our own , we will have an infinite number of universes . If we restrict ourselves to the laws of physical reality as we know them , we will have a limited number . Our universe is quantized ; therefore the differences between possible universes ( although very small ) must be similarly quantized , and the number of such universes must be finite ( although very large ) . I take it that it must be possible to distinguish the very smallest differences say , that of one quantum of light - for otherwise we could not find our way to the same universe time after time , nor could we return to our own . Current theory has it that one can not return to one 's own past , but only to other people 's ; similarly one can not travel into one 's own future , but only to other people 's , and in no way can these motions be forced to result in straightforward travel — from any baseline whatever . The only possible motion is diagonal motion . So you see that the classical paradoxes of time - travel simply do not apply — we can not kill our own grandmothers and thereby cease to exist , nor can we travel into our own future and affect it in advance , so to speak . Nor can I , once I have made contact with your present , travel into 160 erse in instruments et side of resides your located your past or your future . The best I can do in finding out my own future is to study one very close to my own , but here the cost of power becomes prohibitive . My Department 's researches are therefore conducted in regions rather far from home . Go too far and you find an Earth too close to the sun or too far away or nonexistent or barren of life ; come too close and it costs too much . We operate in a pretty small optimal range . And of course I was doing this on my own , which means I must steal the whole damn operation anyway . “
74512	74643	74510	74510	yourselves	2150	“ Genetic patterns sometimes repeat themselves from possible present universe to possible present universe ; this is also one of the elements that can vary between universes . There is repetition of genotypes in the far future too , sometimes . Here is Janet from the far future , but not my future or yours ; here are the two of you from almost the same moment of time ( but not as you see it ! ) , both of those moments only a little behind mine ; yet I wo n't happen in the world of either of you . We are less alike than identical twins , to be sure , but much more alike than strangers have any right to be . Look at yourselves again . “
75270	75340	75267	75268	a man	810	“ Janet , may I ask you why you and your neighbors do not show up on our instruments ? You must have discovered the theory of probability travel some time ago ( in your terms ) , yet you are the first traveler . You wish to visit other universes of probability , yet you make it impossible for anyone to find you , let alone visit you . “

75663	75668	75660	75660	I	0	“ Us and Them ? ”
75669	75675	75677	75678	Sweet Alice	501	" I 'll tell you , ”
75684	76121	75677	75678	Sweet Alice	501	“ After the plague - don't worry ; everything you eat is stuffed with anti - toxins and we 'll decontaminate you before you gobesides , this all ended more than seventy years ago - after the bacteriological weapons were cleaned out of the biosphere ( insofar as that was possible ) and half the population buried ( the dead half , I hope ) people became rather conservative . They tend to do that , you know . Then after a while you get the reaction against the conservatism , I mean the radicalism . And after that the reaction against the radicalism . People had already begun gathering in like - minded communities before the war : Traditionalists , Neo - Feudalists , Patriarchalists , Matriarchalists , Separatists ( all of us now ) , Fecundists , Sterilists , and what - have - you . They seemed to be happier that way . The War Between the Nations had really been a rather nice war , as wars go ; it wiped the have - not nations off the face of the earth and made their resources available to us without the bother of their populations ; all our machinery was left standing ; we were getting wealthier and wealthier . So if you were not one of the fifty percent who had died , you were having a pretty good time of it . There was increasing separatism , increasing irritability , increasing radicalism ; then came the Polarization ; then came the Split . The middle drops out and you 're left with the two ends , hein ? So when people began shopping for a new war , which they also seem to do , do n't they , there was only one war left . The only war that makes any sense if you except the relations between children and adults , which you must do because children grow up . But in the other war the Haves never stop being Haves and the Have - nots never stop being Have - nots . It 's cooled off now , unfortunately , but no wonder ; it 's been going on for forty years — a stalemate , if you 'll forgive the pun . But in my opinion , questions that are based on something real ought to be settled by 164 something real without all this damned lazy miserable drifting . I 'm a fanatic . I want to see this thing settled . I want to see it over and done with . Gone . Dead . “
76128	76132	75677	75678	Sweet Alice	501	” she added . “
76173	76219	76225	76225	Jeannine	406	" But it will get things moving . The long war will start up again . We will be in the middle of it and Iwho have always been in the middle of it — will get some decent support from my people at last . ”
76220	76223	76225	76225	Jeannine	406	“ Who ? "
76228	76256	76225	76225	Jeannine	406	“ Who , who , for Heaven 's sake ! Who 's Us , who 's Them ? Do you expect us to find out by telepathy ! ”
76257	76263	76265	76266	Alice Reasoner	500	“ I beg your pardon , ”
76269	76320	76265	76266	Alice Reasoner	500	“ I thought you knew . I had no intention of puzzling you . You are my guests . When I say Them and Us I mean of course the Haves and the Have - nots , the two sides , there are always two sides , are n't there ? “
76329	76343	76265	76266	Alice Reasoner	500	” Later I caught Jeannine by the door as we were all leaving ; "
76352	76393	76394	76394	She	2181	” I said . Something had gotten into Jeannine 's clear , suffering gaze ; something had muddied her timidity . What can render Miss Dadier self - possessed ? What can make her so quietly stubborn ? Jeannine said : “
76404	76559	76394	76394	She	2181	" VIL She took us topside in the branch elevator : The Young One , The Weak One , The Strong One , as she called us in her own mind . I 'm the author and I know . Miss Sweden ( she also called Janet this ) ran her hands over the paneling and studied the controls while the other two gaped . Think of me in my usual portable form . Their underground cities are mazes of corridors like sunken hotels ; we passed doors , barricades , store windows , branch corridors leading to arcades . What is 165 this passion for living underground ? At one barrier they put us in purdah , that is , some kind of asbestoslike fireman 's suit that protects you against other people 's germs and them against yours . But this time it was a fake , meant only to hide us . “
76568	76871	76563	76563	them	2184	” said Jael . She went apart with the border guard and there was some low - voiced , aggressive byplay , some snarling and lifting of hackles which a third party resolved by a kind of rough joking . I did n't hear a word of it . She told us honestly that we could n't be expected to believe anything we had n't seen with our own eyes . There would be no films , no demonstrations , no statistics , unless we asked for them . We trundled out of the elevator into an armored car waiting in a barn , and across an unpaved , shell - pocked plain , a sort of no - man's - land , in the middle of the night . Is the grass growing ? Is that a virus blight ? Are the mutated strains taking over ? Nothing but gravel , boulders , space , and stars . Jael flashed her pass at a second set of guards and told them about us , jerking her thumb backwards at the three of us : unclean , unclean , unclean . No barriers , no barbed wire , no searchlights ; only the women have these . Only the men make a sport of people - hunting across the desert . Bulkier than three pregnancies , we followed our creatrix into another car , from out that first one , through the rubble and ruin at the edges of an old city , left standing just as it had been during the plague . Teachers come out here on Sundays , with their classes . It looks as if it 's been used for target practice , with holes in everything and new scars , like mortar scars , on the rubble . “
76875	77263	76563	76563	them	2184	” says Jael Reasoner . Each of us wears a luminous , shocking - pink cross on chest and back to show how deadly we are . So the Manlanders ( who all carry guns ) wo n't take pot - shots at us . There are lights in the distance do n't think I know any of this by hearsay ; I 'm the spirit of the author and know all things . I 'll know it when we begin to pass the lit - up barracks at the edge of the city , when we see in the distance the homes of the very rich shining from the seven hilltops on which the city is built ; I 'll know it when we go through a tunnel of rubble , built fashionably to re- 166 semble a World War I trench , and emerge neither into a public nursery ( they 're either much further inside the city proper or out in the country ) nor into a brothel , but into a recreation center called The Trench or The Prick or The Crotch or The Knife . I have n't decided on a name yet . The Manlanders keep their children with them only when they 're very rich — but what posit I ? Manlanders have no children . Manlanders buy infants from the Womanlanders and bring them up in batches , save for the rich few who can order children made from their very own semen : keep them in city nurseries until they 're five , then out into the country training ground , with the gasping little misfits buried in baby cemeteries along the way . There , in ascetic and healthful settlements in the country , little boys are made into Men — though some do n't quite make it ; sex - change surgery begins at sixteen . One out of seven fails early and makes the full change ; one out of seven fails later and ( refusing surgery ) makes only half a change : artists , illusionists , impressionists of femininity who keep their genitalia but who grow slim , grow languid , grow emotional and feminine , all this the effect of spirit only . Five out of seven Manlanders make it ; these are “
77268	77272	77264	77266	real - men	2186	” The others are "
77275	77277	77278	77281	the half - changed	2187	" or "
77283	77372	77373	77373	Jael	500	” All real - men like the changed ; some real - men like the half - changed ; none of the realmen like real - men , for that would be abnormal . No body asks the changed or half - changed what they like . Jael flashed her civil pass at the uniformed real - man at the entrance to The Crotch and we trundled after . Our hands and feet look very small to me , our bodies odd and dumpy . We went inside ; “
77375	77379	77373	77373	Jael	500	” I exclaimed , "
77382	77383	77264	77266	real - men	2186	” “
77387	77471	77264	77266	real - men	2186	” she said . Look at the necks , look at the wrists and ankles , penetrate the veils of false hair and false eyelashes to measure the relative size of eyes and bone structure . The half - changed starve themselves to be slim , but look at their calves and the straightness of their arms and knees . If most of the fully changed live in harims and whore - homes , and if popular slang is beginning to call 167 them “
77474	77488	77264	77266	real - men	2186	” what does this leave for us ? What can we be called ? “
77492	77496	77264	77266	real - men	2186	” said Jael . “
77500	77613	77264	77266	real - men	2186	” We sat around a large table in the corner where the light was dim , snuggling up to the fake oak paneling . One of the guards , who had followed us inside , came up to Jael and put one giant arm round her , one huge paw crushing her bearishly to his side , his crimson epaulets , his gold boots , his shaved head , his sky - blue codpiece , his diamond - chequered - costumed attempt to beat up the whole world , to shove his prick up the world 's ass . She looked so plain next to him . She was all swallowed up . "

77661	77666	77669	77669	you	2188	” he said fetchingly . “
77683	77721	77669	77669	you	2188	” She smiled gracefully but remained modestly silent . This seemed to please him . He enveloped her further , to the point of vanishment , and said in a low voice with a sort of chuckle : "
77738	77739	77740	77740	You	2188	” “
77746	77750	77744	77744	Lenny	509	” she said . "

77858	77868	77846	77846	I	0	” he said ( pleading , I think ) . "
77876	77885	77886	77886	you	509	” cried Jael , moving behind the table , "
77908	77916	77899	77899	you	509	” He laughed , basso - profundo . “
77921	77929	77917	77917	We	2191	” he said , and winked laboriously . “
77932	77937	77917	77917	We	2191	” said Jael dryly . “
77948	78045	77940	77940	you	509	" and this tiresome creature began all over again , but 168 whether he noticed the rest of us or saw someone or smelt someone I do n't know , for suddenly he lumbered off in a great hurry , rousting his billy - club out of his azure sash , next the gun holster . Bouncers do n't use their guns at The Prick ; too much chance of hitting the wrong people . Jael was talking to someone else , a shadowy , thin - lipped party in a green , engineer 's suit . "
78052	78058	78050	78050	friends	2859	” said Jael Reasoner patiently . “
78296	78640	78641	78641	You	2203	” Astonishing how each of them has to be reassured of my loyalty ! says Jael Reasoner . Even more astonishing that they believe me . They 're not very bright , are they ? But these are the little fish . Besides , they 've been separated from real women so long that they do n't know what to make of us ; I doubt if even the sex surgeons know what a real woman looks like . The specifications we send them every year grow wilder and wilder and there is n't a murmur of protest . I think they like it . As moths to the flame , so men to the social patterns of the Army , that womanless world haunted by the ghosts of millions of dead women , that discarnate femininity that hovers over everybody and can turn the toughest real - man into one of Them , that dark force they always feel at the backs of their own minds ! Would I , do you think , force slavishness and deformity 169 on two - sevenths of my own kind ? Of course not ! I think these men are not human . No , no , that 's wrong , I decided long ago that they were n't human . Work is power , but they farm out everything to us without the slightest protest — Hell , they get lazier and lazier . They let us do their thinking for them . They even let us do their feeling for them . They are riddled with duality and the fear of duality . And the fear of themselves . I think it 's in their blood . What human being would sweating with fear and rage - mark out two equally revolting paths and insist that her fellowcreatures tread one or the other ? Ah , the rivalries of cosmic he - men and the worlds they must conquer and the terrors they must face and the rivals they must challenge and overcome ! “
78648	78657	78641	78641	You	2203	” says Janet pedantically from inside her suit , “
78668	79505	79506	79506	Her	2204	” Hsst ! Here comes my contact . Our contact was a half - changed , for Manlanders believe that child care is woman 's business ; so they delegate to the changed and the half - changed the business of haggling for babies and taking care of children during those all - important , first five years — they want to fix their babies ' sexual preferences early . This means , practically speaking , that the children are raised in brothels . Now some Manlander real - men do not like the idea of the whole business being in the hands of the feminized and the effeminate but there 's not much they can do about it ( see Proposition One , about child care , above)—although the more masculine look forward to a time when no Manlander will fall away from the ranks of the he - men , and with an obstinacy I consider perverse , refuse to decide who will be the sexual objects when the changed and the half - changed are no more . Perhaps they think sex beneath them . Or above them ? ( Around the shrine of each gowned and sequinned hostess in The Knife are at least three real - men ; how many can a hostess take on in one night ? ) I suspect we real women still figure , however grotesquely , in Manland 's deepest dreams ; perhaps on that morning of Total Masculinity they will all invade Womanland , rape everyone whole bminate bun one , a Took to from the epost stills take on at least owned and o abono 170 in sight ( if they still remember how ) and then kill them , and after that commit suicide upon a pyramid of their victims ' panties . The official ideology has it that women are poor substitutes for the changed . I certainly hope so . ( Little girls , crept out of their crèche at last , touching those heroic dead with curious , wee fingers . Nudging them with their patent leather Mary Janes . Bringing their baby brothers out to a party on the green , all flutes and oats and pastoral fun until the food gives out and the tiny heroines must decide : Whom shall we eat ? The waving limbs of our starfish siblings , our dead mothers , or those strange , huge , hairy bodies already beginning to swell in the sun ? ) I flashed that damned pass — again!—this time at a halfchanged in a pink chiffon gown , with gloves up to his shoulder , a monument of irrelevancy on high heels , a pretty girl with too much of the right curves and a bobbing , springing , pink feather boa . Where oh where is the shop that makes those long rhinestone earrings , objects of fetishism and nostalgia , worn only by the halfchanged ( and usually not by them unless they 're rich ) , hand - made from museum copies , of no use or interest to fully six - sevenths of the adult human race ? Somewhere stones are put together by antiquarians , somewhere petroleum is transformed into fabric that ca n't burn without polluting the air , and wo n't rot , and wo n't erode , so that strands of plastic have turned up in the bodies of diatoms at the bottom of the Pacific Trench - such a vision was he , so much he wore , such folds and frills and ribbons and buttons and feathers , trimmed like a Christmas tree . Like Garbo playing Anna Karenina , decorated all over . His green eyes shrewdly narrowed . This one has intelligence . Or is it only the weight of his false lashes ? The burden of having always to be taken , of having to swoon , to fall , to endure , to hope , to suffer , to wait , to only be ? There must be a secret feminine underground that teaches them how to behave ; in the face of their comrades ' derision and savage contempt , in the face of the prospect of gang rape if they 're found alone on the streets after curfew , in the face of the legal necessity to belong - every one of them — to a real - man , somehow they still ի կոկորդի he weight of aken , of having it , to only be 171 learn the classic shiver , the slow blink , the knuckle - tolip pathos . These , too , I think , must be in the blood . But whose ? My three friends and I pale beside such magnificence ! Four lumpy parcels , of no interest to anyone at all , at all . Anna , with a mechanical shiver of desire , says that we must go with him . "
79508	79514	79515	79515	Him	2204	” says Jeannine , confused . "
79517	79712	79515	79515	Him	2204	” says Anna in a strained contralto . The half - changed are very punctilious — sometimes about the changeds ' superiority and sometimes about their own genitals . Either way it works out to Him . He 's extraordinarily aware , for a man , of Jeannine 's shrinking and he resents it — as who would not ? I myself am respectful of ruined lives and forced choices . On the street once Anna did not fight hard enough against the fourteen - year - old toughs who wanted his twelve - year - old ass ; he did n't go to the extremity of berserk rage , reckoning his life as nothing in defense of his virility ; he forestalled — by surrender — the plucking out of an eye , the castration , the throat cut with a broken bottle , the being put out of his twelve - year - old action with a stone or a tire chain . I know a lot about Manlanders ' history . Anna made a modus vivendi , he decided life was worth it on any terms . Everything follows from that . “
79719	80191	79715	79715	you	2205	” says Jeannine , heartfelt . Sisters in misfortune . This really pleases Anna . He shows us a letter of safe - conduct he has from his boss — a realman , of course — and putting it back in his pink - brocaded evening bag , draws around him that fake - feather Thing which floats and wobbles in the least current of air . It 's a warm evening . To protect his employé , the big boss ( they are Men , even in the child - rearing business ) has had to give Anna K a little two - way TV camera to wear in his ear ; otherwise somebody would break his high heels and leave him dead or half - dead in an alley . Everybody knows that the half - changed are weak and ca n't protect themselves ; what do you think femininity is all about ? Even so Anna probably has a bodyguard waiting at the entrance to The Knife . I 'm cynical enough to wonder sometimes if the Manlanders mystique is n't just an excuse to feminize anybody with 172 a pretty face — but look again , they believe it ; look under the padding , the paint , the false hair , the corsetry , the skin rinses and the magnificent dresses and you 'll see nothing exceptional , only faces and bodies like any other man 's . Anna bats his eyes at us and wets his lips , taking the women inside the suits to be real - men , taking me to be a real - man ( what else can I be if I 'm not a changed ? ) , taking the big wide world itself to be — what else?-a Real - Man intent on worshipping Anna 's ass ; the world exists to look at Anna ; he or she is only a real - man turned inside out . An eerie sisterliness , a smile at Jeannine . Al that narcissism ! Brains underneath , though . Remember where their loyalties lie . ( Are they jealous of us ? I do n't think they believe we 're women . ) He wets his lips again , the indescribable silliness of that insane mechanism , practiced anywhere and everywhere , on the right people , on the wrong people . But what else is there ? It seems that Anna 's boss wants to meet me . ( I do n't like that . ) But we 'll go ; we maintain our outward obedience until the very end , until the beautiful , bloody moment that we fire these stranglers , these murderers , these unnatural and atavistic nature 's bastards , off the face of the earth . “
80195	80202	80192	80193	Dearest sister	2206	” says Anna softly , sweetly , "

An over - familiar mode ! Dawn comes up over the waste land , bringing into existence the boulders and pebbles battered long ago by bombs , dawn gilding with its pale possibilities even the Crazy Womb , the Ball - breaking Bitch , the Fanged Killer Lady .

85342	86287	85338	85338	I	0	" It takes four hours to cross the Atlantic , three to shuttle to a different latitude . Waking up in a Vermont autumn morning , inside the glass cab , while all around us the maples and sugar maples wheel slowly out of the fog . Only this part of the world can produce such color . We whispered at a walking pace through wet fires . Electric vehicles are quiet , too ; we heard the drip of water from the leaves . When the house saw us , my old round lollipop - on - a - stick , it lit up from floor to top , and as we came nearer broadcast the Second Brandenburg through the black , wet tree - trunks and the fiery 184 leaves , a delicate attention I allow myself and my guests from time to time . Shouting brilliantly through the wet woods I prefer the unearthy purity of the electronic scoring . One approaches the house from the side , where it looks almost flat on its central columnonly a little convex , really — it does n't squat down for you on chicken legs like Baba Yaga 's hut , but lets down from above a great , coiling , metal - mesh road like a tongue ( or so it seems ; in reality it 's only a winding staircase ) . Inside you find yourself a corridor away from the main room ; no use wasting heat . Davy was there . The most beautiful man in the world . Our approach had given him time to make drinks for us — which the J 's took from his tray , staring at him but he was n't embarrassed - curled up most unwaiterlike at my feet with his hands around his knees and proceeded to laugh at the right places in the conversation ( he takes his cues from my face ) . The main room is panelled in yellow wood with a carpet you can sleep on ( brown ) and a long , glassed - in porch from which we watch the blizzards sweep by five months out of the year . I like purely visual weather . It 's warm enough for Davy to go around naked most of the time , my ice lad in a cloud of gold hair and nudity , never so much a part of my home as when he sits on the rug with his back against a russet or vermilion chair ( we mimic autumn here ) , his drowned blue eyes fixed on the winter sunset outside , his hair turned to ash , the muscles of his back and thighs stirring a little . The house hangs oddments from the ceiling ; found objects , mobiles , can openers , red balls , bunches of wild grass , and Davy plays with them . I showed the J 's around : the books , the microfilm viewer in the library in touch with our regional library miles away , the storage spaces in the walls , the various staircases , the bathrooms molded of glass fiber and put together from two pieces , the mattresses stored in the walls of the guest rooms , and the conservatory ( near the central core , to make use of the heat ) where Davy comes and mimics wonder , watching the lights shine on my orchids , my palmettos , my bougainvillea , my whole little mess of tropical plants . I even have a glassed - in 185 space for cacti . There are outside plantings where in season you can find mountain laurel , a tangled maze of rhododendron , scattered irises that look like an expensive and antique cross between insects and lingerie but these are under snow now . I even have an electrified fence , inherited from my predecessor , that encloses the whole estate to keep out the deer and occasionally kills trees which take the mild climate around the house a little too much for granted . I let the J 's peep into the kitchen , which is an armchair with controls like a 707 's , but not the place where I store my tools and from which I have access to the central core when House has indigestion . That 's dirty and you need to know what you 're doing . I showed them Screen , which keeps me in touch with my neighbors , the nearest of whom is ten miles away , Telephone , who is my long - distance backup line , and Phonograph , where I store my music . Jeannine said she did n't like her drink ; it was n't sweet enough . So I had Davy dial her another . Do you want dinner ? ( She blushed . ) My palace and gardens ( said I ) I acquired late in life when I became rich and influential ; before that I lived in one of the underground cities among the damnedest passel of neighbors you ever saw , sentimental Arcadian communes — underground , mind you!- whose voices would travel up the sewer pipes at all the wrong times of day and night , shrill sacrifices to love and joy when you want to sleep , ostentatious shuddering whenever I appeared in the corridor , wincing and dashing back inside to huddle together like kittens , conscious of their own innocence , and raise their pure young voices in the blessedness of community song . You know the kind : “
86294	86480	85338	85338	I	0	” in a soft , wondering , highly reproachful voice while she closes the door gently but firmly on your thumb . They thought I was Ultimate Evil . They let me know it . They are the kind who want to win the men over by Love . There 's a game called Pussycat that 's great fun for the player ; it goes like this : Meeow , I 'm dead ( lying on your back , all four paws engagingly held in the air , playing helpless ) ; there 's another called Saint George octogetherilor , win shuddere 186 and the Dragon with You Know Who playing You Know What ; and when you can no longer tolerate either , you do as I did : come home in a hobgoblin - head of a disguise , howling and chasing your neighbors down the hall while they scream in genuine terror ( well , sort of ) . Then I moved . That was my first job , impersonating one of the Manlanders ' police ( for ten minutes ) . By "
86482	86504	87516	87517	his wife	1279	" I do n't mean what I was sent to do last night , that was open and legitimate , but a "
86506	87513	87514	87514	I	0	" is a little bit under the table . It took me years to throw off the last of my Pussy - fetters , to stop being ( however brutalized ) vestigially Pussy - cat - ified , but at last I did and now I am the rosy , wholesome , single - minded assassin you see before you today . I come and go as I please . I do only what I want . I have wrestled myself through to an independence of mind that has ended by bringing all of you here today . In short , I am a grown woman . I was an old - fashioned girl , born forty - two years ago in the last years before the war , in one of the few mixed towns still left . It amazes me sometimes to think of what my life would have been like without the war , but I ended up in a refugee camp with my mother . Maddened Lesbians did not put cigarette butts out on her breasts , propaganda to the contrary ; in fact she got a lot more self - confident and whacked me when I tore to pieces ( out of pure curiosity ) a paper doily that decorated the top of the communal radio - this departure from previous practice secretly gratified me and I decided I rather liked the place . We were re - settled and I was sent to school once the war cooled off ; by ' 52 our territories had shrunk to pretty much what they are today , and we 've grown too wise since to think we can gain anything by merely annexing land . I was trained for years — we deplore what we must nonetheless use ! — and began my slow drift away from the community , that specialization ( they say ) that brings you closer to the apes , though I do n't see how such an exceedingly skilled and artificial practice can be anything but quintessentially human . 187 At twelve I artlessly told one of my teachers that I was very glad I was being brought up to be a manwoman , and that I looked down on those girls who were only brought up to be woman - women . I 'll never forget her face . She did not thrash me but let an older girl - girl do it - I told you I was old - fashioned . Gradually this sort of thing wears off ; not everything with claws and teeth is a Pussycat . On the contrary ! My first job ( as I told you ) was impersonating one of the Manlander police ; my most recent one was taking the place of a Manlander diplomat for eighteen months in a primitive patriarchy on an alternate Earth . Oh yes , the Men also have probability - travel , or rather they have it through us ; we run the routine operations for them . So far has corruption progressed ! With my silver hair , my silver eyes , and my skin artificially darkened to make me look even stranger to the savages , I was presented as a Prince of Faery , and in that character I lived in a dank stone castle with ghastly sanitary arrangements and worse beds for a year and a half . A place that would make your hair stand on end . Jeannine must stop looking so skeptical - please reflect that some societies stylize their adult roles to such a degree that a giraffe could pass for a man , especially with seventyseven layers of clothes on , and a barbarian prudery that keeps you from ever taking them off . They were impossible people . I used to make up stories about the Faery women ; once I killed a man because he said something obscene about the Faery women . Think of that ! You must imagine me as the quiet , serene Christian among the pagans , the courteous magician among the blunt men - o'-war , the overcivilized stranger ( possibly a Demon because he was understood to have no beard ) who spoke softly and never accepted challenges , but who was not afraid of anything under Heaven and who had a grip of steel . And so on . Oh , those cold baths ! And the endless joking about how they were n't queer , by God ! And the bellicosity , the continual joshing that catches in your skin like thorns and exasperates you almost to murder , and the constant fingering of sex and womankind with its tragic , pitiable bafflement and its even worse bragging ; and last of all the 188 perpetual losing battle with fear , the constant unloading of anxious weaknesses on to others ( and their consequent enraged fury ) as if fear and weakness were not the best guides we human beings ever had ! Oh , it was rich ! When they found that not a knight in the Men 's House could lay a hand on me , they begged for instruction ; I had half the warriors of the mead - hall doing elementary ballet under the mistaken impression that they were learning ju - jitsu . They may be doing it still . It made them sweat enough and it 's my signature , plain as day , to the whole bloody universe and any Manlander who turns up there again . A barbarian woman fell in love with me . It 's terrible to see that slavishness in someone else 's eyes , feel that halo she puts around you , and know from your own person the nature of that eager deference men so often perceive as admiration . Validate me ! she cried . Justify me ! Raise me up ! Save me from the others ! ( “
87519	87534	87535	87535	I	0	” she says , turning the mystic ring round and round on her finger , “
87540	88325	87535	87535	I	0	" ) So somewhere I have a kind of widow . I used to talk to her sensibly , as no man ever had before , I think . I tried to take her back with me , but could n't get authorization for her . Somewhere out there is a murderess as rosy and single - minded as I , if we could only get to her . May She save us all ! I saved the King 's life once by pinning to the festive Kingly board a pretty little hamadryad somebody had imported from the Southern lands to kill His Majesty . This helped me a good deal . Those primitive warriors are brave men — that is , they are slaves to the fear of fear — but there are some things they believe every man is entitled to run from in abject terror , viz . snakes , ghosts , earthquakes , disease , demons , magic , childbirth , menstruation , witches , afreets , incubi , succubi , solar eclipses , reading , writing , good manners , syllogistic reasoning , and what we might generally call the less reliable phenomena of life . The fact that I was not afraid to pin a poisonous snake to a wooden table with a fork ( a piece of Faery handicraft I had brought with me to eat meat with ) raised my prestige immensely . Oh yes , if it had bitten me , I would have been dead . But they do n't 189 move that fast . Think of me in quilting and crino lines — not like a Victorian lady , like a player in Kabuki - holding up that poor little broken - backed dinkus amid general hurrahs . Think of me astride a coal - black charger , my black - and - silver cloak streaming in the wind under a heraldic banner comprising crossed forks on a field of reptile eggs . Think of anything you please . Think , if you will , how hard it is to remain calm under constant insults , and of the genuine charm of playing bullfight with a big , beautiful , nasty blond who goes hartyhar every chance he gets , and whom you can reel in and spin out again as if you knew all his control buttons , as indeed you do . Think of giving the King bad advice week after week : modestly , deliberately , and successfully . Think of placing your ladylike foot on the large , dead neck of a human dinosaur who has bothered you for months and has finally tried to kill you ; there he lies , this big , carnal flower gathered at last by Chaos and Old Night , torn and broken in the dust , a big limpid Nada , a nothing , a thing , an animal , a creature brought down at last out of his pride to the truth of his organic being- and you did it . I keep one precious souvenir of that time : the look on the face of my most loyal feudal retainer when I revealed my sex to him . This was a man I had all - butseduced without his knowing it - little touches on the arm , the shoulder , the knee , a quiet manner , a certain look in the eyes — nothing so gross that he thought it to be in me ; he assumed it was all in himself . I loved that part . His first impulse , of course , was to hate me , fight me , drive me off — but I was n't doing anything , was I ? I had made no advances to him , had I ? What sort of mind did he have ? A pitiable confusion ! So I got even nicer . He got madder and guiltier , of course , and loathed the very sight of me because I made him doubt his own reason ; finally he challenged me and I turned him into a faithful dog by beating him right into the ground ; I kicked that man so bloody hard that I could n't stand it myself and had to explain to him that what he believed were unnatural lusts were really a species of religious reverence ; he just wanted to lie peacefully on the ground and kiss my boot . qook in the eyessumed it was arse , was to 190 The day that I left I went out into the hills with a few friends for the Faery “
88327	89451	87535	87535	I	0	” that was to take me away , and when the Bureau people radio'd me they were ready , I sent the others away , and I told him the truth . I divested myself of my knightly attire ( no mean trick , considering what those idiots wear ) and showed him the marks of Eve ; for a moment I could see that stinking bastard 's whole world crumble . For a moment he knew . Then , by God , his eyes got even more moist and slavish , he sank to his knees and piously elevating his gaze , exclaimed in a rapture of feudal enthusiasm - Humanity mending its fencesIf the women of Faery are like this , just think what the MEN must be ! One of Her little jokes . Oh Lord , one of Her hardest jokes . If you want to be an assassin , remember that you must decline all challenges . Showing off is not your job . If you are insulted , smile meekly . Do n't break your cover . Be afraid . This is information about the world . You are valuable . Push yourself . Take the easiest way out whenever possible . Resist curiosity , pride , and the temptation to defy limits . You are not your own woman and must be built to last . Indulge hatred . Action comes from the heart . Pray often . How else can you quarrel with God ? Does this strike you as painfully austere ? If not , you are like me ; you can turn yourself inside out , you can live for days upside down , the most biddable , unblushing servant of the Lady since the Huns sacked Rome , just for fun . Anything pursued to its logical end is revelation ; as Blake says , The path of Excess leads to the Palace of Wisdom , to that place where all things converge but up high , up unbearably high , that mental success which leads you into yourself , under the aspect of eternity , where you are limber and nice , where you act eternally under the aspect of Everything and where by doing the One Genuine Thing — you can not do anything untruly or half - way . To put it simply : those are the times that I am most myself . ction comust be built lolimits . You 191 Sometimes I am a little remorseful ; I grow sorry that the exercise of my art entails such unpleasant consequences for other people , but really ! Hate is a material like any other . If you want me to do something else useful , you had better show me what that something else is . Sometimes I go into one of our cities and have little sprees in the local museums ; I look at pictures , I get a hotel room and take long hot baths , I drink lots of lemonade . But the record of my life is the record of work , slow , steady , responsible work . I tied my first sparring partner in enraged knots , as Brynhild tied up her husband in her girdle and hung him on the wall , but aside from that I have never hurt a fellow Womanlander ; when I wanted to practice deadly strategies , I did it on the school robot . Nor do I have love - affairs with other women ; in some things , as I told you , I am a very old - fashioned girl . The art , you see , is really in the head , however you train the body . What does all this mean ? That I am your hostess , your friend , your ally . That we are in the same boat . That I am the grand - daughter of Madam Cause ; my great - aunts are Mistress Doasyouwouldbedoneby and her slower sister , Mistress Bedonebyasyoudid . As for my mother , she was an ordinary woman — that is to say , very helpless — and as my father was pure appearance ( and hence nothing at all ) , we need n't trouble about him . Everything I do , I do by Cause , that is to say Because , that is to say out of necessity , will - I , nill - I , ineluctably , because of the geas laid on me by my grandmother Causality . And now — since hysterical strength affects me the way staying up all night affects you — I'm going to sleep . In my sleep I had a dream and this dream was a dream of guilt . It was not human guilt but the kind of helpless , hopeless despair that would be felt by a small 192 wooden box or geometrical cube if such objects had consciousness ; it was the guilt of sheer existence . It was the secret guilt of disease , of failure , of ugliness ( much worse things than murder ) ; it was an attribute of my being like the greenness of the grass . It was in me . It was on me . If it had been the result of anything I had done , I would have been less guilty . In my dream I was eleven years old . Now in my eleven years of conventional life I had learned many things and one of them was what it means to be convicted of rape — I do not mean the man who did it , I mean the woman to whom it was done . Rape is one of the Christian mysteries , it creates a luminous and beautiful tableau in people 's minds ; and as I listened furtively to what nobody would allow me to hear straight out , I slowly came to understand that I was face to face with one of those shadowy feminine disasters , like pregnancy , like disease , like weakness ; she was not only the victim of the act but in some strange way its perpetrator ; somehow she had attracted the lightning that struck her out of a clear sky . A diabolical chance — which was not chance — had revealed her to all of us as she truly was , in her secret inadequacy , in that wretched guiltiness which she had kept hidden for seventeen years but which now finally manifested itself in front of everybody . Her secret guilt was this : She was Cunt . She had “
89453	89489	87535	87535	I	0	” something . Now the other party to the incident had manifested his essential nature , too ; he was Prick - but being Prick is not a bad thing . In fact , he had “
89493	89500	87535	87535	I	0	” something ( possibly what she had “
89502	89840	91603	91603	Davy	201	” ) . . And there I was , listening at eleven years of age : She was out late at night . She was in the wrong part of town . Her skirt was too short and that provoked him . She liked having her eye blacked and her head banged against the sidewalk . I understood this perfectly . ( I reflected thus in my dream , in my state of being a pair of eyes in a small wooden box stuck forever on a gray , geometric 193 plane — or so I thought . ) I too had been guilty of what had been done to me , when I came home from the playground in tears because I had been beaten up by bigger children who were bullies . I was dirty . I was crying . I demanded comfort . I was being inconvenient . I did not disappear into thin air . And if that is n't guilt , what is ? I was very lucid in my nightmare . I knew it was not wrong to be a girl because Mommy said so ; cunts were all right if they were neutralized , one by one , by being hooked on to a man , but this orthodox arrangement only partly redeems them and every biological possessor of one knows in her bones that radical inferiority which is only another name for Original Sin . Pregnancy , for example ( says the box ) , take pregnancy now , it 's a disaster , but we 're too enlightened to blame the woman for her perfectly natural behavior , are n't we ? Only keep it secret and keep it going — and I 'll give you three guesses as to which partner the pregnancy is in . When you grow up as an old - fashioned girl , you always remember that cozy comfort : Daddy getting angry a lot but Mummy just sighs . When Daddy says , “
89857	89954	89849	89849	women	2581	” he is n't asking a real ques . tion any more than he 'd ask a real question of a lamp or a wastebasket . I blinked my silver eyes inside my box . If you stumble over a lamp and you curse that lamp and then you become aware that inside that lamp ( or that wooden box or that pretty girl or that piece of bric - a - brac ) is a pair of eyes watching you and that pair of eyes is not amused — what then ? Mommy never shouted , "
89961	91557	89955	89955	I	0	” She controlled herself to avoid a scene . That was her job . I 've been doing it for her ever since . Now here the idiot reader is likely to hit upon a fascinating speculation ( maybe a little late ) , that my guilt is blood - guilt for having killed so many men . I everhen Daletting your 194 suppose there is nothing to be done about this . Anybody who believes I feel guilty for the murders I did is a Damned Fool in the full Biblical sense of those two words ; you might as well kill yourself right now and save me the trouble , especially if you 're male . I am not guilty because I murdered . I murdered because I was guilty . Murder is my one way out . For every drop of blood shed there is restitution made ; with every truthful reflection in the eyes of a dying man I get back a little of my soul ; with every gasp of horrified comprehension I come a little more into the light . See ? It 's me ! I am the force that is ripping out your guts ; I , I , I , the hatred twisting your arm ; I , I , I , the fury who has just put a bullet into your side . It is I who cause this pain , not you . It is I who am doing it to you , not you . It is I who will be alive tomorrow , not you . Do you know ? Can you guess ? Are you catching on ? It is I , who you will not admit exists . Look ! Do you see me ? I , I , I. Repeat it like magic . That is not me . I am not that . Luther crying out in the choir like one possessed : NON SUM , NON SUM , NON SUM ! This is the underside of my world . Of course you do n't want me to be stupid , bless you ! you only want to make sure you 're intelligent . You do n't want me to commit suicide ; you only want me to be gratefully aware of my dependency . You do n't want me to despise myself ; you only want to ensure the flattering deference to you that you consider a spontaneous tribute to your natural qualities . You do n't want me to lose my soul ; you only want what everybody wants , things to go your way ; you want a devoted helpmeet , a self - sacrificing mother , a hot chick , a darling daughter , women to look at , women to laugh at , women to come to for comfort , women to wash your floors and buy your groceries and cook your food and keep your children out of your hair , to work when you need the money and stay home when you do n't , women to be enemies when you want a good fight , women who are sexy when you want a good lay , women who do n't 195 complain , women who do n't nag or push , women who do n't hate you really , women who know their job , and above all — women who lose . On top of it all , you sincerely require me to be happy ; you are naively puzzled that I should be so wretched and so full of venom in this best of all possible worlds . Whatever can be the matter with me ? But the mode is more than a little outworn . As my mother once said : The boys throw stones at the frogs in jest . But the frogs die in earnest . I do n't like didactic nightmares . They make me sweat . It takes me fifteen minutes to stop being a wooden box with a soul and to come back to myself in ordinary human bondage . Davy sleeps nearby . You 've heard about blueeyed blonds , have n't you ? I passed into his room barefoot and watched him curled in sleep , unconscious , the golden veils of his eyelashes shadowing his cheeks , one arm thrown out into the streak of light falling on him from the hall . It takes a lot to wake him ( you can almost mount Davy in his sleep ) but I was too shaken to start right away and only squatted down by the mattress he sleeps on , tracing with my fingertips the patterns the hair made on his chest : broad high up , over the muscles , then narrowing toward his delicate belly ( which rose and fell with his breathing ) , the line of hair to below the navel , and then that suddenly stiff blossoming of the pubic hair in which his relaxed genitals nestled gently , like a rosebud . I told you I was an old - fashioned girl . I caressed his dry , velvety - skinned organ until it stirred in my hand , then ran my fingernails lightly down his sides to wake him up ; I did the same though very lightly — to the insides of his arms . He opened his eyes and smiled starrily at me . 196 It 's very pleasant to follow Davy 's hairline around his neck with your tongue or nuzzle all the hollows of his long - muscled , swimmer 's body : inside the elbows , the forearms , the place where the back tapers inward under the ribs , the backs of the knees . A naked man is a cross , the juncture elaborated in vulnerable and delicate flesh like the blossom on a banana tree , that place that 's given me so much pleasure . I nudged him gently and he shivered a little , bringing his legs together and spreading his arms flat ; with my forefinger I made a transient white line on his neck . Little Davy was half - filled by now , which is a sign that Davy wants to be knelt over . I obliged , sitting across his thighs , and bending over him without touching his body , kissed him again and again on the mouth , the neck , the face , the shoulders . He is very , very exciting . He 's very beautiful , my classic mesomorphic monster - pet . Putting one arm under his shoulders to lift him up , I rubbed my nipples over his mouth , first one and then the other , which is nice for us both , and as he held on to my upper arms and let his head fall back , I pulled him to me , kneading his back muscles , kneading his buttocks , sliding down to the mattress with him . Little Davy is entirely filled out now . So lovely : Davy with his head thrown to one side , eyes closed , his strong fingers clenching and unclenching . He began to arch his back , as his sleepiness made him a little too quick for me , so I pressed Small Davy between thumb and forefinger just enough to slow him down and then — when I felt like it - playfully started to mount him , rubbing the tip of him , nipping him a little on the neck . His breathing in my ear , fingers convulsively closing on mine . I played with him a little more , tantalizing him , then swallowed him whole like a watermelon seed—50 fine inside ! with Davy moaning , his tongue inside my mouth , his blue gaze shattered , his whole body uncontrollably arched , all his sensation concentrated in the place where I held him . I do n't do this often , but that time I made him come by slipping a finger up his anus : convulsions , fires , crying in no words as the sensation was pulled out of 197 him . If I had let him take more time , I would have climaxed with him , but he 's stiff for quite a while after he comes and I prefer that ; I like the after - tremors and the after - hardness , slipperier and more pliable than before ; Davy has an eerie malleability at those times . I grasped him internally , I pressed down on him , enjoying in the one act his muscular throat , the hair under his arms , his knees , the strength of his back and buttocks , his beautiful face , the fine skin on the inside of his thighs . Kneaded and bruised him , hiccoughing inside with all my architecture : little buried rod , swollen lips and grabby sphincter , the flexing half - moon under the pubic bone . And everything else in the vicinity , no doubt . I 'd had him . Davy was mine . Sprawled blissfully over him — I was discharged down to my fingertips but still quietly throbbing — it had really been a good one . His body so warm and wet under me and inside me . XII And looked up to see -the three J 's “
91565	91600	91603	91603	Davy	201	” said Janet to Joanna . 198 Something pierces the sweetest solitude . I got up , tickled him with the edge of my claw , joined them at the door . Closing it . “
91605	91616	91603	91603	Davy	201	” This is one of the key words that the house "
91618	91652	91913	91913	you	2337	” ; the central computer will transmit a pattern of signals to the implants in his brain and he will stretch out obediently on his mattress ; when I say to the main computer “
91655	91892	91603	91603	Davy	201	” Davy will sleep . You have already seen what else happens . He 's a lovely limb of the house . The original germ - plasm was chimpanzee , I think , but none of the behavior is organically controlled any more . True , he does have his minimal actions which he pursues without mehe eats , eliminates , sleeps , and climbs in and out of his exercise box — but even these are caused by a standing computer pattern . And I take precedence , of course . It is theoretically possible that Davy has ( tucked away in some nook of his cerebrum ) consciousness of a kind that may never even touch his active life — is Davy a poet in his own peculiar way?—but I prefer to believe not . His consciousness — such as it is and I am willing to grant it for the sake of argument – is nothing but the permanent possibility of sensation , a mere intellectual abstraction , a nothing , a picturesque collocation of words . It is experientially quite empty , and above all , it is nothing that need concern you and me . Davy 's soul lies somewhere else ; it 's an outside soul . Davy 's soul is in Davy 's beauty ; and Beauty is always empty , always on the outside . Is n't it ? "
91895	91905	91603	91603	Davy	201	" I said ( to the J 's ) . “

91925	91995	91913	91913	you	2337	” I said . Jeannine does n't understand what we 're talking about ; Joanna does and is appalled ; Janet is thinking . I shooed them into the main room and told them who he was . 199 Alas ! those who were shocked at my making love that way to a man are now shocked at my making love to a machine ; you ca n't win . “

She was radiant with health and life , a study in dirty blue jeans . I knelt down by her chair and kissed her on the back of her smooth , honeyed , hot neck with a despairing feeling that now I had done it — but asking is n't getting . Wanting is n't having . She 'll refuse and the world will be itself again . I waited confidently for the rebuke , for the eternal order to reassert itself ( as it had to , of course)—for it would in fact take a great deal of responsibility off my hands . But she let me do it . She blushed and pretended not to notice . I ca n't describe to you how reality itself tore wide open at that moment . She kept on reading and I trod at a snail 's pace over her ear and cheek down to the corner of her mouth , Laur getting hotter and redder all the time as if she had steam inside her . It 's like falling off a cliff , standing astonished in mid - air as the horizon rushes away from you . If this is possible , anything is possible . Later we got stoned and made awkward , self - conscious love , but nothing that happened afterward was as important to me ( in an unhuman way ) as that first , awful wrench of the mind . 208 Once I felt the pressure of her hip - bone along my belly , and being very muddled and high , thought : She 's got an erection . Dreadful . Dreadful embarrassment . One of us had to be male and it certainly was n't me . Now they 'll tell me it 's because I 'm a Lesbian , I mean that 's why I 'm dissatisfied with things . That 's not true . It 's not because I 'm a Lesbian . It 's because I 'm a tall , blonde , blue - eyed Lesbian . Does it count if it 's your best friend ? Does it count if it 's her mind you love through her body ? Does it count if you love men 's bodies but hate men 's minds ? Does it count if you still love yourself ? Later we got better . VO Jeannine goes window - shopping . She has my eyes , my hands , my silly stoop ; she 's wearing my blue plastic raincoat and carrying my umbrella . Jeannine is out on the town on a Saturday afternoon saying goodbye , goodbye , goodbye to all that . Goodbye to mannequins in store windows who pretend to be sympathetic but who are really nasty conspiracies , goodbye to hating Mother , goodbye to the Divine Psychiatrist , goodbye to The Girls , goodbye to Normality , goodbye to Getting Married , goodbye to The Supernaturally Blessed Event , goodbye to being Some Body , goodbye to waiting for Him ( poor fellow ! ) , goodbye to sitting by the telephone , goodbye to feebleness , goodbye to adoration , goodbye Politics , hello politics . She 's scared but that 's all right . The streets are full of women and this awes her ; where have they all come from ? Where are they going ? ( If you do n't mind the symbolism . ) It 's stopped raining but mist coils up from the pavement . She passes a bridal shop where the chief mannequin , a Vision in white lace and tulle , sticks out her tongue at Jeannine . “

Jeannine shuts her um- 209 brella , latches it , and swings it energetically round and round . Goodbye . Goodbye . Goodbye to everything . We met in Schrafft 's and sat , the four of us , at one table , ordering their Thanksgiving dinner , argh , which is so traditional you ca n't stand it . Gah . “

Men do n't like places like this where the secret maintenance work of femininity is carried on , just as they turn green and bolt when you tell them medical events are occurring in your genito - urinary system . Jael has got something stuck between her steel teeth and her sham ones , and cocking an eye around Schrafft 's , she slips off her tooth cover and roots around for the blackberry seed or whatever , exposing to the world her steely , crocodilian grin .

I look around Schrafft 's and wonder why women at their most genteel are so miserly ; why is there no Four Seasons , no Maxim 's , no Chambord , for women ? Women are very strange about money , feudal almost : Real Money is what you spend on the house and on yourself ( except for your appearance ): Magic Money is what you get men to spend on you .

Jeannine , one cheek bulging like a squirrel 's , looks up as if surprised that we could hesitate to do business with Womanland . She nods briefly and then goes back to building mashedsweet - potato mountains with her fork . Jeannine now gets up late , neglects the housework until it annoys her , and plays with her food . "

96161	96184	96158	96158	you	2519	” Jael goes admiringly tsk tsk and makes a rueful face that means : my friend , you are really going it . “
96192	96202	96158	96158	you	2519	” says Jeannine in her high , sweet voice . “
96205	96230	96231	96231	You	2519	" ( Laur is waiting outside for Janet , probably baring her teeth at passing men . ) To Janet , Jael suddenly says : “

96241	96245	96231	96231	You	2519	" says Janet . “
96250	96257	96260	96260	you	2519	" Jael grins . She says : “

96433	96439	96430	96430	Janet	246	“ I do n't believe . ”
96510	96515	96517	96518	Alice Reasoner	500	" Think about it , ”
96520	96529	96530	96530	Janet	246	“ Go home and find out about it . ”
