278	282	283	283	he	59	" Why bother ? ”
286	322	283	283	he	59	“ You 're linked with them . If there was anything wrong with them , you would be the first to realize it . Why send a mute to find out what you already know ? ”
323	361	362	362	Rayal	59	" Because I 'll be able to see them through the mute 's memory when he comes back . I have n't seen either of them for over two years . Not since the youngest was born . "
367	376	364	364	his	59	“ Why do you want to see them ? ”
377	398	402	402	her	109	" I do n't know . There 's something ... not wrong , but PATTERNMASTER ... I do n't know . ”
414	423	402	402	her	109	“ Will you let me send a mute ? ”
424	443	445	445	he	59	“ Send an outsider . He 'll be better able to defend himself if the Clayarks notice him . ”
448	466	445	445	he	59	“ You should have more children . Perhaps then you would be less concerned for these two . "
519	532	533	533	she	109	“ You want me to have children by one of your outsiders ? ”
564	571	552	552	She	109	" By a journeyman , perhaps . ”
572	575	552	552	She	109	“ What ? "
576	593	552	552	She	109	" Have them by a journeyman , or at least an apprentice . Not an outsider . "
594	609	610	610	He	59	“ And which . . . journeyman or apprentice did you have in mind ? ”
658	663	664	664	he	59	“ Michael will do , ”
668	675	664	664	he	59	" Mich . . . Rayal ! ”
693	708	709	709	She	109	“ You asked me to choose someone for you . I 've chosen Michael . "
731	757	758	758	She	109	“ Someday when you promote Michael to journeyman and he can hear me PATTERNMASTER without embarrassment , I 'm going to tell him about this . ”
766	790	758	758	She	109	“ Then , husband , if you still insist that you will give me no more children , I will accept your choice . ”
820	855	809	809	He	114	" It 's for your own good that I refuse you . You 're really too much the mute - mother to have more children . You care too much what happens to them . ”
856	860	809	809	He	114	" I care . ”
861	893	809	809	He	114	“ And they 're going to kill each other . You 're so strong that even your child by a weaker man might be able to compete with our two sons . ”
894	904	809	809	He	114	“ They would n't have to kill each other . ”
935	961	962	963	Two brothers	120	” He felt her try to pull away from him and knew that he had won a point . He held her where she was . “
968	972	962	963	Two brothers	120	” he repeated . “
1001	1056	992	992	herself	123	” Now he let her go , but she lay still where she was . The Pattern rippled with her sorrow . It reflected her emotions almost as readily as it did his own . But unless he cooperated , it would not respond to her control . He spoke again to her gently . “
1083	1084	1102	1103	other wives	130	” “
1092	1096	1097	1097	You	0	” she said . “

1142	1158	1120	1131	Those PATTERNMASTER of my children who do n't compete to succeed me	131	" She was silent for a long while , her awareness focused on his face . “
1176	1177	1160	1160	you	0	" “
1194	1202	1185	1185	you	128	” There was more silence , then , “
1215	1216	1207	1207	I	0	" “
1223	1235	1220	1220	I	0	" She went on as though she had not heard him . “
1264	1294	1295	1295	You	128	” Rayal jerked the Pattern sharply and Jansee jumped , gasping at the sudden disturbance . It was comparable physically to a painless but startling slap in the face . "
1298	1302	1295	1295	You	128	” he said . “
1336	1378	1325	1327	Sister - wife	138	" Jansee radiated sudden anger . She thought of her sons fighting and her mind filled with bitter things to say about his power . But the pointlessness of verbalizing them to him , of all people , undermined her anger . “
1383	1388	1325	1327	Sister - wife	138	" she said sadly , “
1410	1414	1416	1416	you	140	” She paused . “
1429	1457	1418	1427	the group of mutes outside in front of the House	141	” This was not the change of subject that it seemed to be . He knew what she was leading up to but he let her go . “
1460	1461	1418	1427	the group of mutes outside in front of the House	141	” “
1469	1473	1462	1462	They	141	” she said . “
1483	1485	1486	1486	I	0	" PATTERNMASTER "
1498	1504	1486	1486	I	0	” She shook her head . “
1511	1512	1513	1513	Jansee	42	” “
1515	1516	1513	1513	Jansee	42	" “
1544	1545	1530	1530	you	140	” “
1585	1586	1581	1581	their	141	" “
1592	1597	1581	1581	their	141	” she said softly . “
1633	1634	1637	1637	you	140	” “
1640	1644	1637	1637	you	140	” He smiled . “
1667	1668	1637	1637	you	140	” "
1676	2402	1637	1637	you	140	” she said bitterly . The Clayarks chose that moment to end the year of peace . With an ancient gun of huge proportions , they stood on a hill just within sight of the lights of Rayal 's House . They had found the gun far south in territory that was exclusively their own . With rare patience and forethought , they had worked hard with it , cleaning it , coming to understand how it was supposed to work , repairing it , practicing with it . Then they dragged it to the House of the Patternmaster , their greatest enemy . It was unlikely that they would be able to use it more than once . Thus it would be effective only if they could use it against Rayal . Rayal 's sentries noticed them , but , lulled by the peace and unaware of the cannon , they paid no attention to Clayarks so far away . Thus the Clayarks had all the time their clumsy fingers needed to load their huge weapon , aim it , and fire . Their aim was good and they were very lucky . The first PATTERNMASTER shot smashed through the wall of the Patternmaster 's private apartment , beheading the Patternmaster 's lead wife and injuring the Patternmaster himself so severely about the head and shoulders that he was totally occupied for long important minutes with saving his own life . For all his power , he lay helpless . The people of his House were surprised enough , disoriented enough , to give the Clayarks time to fire again . But the destruction had excited the Clayarks . They abandoned the cannon to swarm down and finish the House in a more satisfying , personal way . CHAPTER ONE The sun had not been up long enough to burn off the cold dampness of morning when Teray and Iray left their dormitory room at Redhill School for the last time . Iray was all eagerness and apprehension and her emotions were contagious . Teray had resigned himself to being caught up in them . The act of leaving the school together not only reinforced their status as adults , but made them husband and wife . Teray had waited four wearisome years for the chance to leave safely and begin working toward his dream of founding his own House . Now , with Iray , he walked toward the main gate . There was no ceremony - not for their leaving school , nor for their marriage . Only two people paid any attention to their going . Teray sensed them both inside one of the dormitories , a Patternist girl who had been Iray 's friend and a middle - aged mute woman . They stood together at a dormitory window , looking down at Iray . The friend kept her feelings to herself , but the mute radiated such a mixture of sadness and excitement that Teray knew she and Iray must have been close . Iray was too full of her own emotions to be aware of the pair . Teray flashed her a brief mental image and she reached back , contrite , to say her good - byes . He sent back no parting thoughts of his own . He had PATTERNMASTER TRR had nothing to do with mutes for years . His maturing mental strength had made him too dangerous to them . For their sakes , he maintained only an impersonal master - servant relationship with them . And he had made few friends among his teachers and fellow students . They too were wary of his strength . He had been a power at the school , but except for Iray he had been much alone . Outside the main gate , he and Iray met the two men who had been waiting for them . The older man was of medium height and hard , square build , a man of obvious physical strength . The younger man was built more like Teray - tall and lean . He was probably no older than Teray . Joachim ! Teray 's thought went out to the older man . I did n't expect you to come yourself . The man smiled faintly and spoke aloud : “
2432	2448	2449	2449	Coransee	51	" Teray transmitted surprise : There 's been trouble , then ? Who was raided ? “
2475	2476	2467	2468	the raiders	152	” “
2479	2484	2477	2477	Coransee	51	” said Teray obediently . “
2491	2492	2494	2499	the most powerful one of us	155	” “
2501	2512	2494	2499	the most powerful one of us	155	” The man with Joachim spoke for the first time . “
2525	2526	2513	2514	The raiders	152	” "
2537	2541	2531	2531	they	152	” said Joachim . “
2549	2584	2546	2546	I	0	” Teray nodded , sharing the hope . Mutes who were not tortured to death and who did not die of the Clayark disease became the worst of their former - masters ' enemies . “
2595	2601	2585	2585	You	0	” he asked Joachim . PATTERNMASTER “
2612	2619	2607	2607	I	0	" Joachim gestured toward his companion . “
2628	2728	2620	2620	He	52	” Teray glanced at Jer with interest , wondering how the man 's strength measured up against his own . Through the Pattern , Teray had already sensed that Jer was strong . But how strong ? It was not possible to make a definite determination guided only by the Pattern . No doubt Joachim knew , though . He had probably tested Jer as thoroughly as he had tested Teray . And after the testing , he had made Jer an outsider and accepted Teray as an apprentice . Iray 's voice brought Teray out of his thoughts . “
2748	2759	2731	2731	Joachim	50	” Joachim glanced at her , his grim expression softening . “
2827	2828	2816	2816	they	43	" “
2839	2843	2816	2816	they	43	” said Jer , “
2881	3335	3336	3336	Joachim	50	” Teray noticed the pride in the man 's voice and wondered how Joachim could inspire pride even in an outsider . But then , Teray 's attitude toward outsider status was , he knew , colored by his desire never to occupy it . It was a permanently inferior servant position . The best that an outsider could hope for was to find a Housemaster like Joachim whom he could respect and serve with some semblance of pride . The worst he could get was slavery . 10 PATTERNMASTER The horses waited for them a few steps away in a grove of trees , and Teray noticed that Iray walked the distance beside Joachim . She , who only a few moments before had been so excited about leaving the school with Teray . True , she had known Joachim before she met Teray . The Housemaster had been her second when she made the difficult transition from childhood to adulthood and membership in the Pattern . She would probably have gone into his House as one of his wives if she had not met Teray . Now Teray watched them together with suspicion . He would spend at least two years with Joachim , learning , preparing to begin his own House . If only he did not lose his wife in the process . He came up beside Iray as they reached the horses . He touched her mind lightly with a one - word reminder careHis caution was lost on her . She seized his thought carelessly like a happy child and magnified it to a mental shout . To it , she added enthusiastically , Husband ! A proclamation . Joachim and Jer could hardly have missed it . He could feel their amusement as keenly as he could feel his own embarrassment . But at least she had told him what he wanted to know . And , fortunately , she had completely missed his meaning . Of course there was a bond between Iray and Joachim . But it was no more than the bond between any man and a woman he had seconded . Affection . No more . He cast around for a way to end the silence and focus Joachim 's and Jer 's attention elsewhere . It was then that he noticed the horse that Joachim had mounted . It was a show horse , of course , as were the three others . They were all as carefully bred and trained as most mutes . They were part of a project that Joachim had undertaken more for enjoyment PATTERNMASTER 11 than profit . But the one Joachim rode was something special . “
3341	3346	3347	3347	I	0	" The Housemaster smiled . “
3356	3390	3350	3350	Iray	48	" Teray let his curiosity be felt partly because he was actually curious , and partly in relief that Joachim too was ignorant of his foolish jealousy . But the horse . . . “
3401	3402	3391	3391	You	50	” “
3405	3463	3391	3391	You	50	” said Joachim . Gingerly , Teray felt the stallion out . Gingerly because animals , like mutes , were easily injured , easily killed . And too , uncontrolled animals unconsciously hit intruding Patternist minds with any emotions they felt . Especially violent emotions . But Teray received only calm from the horse . Unusual calm . “
3469	3473	3391	3391	You	50	" said Joachim . “
3542	3546	3547	3547	I	0	” Joachim grinned . "
3559	3898	3547	3547	I	0	” Teray nodded . Home . Joachim could not know how good that word sounded . The school had been Teray 's home for far too long . He had made his transition to adulthood nearly four years before . Even then , there had been little more that the teachers could teach him . But he had stayed , learning what he could about his abilities on his own , getting occasional help from a visiting Housemaster , waiting and hoping for a Housemaster who would accept him as an apprentice . Several had offered to take him on as an outsider . If he 12 PATTERNMASTER had not still been under the protection of the school , some of them might have been tempted to take him by force . Doubtless that would be possible now , while he was still young and unskilled . And if they took him now , they could prevent him from learning the skills that might make him a danger to them . But no one wanted to risk accepting him as an apprentice . An outsider was a permanent inferior . An apprentice was a potential superior . An apprentice was the young colt hanging around the edges of the herd , biding his time until he could kill off the old herd stallion and take over . Or at least that was the way the Housemasters he had met seemed to feel . It was much to Joachim 's credit that he had not been afraid . In fact , when Iray had introduced Teray to Joachim , the Housemaster had mentioned the possibility of an apprenticeship before Teray even thought it wise to bring up the matter . It took a confident , powerful Housemaster to accept an apprentice with Teray 's potential . But Joachim had had the necessary confidence and power , and now , finally , Teray was going home . Joachim had taken a lead position with Jer . Now he called back , “
3930	3937	3912	3912	He	186	” Iray caught her breath sharply . “
3954	3974	3977	3977	him	186	” She was a child about half the time . There was a pause before Joachim answered , then , “
3979	3985	3977	3977	him	186	” He sounded almost bitter . “
3996	4091	4092	4092	Joachim	50	" As the strongest Housemaster in the sector , Coransee was a kind of unofficial local leader . That made him a celebrity to people like Iray . Teray had heard him spoken of with admiration and envy , but never with bitterness . But then , PATTERNMASTER 13 Teray had been shut away in the school and people were careful what they said before schoolchildren . Well , he was out of school now . It would be best for him to know something more about the Housemaster he was about to visit . “
4094	4116	4117	4118	Lord Joachim	50	” he called . Joachim dropped back to ride beside Teray , leaving Jer to lead . You 'd better make it "
4120	4132	4117	4118	Lord Joachim	50	" Teray . For the rest of the day . And definitely “
4136	4211	4212	4212	Joachim	50	" He values formality . Teray accepted this with interest . It was the first nonvocal communication he had had with Joachim this morning , and it was nonvocal only to emphasize its seriousness . It was an order , and a warning . Joachim went on and Teray realized that he was reaching Iray too . Be introduced to him with Jer and me , then drift away among his women and outsiders . “
4218	4233	4234	4235	Lord Joachim	50	” Iray asked . Joachim looked at her silently , until she corrected herself . "
4237	4238	4234	4235	Lord Joachim	50	" “
4242	4247	4234	4235	Lord Joachim	50	” Joachim said aloud . "
4251	4489	4234	4235	Lord Joachim	50	” And he again took his place beside Jer . Teray watched him , wondering at his sudden reticence . Now Teray had more questions than ever . But Joachim 's silence was a closed one . It did not invite questions . By midday they had reached Coransee 's House . It was a four - story mansion , columned , ancient , ornate , surrounded by well - landscaped grounds and flanked by outbuildings . It had been built on a hill and was visible for miles . Teray could see why it was the envy of many lesser lords , and why Coransee had risked fighting a duel for it several years before . To get it , he had had to kill a powerful woman who had held it for over two decades . In school , Teray had seen pictures of ancient palaces that were probably smaller . 14 PATTERNMASTER Teray gazed out over Coransee 's land , seeing the wide pastures and the grazing horses and cattle . Coransee supplied the sector with most of its meat and its riding animals . The small herd that Joachim kept had never been more than a hobby . Two mutes hurried from one of the outbuildings to greet the four newcomers politely and take their horses . As Joachim led the way to the House , he warned Teray and Iray once more : “
4532	4954	4527	4527	I	0	" Teray nodded and Joachim led them inside . There were several women and outsiders seated and standing near the fireplace of the huge common room in which Teray found himself . Before Teray could decide what they were doing , one of them sent the informing thought , He knows you 're here . He 's coming . Joachim acknowledged with thanks and sat down . The others followed his example . Their wait was not long . The atmosphere of the room changed , grew tense as Coransee entered . The Housemaster radiated power in the way of a man not only confident but arrogant . A man who meant for people to stand in awe of him . A man Teray disliked instantly . The Pattern told Teray that he and Coransee were temperamentally incompatible . They could be said to be far apart in the Pattern . The reason for the distance might have been great temperamental dissimilarity , or dangerous similarity - similar inclinations toward dishonesty or greed , for instance . Whatever it was , it separated Teray and Coransee definitely , thoroughly . The four visitors stood up as the Housemaster entered . Coransee was a big man , tall , well - muscled , but without the heavy , stocky look of Joachim . Teray found himself staring PATTERNMASTER 15 at Coransee 's long cold face with a feeling that disturbed him because it was gone before he could recognize it . It took him a moment to realize that Coransee was looking at him in the same way . But Coransee was slower to cover his reaction . Teray had time to wonder whether what he had seen in the Housemaster 's eyes , and for an instant in his thoughts , was recognition . But whatever it was , it faded quickly into puzzlement . Then Coransee 's shield snapped into place and Teray got nothing more . Reflexively , Teray shielded his own thoughts but behind his shield he continued to wonder . Suddenly , as though in attack , Coransee drove his massive mental strength hard against Teray 's shield . He meant to break through it . There was no doubt of that . He had apparently seen something in Teray 's thoughts that caught his attention . He wanted another look . He did not get it ; Teray 's shield held firm . Before Teray could respond to the unprovoked attack , Joachim spoke up angrily . “
4980	5008	4966	4966	He	195	” For a moment Coransee stared at him in cold anger , stared at him as though he was an unwelcome intruder breaking into a private conversation . “
5014	5019	5020	5020	Your	51	” he said finally . "
5048	5058	5059	5059	You	51	” Joachim gave Teray no time to deny this . “
5063	5067	5059	5059	You	51	” he said . “
5085	5095	5096	5096	His	198	" Joachim took a deep breath , calmed himself . “
5112	5131	5132	5132	Teray	57	" Coransee nodded , acknowledging all three introductions at once . But his attention had fastened on Teray . “
5134	5146	5132	5132	Teray	57	” he repeated , drawing the word out thoughtfully . 16 PATTERNMASTER “
5163	5165	5149	5149	you	51	" The "
5167	5177	5178	5178	I	0	” rankled , but Teray pretended to ignore it . "
5192	5220	5221	5221	Rayal	59	" he answered . His name had attracted attention before but he had fought for it and won the right to keep it while still in school . “
5223	5229	5221	5221	Rayal	59	” Coransee raised an eyebrow . "
5260	5264	5265	5266	An adult	207	” Teray shrugged . “
5282	5283	5274	5274	I	0	” “
5296	5297	5293	5293	I	0	” "
5313	5314	5316	5316	she	209	” "
5318	5392	5316	5316	she	209	” Coransee 's attention seemed to wander . He had relaxed slightly , thinning his total shield down to a more comfortable heavy screen . For a moment , something flickered so close to the surface of his thoughts that Teray almost had it . He could have had it if he had dared to be obvious about his probing . But he let it pass . Abruptly , Coransee changed the subject . "
5402	5422	5423	5424	An artist	211	” The sudden switch obviously surprised Joachim as much as it did Teray . But Joachim was cautiously enthusiastic . “
5445	5446	5447	5447	I	0	” "
5450	5459	5447	5447	I	0	" For the first time , Coransee smiled . “
5471	5482	5483	5483	They	216	” Joachim began to draw in even his cautious enthusiasm . “
5510	5513	5497	5497	They	216	” PATTERNMASTER 17 "
5572	5573	5574	5574	Clayarks	43	" "
5576	5577	5574	5574	Clayarks	43	” “
5581	5582	5574	5574	Clayarks	43	” “
5599	5615	5616	5616	Laro	54	” Coransee turned toward the group of women and outsiders near the fireplace and called , “
5618	5759	5616	5616	Laro	54	” One of the outsiders in the group got up at once and came over to Coransee . He was a young man , probably only a few years older than Teray . Short and small - boned , he moved with quick , fluid grace . The Pattern betrayed him as a man of little mental strength . However competent he was at his art , he could never be anything more than an outsider . If he was lucky , his talent would buy him a comfortable place in someone else 's House , and he would be troubled by none of the competitive spirit that sent stronger people out to found Houses of their own . If he was unlucky and did have such spirit , it would soon get him killed . Coransee introduced the artist . "
5780	5789	5790	5791	My Lord	230	” Laro lowered his head and spoke respectfully . “
5793	6035	5790	5791	My Lord	230	” He was close to Joachim in the Pattern , Teray realized . That meant Joachim would probably buy him . Joachim 's people were able to form themselves into the deadly fighting machine that Clayarks avoided only because Joachim chose them so carefully . He chose them not only for their skill and strength , but for their compatibility within the Pattern . The Pattern was a vast network of mental links that joined every Patternist with the Patternmaster . Its first 18 PATTERNMASTER purpose was supposed to be to give the Patternmaster the strength he needed - strength drawn through the links from the Patternists — to combat large - scale Clayark attacks . Actually , though , the Pattern was more often used as Joachim used it , as Teray was using it now . To judge , roughly , the mental strength of other Patternists , and to judge , more precisely , their compatibility . Teray brought his attention back to the two Housemasters and realized that Coransee was listing the artlook as attractive as possible before they began talking about a price . Neither Housemaster was paying any attention to Teray , and Teray had no interest in the bargaining to come . He touched Iray lightly and started to go over to the group that Laro had left . Iray , evidently remembering Joachim 's instructions , started to follow . Coransee stopped them . “
6042	6063	6036	6036	Teray	57	” He smiled again . He had an open , friendly smile that Teray would have trusted on anyone else . “
6071	6317	6064	6065	View Laro	54	" A command disguised as an invitation . Caught , Teray and Iray came back slowly and sat down . Teray watched as the artist went past him and crossed the huge room to the group of women and outsiders that he had just left . From them he took three ceramic figurines and a small painting . Teray realized now why the group had seemed so absorbed . The artist had been entertaining them . Now Joachim 's party was to sample his work . Laro handed the painting to Joachim . The figurines went to Teray , Iray , and Jer . Teray first thought his was a wild animal . Not until he held it did he realize that the wellmuscled four - legged body was human - headed . The thing was a Clayark . Teray stared at it with interest . He had seen pictures of PATTERNMASTER 19 Clayarks at the school , but nothing as lifelike as this . His hands could almost feel warmth and a texture of flesh . He folded his hands around the figurine , closed his eyes , and opened his mind to whatever experience awaited him . He expected a jolt . He had prepared himself for it - but not nearly enough . Abruptly , shockingly , Teray was the Clayark . There was no time for anticipation , no disorientation . He felt himself seized and possessed by the artist - implanted “
6319	6975	6978	6978	you	232	” of the figurine . Fortunately , by the time Teray recovered enough to struggle , he had also recovered enough to know that he should not struggle . He was still the Clayark . He was within a torch - lit cave in the mountains far to the east of Redhill . He could see the rough gray - rock walls and the fire of the torches . He was a member of a munitions clan . His people made the rifles with which other Clayarks hunted food and fought Patternists . Now , though , his mind The sleek young female who stood apart from other onlookers , watching and holding her head so high - she was his . She was the daughter of his mother 's brother , and long promised to him . Only he had a right to her . Not this other , this dog with his long jowly muzzle of a face . The other , the challenger , was big both with fat and with muscle . Years of handling heavy metal weights had given him great strength . And years of stuffing his belly like a pig had made him slow As the Clayark , Teray bit and punched with heavily calloused hands - or forefeet . He seized and tore and gouged , all the while leaping about with speed and agility that his opponent could not match . All his opponent 's 20 PATTERNMASTER power was in his massive arms . Or forelegs . As long as the Clayark Teray could avoid those arms , he was safe . Then the Clayark Teray stumbled , and almost fell over a loose rock as he dodged one of his opponent 's clumsy swipes . His hand closed around the rock as he leaped away . He wheeled and charged again . This time he reared back on hind legs , which were more catlike than human . As his opponent reared eagerly to meet him and finally lay hands on him , Teray smashed the rock against the side of the creature 's head . Then he stood back in triumph and watched while his opponent died . Teray opened his eyes and stared at the small figurine in his hands . He could see its beauty , its perfection , even more clearly now . What was it the Clayarks called themselves ? Sphinxes . Creatures out of ancient mythology , lion - bodied , human - headed . The description was not really accurate . The Clayarks were furless and tailless , and they did possess hands . But they were much more sphinxes - creatures who were at least partly human - than they were the animals Teray had always considered them . And outsiders were not necessarily the inferior people Teray had considered them . The artist Laro had done something that Rayal himself could not have done . No Patternist could read the mind of a Clayark directly . The disease the Clayarks carried gave them at least that much protection from their Patternist enemies . And only the most sensitive artist could lift latent impressions of Clayarks from objects the Clayarks had touched . Laro not only lifted those impressions , he refined them , amplified them , and implanted them in his figurines and paintings . Teray caught the artists attention and sent him silent appreciation . Laro smiled . Jer and Iray had finished their experiences as Teray had . All three waited now as Joachim gazed silently at the painting . No sign of what he was experiencing appeared on his PATTERNMASTER 21 face , but they all could see that he was completely absorbed in the painting . Finally , Joachim 's show was over and he looked up . He put down the painting and turned to Coransee , his eagerness barely veiled . “
6983	7040	6978	6978	you	232	" Moments later , in Coransee 's office , Teray , Joachim , Laro , and Coransee himself were seated , waiting for Coransee to name his price . Joachim had tried to send Teray to entertain himself with more of Laro 's work , but Coransec had insisted on his sitting in on the bargaining . “
7046	7052	7053	7053	He	233	" the Housemaster had said . "
7062	7069	7070	7070	Joachim	50	” Then , about the trade : "
7142	7150	7151	7151	I	0	” At once , Laro spoke up . “
7183	7187	7169	7170	Lord Joachim	50	" Coransee nodded . “
7200	7208	7198	7198	Joachim	50	” Joachim leaned back in his chair . “
7221	7222	7216	7216	you	0	” "
7231	7235	7223	7223	I	0	” Coransee said . “
7253	7254	7247	7247	I	0	” "
7275	7279	7263	7263	I	0	” said Joachim . "
7320	7323	7307	7307	I	0	” 22 PATTERNMASTER "
7339	7376	7330	7330	Jer	52	” Coransee asked . Teray frowned . It seemed to him that the Housemaster was less serious than he should have been . Teray got the feeling that he had no interest at all in Jer . “
7381	7390	7377	7377	Jer	52	” said Joachim , going along with him . "
7407	7408	7409	7409	You	0	” “
7414	7419	7412	7412	Jer	52	” asked Coransee softly . "
7425	7426	7421	7421	you	0	” “
7434	7435	7427	7427	I	0	” “
7438	7439	7440	7440	I	0	” “
7475	7510	7463	7463	You	0	” Joachim looked uncomfortable . Coransee was playing with him . Dangling the artist temptingly before him , but refusing to name a price . And doing it all in a mildly insulting way . “
7528	7529	7519	7519	you	51	” “
7533	7537	7519	7519	you	51	” said Coransee . “
7548	7577	7541	7541	I	0	” The words were said so casually that it seemed to take Joachim a moment to digest them . More likely , though , Joachim used his moment of “
7580	7713	7714	7714	Coransee	51	” to think of a negative answer that would not close the trading . Teray looked from one man to the other . He had known what Coransee was going to say just an instant before he said it . Joachim had probably known too . Coransee had been a little too eager , had not concealed his thoughts as carefully as he might have . In his carelessness , he had permitted Teray to learn one other thing - a thing that was somehow part of the reason why the Housemaster wanted PATTERNMASTER 23 Teray badly enough to trade a talent like Laro 's . A talent that had surely cost him several of his people . But perhaps it would not matter . Already Joachim was turning down the offer . “
7759	7760	7752	7752	I	0	” “
7769	7790	7766	7766	you	0	” Coransee spoke lazily , as though he had gotten the answer he expected and was merely playing another game . “
7839	7895	7896	7896	You	50	" Surprisingly , Joachim seemed to reconsider for a moment . Teray , watching him , felt the beginnings of fear . He had waited so long to avoid being taken as an outsider . If now , on his first day out of the school , all his waiting was to prove in vain ... "
7902	7907	7896	7896	You	50	” Joachim was saying . "
7932	7933	7930	7930	myself	0	” “
7964	7965	7966	7969	Even a miniature Pattern	254	” “
7976	7977	7978	7978	I	0	” "
7983	7987	7988	7988	I	0	” said Coransee . “
8003	8011	8012	8012	You	50	” Joachim made a sound of disgust . “
8038	8039	8031	8031	you	50	” "
8052	8060	8047	8050	Patternmaster 24 PATTERNMASTER Rayal	59	” Teray spoke for the first time . “
8067	8105	8106	8106	You	50	” His questions were not really questions but he looked toward Coransee as though expecting him to answer . Coransee stared at him blankly for a moment . Then he smiled without humor and spoke to Joachim . “
8131	8136	8127	8127	he	195	" And to Teray , “
8148	8195	8197	8197	your	0	” By now Teray knew that he had made a mistake . He should have kept his findings - and the strength and stealth of his probe - to himself . But it was too late now . No lie would get past an alerted Coransee . "
8207	8208	8197	8197	your	0	” “
8218	8240	8212	8212	you	0	" Coransee 's voice that made Teray shut out the urgent warnings Joachim was sending and answer in his own way . “
8250	8258	8248	8248	Lord	265	” Something hardened in Coransee 's voice . “
8281	8526	8279	8279	you	0	” Teray ! Joachim finally managed to make his thought felt . Stay out of this ! You do n't know what you 're doing . The more you antagonize him , the less chance we have . I wo n't become his outsider , Joachim . Teray screened heavily , protecting the thought from Coransee 's interception . You will if you do n't stop talking and let me handle it . I 've got the rest of the day to talk him out of it . He wo n't be talked out of it . He 's made up his mind . I 'm going to have to face him sooner or later , no matter what . If you 're foolish enough to attack him , Teray , I 'll help PATTERNMASTER 25 him against you myself . Now be quiet and fade into the background with Laro ! The intensity of Joachim 's anger burned into Teray . He had no doubt that the Housemaster was completely serious . The dialogue had taken place in only a few seconds , so there had been no more of a pause in his conversation with Coransee than Coransee 's last question deserved . Now he still had to answer that question and do it in a way that would not lead to his deeper involvement . Somehow . He was about to speak when Joachim took the matter out of his hands . “
8540	8570	8528	8528	you	268	” he asked angrily . Coransee turned slowly to look at Joachim . Teray was startled at the relief he felt to have the man 's eyes off him . “
8585	8589	8575	8576	the boy	270	” asked Coransee . "
8595	8610	8593	8593	yourself	268	” Joachim ran the words on both the vocal and mental level for emphasis . “
8633	8634	8630	8631	the artist	1322	” “
8638	8669	8630	8631	the artist	1322	” Coransee agreed . Teray wondered , under his renewed fear , how it felt to Joachim to have his most serious words answered with no more than mild amusement . "
8689	8835	8682	8682	he	270	” Teray said nothing , sent no parting thought as he left the office . Coransee 's casual undetected eavesdropping into his conversation with Joachim was no more than payment for his own earlier snooping . But it angered him . No one should have been able to bypass his screens so easily without being noticed . He had been careless himself . It would not happen again . He located Iray as quickly as he could , then managed to 26 PATTERNMASTER find a private corner where he could tell her what had happened . She heard him , her eyes widening with disbelief as he spoke . Then before she could respond , a mute interrupted them with an offer of cool drinks and food . . . . It was the first time he could recall her being harsh with a mute . “
8845	8853	8682	8682	he	270	" Teray , what are you saying ? "
8857	8861	8682	8682	he	270	” he ordered . “
8875	8881	8882	8882	Iray	48	" But Joachim would n't ... “
8884	8892	8882	8882	Iray	48	” She switched in mid - sentence . "
8921	8922	8905	8905	You	48	" "
8941	8942	8934	8934	I	0	" “
8946	8947	8948	8948	I	0	” "
8953	8957	8948	8948	I	0	" Teray frowned . “
8981	8982	8948	8948	I	0	” “
8989	8990	8991	8991	I	0	” "
9000	9001	8995	8995	I	0	" "
9023	9024	9025	9025	He	276	” “
9053	9054	9039	9039	He	276	” “
9072	9081	9083	9083	he	276	" She shook her head angrily , bitterly . “
9094	9105	9106	9106	Joachim	50	” She stood leaning against him , radiating her anger . “
9113	9117	9118	9118	He	50	” she said . "
9141	9144	9145	9145	I	0	” PATTERNMASTER 27 "
9177	9178	9179	9179	He	50	” "
9189	9190	9183	9183	He	50	” "
9209	9231	9203	9203	He	50	” She opened her mouth to protest again , to defend Joachim . Then she closed it and lowered her head . “
9239	9266	9237	9237	Teray	57	” She seemed to surrender to the fear that she had been holding at bay with her anger . She pressed herself against him , trembling . “
9276	9280	9269	9269	you	57	” she whispered . “
9285	9704	9269	9269	you	57	” He said nothing , only looked at her . He knew which restriction she had in mind . There were several : outsiders were not free to father children as they wished , and of course they had little or no say in where they lived or how long they lived there . They were property . But the restriction Iray had in mind was the one that said outsiders could not marry . They were free enough to have all the sex they wanted with any woman in the House who would have them - as long as they were careful to father no unauthorized offspring . But if , as in Teray 's case , a man was married before he lost his freedom , his wife took her place among the women of the House , the Housemaster 's wives . And she became the only woman in the House permanently forbidden to her former husband . The laws were old , made in harsher times . Perhaps it was reasonable , as the old records said , to forbid weak men to sire potentially weak children . But what reason could there be for denying a man access to his chosen one , his first , while permitting him so many others ? What reason but to remind him constantly that he was a slave ? Teray drew a ragged breath . No matter why the laws had been made , they were still in effect , being used every day . 28 PATTERNMASTER Now , if Joachim failed him , they would be used against him . No , he had chosen Joachim as well as been chosen by him . He knew the man . Iray was right . Joachim would not make the trade . When they had talked for a while longer , Teray assuring say that Joachim had decided to stay the night . They had been assigned a room . If they wished to go there now ... They had dinner in their room that night , served by a without bothering them . The girl was on her way out when , finally , Joachim came to see them . The mute girl smiled at him and continued out of the room . Joachim watched silently until she closed the door behind her . Then he crossed the room to them , still silent . Teray stood up . Joachim faced him , met his eyes . "
9711	9712	9709	9709	Teray	57	” “
9715	9725	9709	9709	Teray	57	” Teray repeated the word mechanically , then explosively : "
9738	9739	9728	9728	You	0	” “
9742	9743	9744	9744	Joachim	50	” “
9766	9772	9773	9773	She	48	“ You 've betrayed us . ”
9780	9788	9773	9773	She	48	“ After I introduced you to Teray . ”
9789	9796	9797	9797	Teray	57	“ How could you do it ? ”
9800	9807	9808	9808	Joachim	50	“ Why would you do it ? "
9819	9834	9808	9808	Joachim	50	“ You heard him . He wanted you . I could n't stop him . "
9835	9845	9773	9773	She	48	“ Then why did n't you let me try ? ”
9846	9855	9856	9856	Joachim	50	“ You can try if you want to . ”
9862	9907	9858	9858	his	50	“ You probably will , sooner or later , because he wants you to . He wants to know just how strong you are . PATTERNMASTER 29 And he wants you to know his strength . He wants to put you in your place . ”
9908	9921	9773	9773	She	48	" You 're so sure that I have no chance against him ? "
9922	9968	9969	9969	He	283	“ No chance at all . In a few years , maybe , when you 've had more training , more experience , when you learn more control . But now ... he 'll humiliate you before the rest of his House , before Iray . ”
9974	9981	9969	9969	He	283	" And that will be that . ”
9982	9994	9996	9996	Iray	48	“ That 's already that as far as you 're concerned , ”
10002	10017	10018	10018	Her	48	" After all , you 've sold us , and you 've been paid . "
10029	10042	10043	10043	Joachim	50	“ You 're sorry ! What do you want ? Our forgiveness ? ”
10047	10063	10043	10043	Joachim	50	“ I tried . I did everything I could to make him change his mind . "
10064	10097	10098	10098	She	48	" I do n't believe that . Either you wanted the artist and you did what was necessary to get him , or you let Coransee frighten you into making the trade . ”
10104	10115	10098	10098	She	48	" You are afraid of him , are n't you ? ”
10139	10146	10148	10148	Joachim	50	" I 'm afraid for Teray , ”
10151	10156	10148	10148	Joachim	50	" and for you . ”
10157	10162	10164	10164	Teray	57	“ Then help us , ”
10166	10176	10164	10164	Teray	57	“ We need your help , not your fear ! "
10177	10184	10148	10148	Joachim	50	" I ca n't help you . "
10185	10217	10148	10148	Joachim	50	" You mean you wo n't help us . No one outsider is worth the trouble you could give him for taking me . You would n't even have to fight . ”
10218	10237	10164	10164	Teray	57	“ Teray , it does n't have to be as bad as you think , being an outsider . ”
10246	10285	10242	10242	Joachim	50	“ If you can just accept it , stop fighting Coransee , he can teach 30 PATTERNMASTER you more than I ever could . And he 's not as far from you in the Pattern as you think . ”
10286	10295	10164	10164	Teray	57	“ And what about me , My Lord ? "
10312	10338	10339	10339	Joachim	50	" Will it also be ' not as bad as I think ' with my husband forbidden to me , and his slaver my owner ! "
10380	10397	10364	10364	He	50	“ If I could help , do you think you would even have to ask me ? "
10408	10419	10400	10400	him	50	" Tell us why you ca n't help , Joachim . ”
10460	10468	10469	10469	he	50	" You know , do n't you ? ”
10473	10510	10469	10469	he	50	“ You 're too good . You see too much . It got you into trouble this afternoon . Finished any hope I might have had of talking Coransee out of the trade . Too good . ”
10511	10520	10521	10521	Teray	57	“ Tell us why you ca n't help , "
10538	10554	10555	10555	Joachim	50	" I wonder how long it will take him to make an outsider of you , ”
10561	10565	10558	10558	Teray	57	" All right ! ”
10577	10605	10572	10572	himself	50	“ I 'm conditioned . . . controlled ! That special horse of mine has more freedom than I have when it comes to dealing with Coransee . ”
10613	10624	10606	10606	Iray	48	“ Controlled ? Like a mute ? Like an animal ? ”
10625	10628	10632	10632	he	50	" Iray ! "
10667	10682	10683	10683	Teray	57	“ Do you know why I allowed him to plant his controls , Teray ? "
10695	10737	10691	10691	He	57	" Because I was n't as patient as you were . Because I left the school too soon . And I left alone except for my wife . Coransee picked me up , forced me into his House as an outsider . ”
10741	10840	10738	10738	Joachim	50	“ So you see , I know what you 're both going through . I had been with him seven years when he offered me a chance for freedom . I had to cooperate with him , let him plant his controls in my mind . It 's delicate work - the planting . Not like just linking with someone . As strong as he is , even he could n't have done it if I had resisted . So I did n't resist . By then , I would have done anything to get free . Anything . "
10841	10850	10851	10851	Teray	57	“ You call what you have now freedom ? "
10859	10862	10864	10864	Joachim	50	“ Yes ! ”
10867	10878	10864	10864	Joachim	50	“ So will you after a few years of captivity . ”
10895	10941	10942	10942	He	50	" No . I 've been ' free ' for years now and Coransee 's controls have been in place every minute . He does n't need my cooperation to hold them . I think I 'll wear them for the rest of my life . "
10945	10965	10942	10942	He	50	“ He does n't use them often . But when he does , there 's nothing I can do . "
11027	11110	11021	11021	he	50	“ Teray , you were wise enough to stay under the protection of the school until you were accepted for apprenticeship . You were careful . You did everything right . Yet through my weakness and Coran- 32 PATTERNMASTER see 's dishonesty , you 've lost your wife and your freedom . All while you were supposed to be under my protection . No matter what hold Coransee has on me , I ca n't just go away and forget about you . ”
11111	11117	11118	11118	Teray	57	“ What will you do ? ”
11128	11158	11159	11159	Joachim	50	“ I ca n't do anything directly . You know that . But indirectly , I 'll do everything I can , including an appeal to Rayal if necessary . ”
11177	11191	11196	11196	him	50	“ Teray , believe me , I 'll get you away from him . ”
11214	11221	11222	11222	Joachim	50	“ Good - bye , Joachim . ”
11276	11284	11285	11285	she	48	“ What are you going to do ? "
11288	11294	11285	11285	she	48	" I do n't know . ”
11313	11322	11323	11323	She	48	“ I do n't know . Maybe tomorrow ... "
11329	11345	11326	11326	her	48	" Now , Teray . Do n't you feel it ? Coransee is coming now . ”
11553	11560	11542	11542	He	51	“ Now , eh , brother ? ”
11566	11570	11572	11572	Coransee	51	“ Bad timing , ”
11574	11621	11622	11622	He	51	" You 're tired and emotionally drained . You should have chosen to wait . I would have let you spend the night here with Iray like a was 34 PATTERNMASTER guest , and you could have fought me in the morning when you were rested . ”
12444	12447	12448	12448	She	48	" Iray ... "
12456	12472	12448	12448	She	48	" Did n't I see ? Do n't you think I know what you feel ? ”
12578	12587	12588	12588	he	57	" I 'll get us out of this , ”
12591	12595	12588	12588	he	57	“ I swear ... "
12596	12599	12628	12628	her	48	" Teray ... "
12600	12608	12588	12588	he	57	" I wo n't stop trying until _ ”
12610	12621	12622	12622	He	57	“ Teray , listen ! There 's a way out . ”
12630	12633	12622	12622	He	57	“ What ? ”
12634	12695	12588	12588	he	57	“ Listen . Coransee said you were to report to him tomorrow . . . tomorrow morning . He said he might make you his apprentice . You 're stronger than he thought . He said you 'd make a better ally than servant . Teray , he said I might . .. we might be able to stay together . ”
12697	12700	12622	12622	He	57	“ Might ? ”
12701	12741	12622	12622	He	57	" He wants to talk to you . I do n't know why . And he said he had to find out something from the school . But we have a chance , Teray . At least a chance . "
12742	12767	12622	12622	He	57	“ Maybe . But what is there to talk about - or find out ? Either I 'm an apprentice or I 'm not . ”
12768	12795	12622	12622	He	57	“ You could learn more from him than from Joachim . Much more . And maybe you 'd be able to have your own House sooner . ”
12802	12828	12798	12798	his	57	“ Love , do n't put so much of your trust in him . I do n't know what he has in mind , but ... "
12829	12841	12842	12842	She	304	“ Teray , whatever it is , go along with him . ”
12854	12884	12842	12842	She	304	“ Please . Go along with him . I do n't want to be a thing won in a fight . I want to be your wife . Please . ”
12891	12912	12885	12885	He	57	“ Do you think I 'd miss a chance - any real chance - to get what we both want ? ”
13263	13273	13260	13260	Coransee	51	" Have you ever seen our father , Teray ? "
13280	13283	13260	13260	Coransee	51	" No . "
13284	13312	13313	13313	Teray	57	" I thought not . You look like him , though - much more than I do . That 's what caught my attention about you yesterday . ”
13383	13394	13396	13396	Coransee	51	" You and I are full brothers , you know , ”
13420	13436	13403	13403	I	0	” Teray shrugged . He knew nothing of his mother . Rayal had many wives . "
13449	13474	13440	13440	Jansee	42	” PATTERNMASTER 39 Teray froze , a forkful of steak halfway to his mouth . He put down the fork and looked at Coransee . “
13480	13481	13440	13440	Jansee	42	” “
13486	13487	13440	13440	Jansee	42	” "
13495	13496	13489	13489	you	0	" "
13508	13576	13577	13577	Lord	265	" Teray turned his attention back to his food , not wanting to be reminded of his defeat . The informality of the scene suddenly seemed incongruous to him . He had expected to stand before Coransee 's desk like an errant schoolboy and listen to the Housemaster 's sarcasm . Yet here he was having breakfast with Coransee . And not once had he called the Housemaster "
13579	13607	13577	13577	Lord	265	” Nor would he , Teray decided . He might as well find out now just how far he could go . What could Coransee possibly want ? "
13612	13616	13577	13577	Lord	265	” said Coransee , “
13637	13638	13632	13633	our father	1454	" "
13643	13644	13645	13645	He	1454	" "
13654	13658	13645	13645	He	1454	” said Coransee . “
13670	13671	13664	13664	you	341	" “
13695	13696	13697	13697	He	1454	” “
13700	13711	13712	13712	He	1454	” Teray ate silently , refusing to ask more questions . "
13726	13736	13712	13712	He	1454	” said Coransee . He lowered his voice slightly . "
13745	13746	13738	13738	you	341	” "
13759	13760	13747	13747	You	341	" “
13767	13768	13769	13769	I	0	" "
13774	13775	13769	13769	I	0	” “
13792	13793	13785	13785	I	0	" “
13808	13809	13798	13798	You	341	” "
13828	13970	13822	13822	you	341	” 40 PATTERNMASTER Teray said nothing for a long moment . He had never really thought that he had a chance to succeed Rayal . The Patternmaster simply had too many children , a number of them not only older but , like Coransee , already Masters of their own Houses . Clearly , though , Coransee thought Teray had a chance - and was now demanding that he give up that chance . Teray had no doubt that Coransee could and would kill him if he refused . If the Housemaster was not actually stronger - and that was still in doubt - he was more versatile , more experienced . And if it was possible for Teray to live the kind of life he had planned for himself without fighting , he would rather not challenge his brother again . "
13976	14001	13971	13971	I	0	” he said quietly . The words were surprisingly difficult to say . To be Master of the Pattern , to hold such power ... “
14012	14020	14002	14002	I	0	" Coransee looked across at him calculatingly . “
14029	14055	14022	14022	I	0	” Teray tried to conceal his sudden excitement . He met Coransee 's eyes with simulated calm . Was it going to be this easy ? "
14063	14067	14060	14061	your apprentice	198	” Coransee nodded . “
14075	14079	14069	14069	I	0	” he said , "
14092	14093	14069	14069	I	0	" "
14096	14097	14069	14069	I	0	” “
14219	14258	14259	14259	Teray	57	" Now , to prevent that from happening again , I want to leave you here at Redhill . When the time comes , I 'll have to move to Forsyth , to the House of the Patternmaster . ”
14273	14279	14267	14267	Coransee	51	“ Brother . . . ? "
14280	14326	14327	14327	Teray	57	" You 've understood me , I see . When the pattern is mine , this House will be yours . I 'll take from it only the closest of my wives , and a few outsiders . The rest I will leave to you . "
14346	14362	14327	14327	Teray	57	“ You offer me all this at no cost ? You give it to me ? ”
14363	14371	14267	14267	Coransee	51	“ What price could you pay me ? ”
14372	14383	14267	14267	Coransee	51	“ None . You 're right . I have nothing . "
14384	14392	14393	14393	He	57	“ Then you have nothing to lose . ”
14396	14413	14393	14393	He	57	“ I do ask something . But it 's not what you would call a price . ”
14431	14487	14423	14423	Coransee	51	" It 's more like a guarantee . Brother , I have to know that when you 're older and more experienced you wo n't decide that you gave up the Pattern too easily . I have to be certain that you 'll be content as a Housemaster and not decide to try for Patternmaster . ”
14488	14494	14496	14496	Teray	57	“ I 've said it , ”
14498	14515	14496	14496	Teray	57	" I 'll open to you , let you see for yourself that I mean it . ”
14516	14555	14423	14423	Coransee	51	“ I already know you mean it . I know you are n't lying to me . But a man can change . What you believe now might not be worth anything five or ten years from now . ”
14556	14577	14496	14496	Teray	57	" But you 'd hold the Pattern by then . You could stop me from any attempt to usurp . . "
14578	14601	14602	14602	Teray	57	" Perhaps I could — and perhaps not . But I 'm not about to wait and find out the hard way . "
14651	14663	14665	14665	Coransee	51	" I want you alive for the sake of the people , ”
14667	14740	14665	14665	Coransee	51	“ We 've got Clayarks chewing at the borders of every sector from the desert to the northern islands . They know Rayal has been too much concerned with keeping himself alive to give proper attention to raiders . When he finally gives up the power and dies , I mean for the people to have security again . But I wo n't permit you to be a threat to my security . ”
14741	14748	14750	14750	Teray	57	" I 'm not a threat , ”
14753	14772	14750	14750	Teray	57	“ You know what assurance I want , brother . Your words are n't worth anything to me . ”
14773	14787	14665	14665	Coransee	51	“ You 're asking me to step from physical slavery into mental slavery ! "
14788	14819	14665	14665	Coransee	51	“ I 'm offering you everything you claim to want . Are you getting ambitious already ? My controls would do nothing other than make certain you kept your word . ”
14820	14830	14750	14750	Teray	57	" Joachim told me how you use your controls . ”
14831	14834	14835	14835	Coransee	51	" Joachim ! ”
14844	14875	14835	14835	Coransee	51	" Believe me , brother , Joachim needs the controls I keep on him . Without them , he would never have succeeded in taking a House of his own . ”
14876	14885	14750	14750	Teray	57	“ How could he , as your outsider ? ”
14886	14908	14750	14750	Teray	57	" He became my outsider through his own bad judgment . Just as he accepted you for apprenticeship through bad judgment . "
14909	14941	14835	14835	Coransee	51	“ You mean because he was n't as suspicious of me as you are ? Because he believed me when I let him see that I was n't after his House ? ”
14942	15012	14750	14750	Teray	57	“ Teray , the moment he realized that you are stronger than he is — you are , by the way , and he knew it - he should have dropped you . That 's common sense . When you 're Master of your own House , see how you feel about acceptPATTERNMASTER 43 ing an underling who just might learn enough from you to snatch your House away . "
15013	15026	14750	14750	Teray	57	" Did you help Joachim win his House from its previous Master ? ”
15027	15037	14835	14835	Coransee	51	" Indirectly . I gave him some special training . "
15038	15049	15050	15050	Coransee	51	“ But why ? And why keep control of him ? "
15059	15063	15064	15064	he	356	“ Sector politics , "
15068	15096	15064	15064	he	356	“ I wanted to be certain of a majority vote on the Redhill Council of Masters . Joachim 's predecessor opposed me very loudly , very stupidly . ”
15105	15112	15113	15113	he	57	“ I do n't oppose you , "
15116	15148	15113	15113	he	57	" How can I ? But I ca n't pay your price either . I ca n't bargain away my mental freedom , sentence myself to a lifetime of mental slavery . "
15149	15159	15102	15102	Teray	57	" How free do you think you are now ? ”
15160	15171	15102	15102	Teray	57	" Free at least to think what I want to . ”
15172	15212	15213	15213	Teray	57	“ I see . Well , since you put so much stock in promises , I 'd be willing to give you my word that I wo n't interfere with your thinking except to stop you from usurping power . "
15226	15387	15222	15222	Coransee	51	“ I see you 're less naïve than you pretend to be . Thank heavens for that . But listen , brother , noble lies aside , just how much control over you do you think I want ? You 'd live your everyday life as free mentally as you are now . Why not ? I have n't the time nor the inclination to meddle into the petty details of someone else 's life . The only thing you would n't be free to do is oppose me . All my controls would do is put you at the same level as everyone else , once I 'm Patternmaster . You 'll be different only in that your strength makes it necessary for me to have an extra hold on you - a hold beyond the Pattern . You have no more reason to object to my controls than you have to object to your link with the Pattern . "
15388	15404	15405	15405	Teray	57	“ The Pattern is different . It does n't control anyone 's 44 PATTERNMASTER thinking . ”
15414	15452	15405	15405	Teray	57	" Even if I thought I could trust you - even if you were Joachim , whom I did trust - I could n't accept the leash , the brand that you want to put on me . ”
15453	15461	15462	15462	Coransee	51	“ Not even to save your life ? ”
15479	15482	15405	15405	Teray	57	“ No ! "
15516	15521	15511	15511	he	57	" I ca n't . ”
15548	15576	15537	15537	he	57	“ What 's the point of buying my life with the one thing I still have that makes it worth living ? Go ahead and kill me . ”
15585	15623	15582	15582	his	51	“ I wish I had read you less correctly , brother . I thought that was what you would say . I will give you as much time as our father has left to change your mind . ”
15662	15675	15677	15677	Coransee	51	“ I can only accept you as an apprentice on my terms , ”
15679	15703	15704	15704	He	51	" Until you accept those terms , you remain an outsider , subject to all the outsider restrictions and observing all the formalities . "
15707	15711	15704	15704	He	51	“ You understand . ”
15712	15720	15736	15736	he	57	“ I. . . yes , Lord . ”
15778	15784	15785	15785	Coransee	51	“ As for your work , ”
15788	15818	15785	15785	Coransee	51	“ one of my muteherds is due a promotion . He 's in charge of the mutes PATTERNMASTER who maintain the House and grounds . You will replace him . ”
15819	15823	15824	15824	Teray	57	" A muteherd ? ”
15860	15865	15867	15867	Coransee	51	" That 's right , ”
15869	15889	15867	15867	Coransee	51	“ And you start today . Jackman , the man you 're replacing , is waiting for you now . ”
15890	15899	15942	15942	He	65	“ But , Lord , mutes . . . "
15900	15929	15930	15930	Jackman	65	“ Mutes ! Damage them with your strength , and when you recover from the beating I 'll surely give you , you 'll find yourself herding cattle . ”
16021	16027	16028	16028	he	65	" Son of a bitch , ”
16031	16051	16028	16028	he	65	“ If you 're not even - tempered , you 're going to kill every mute in the House . ”
16135	16149	16150	16150	Jackman	65	" I 'm taking her with me , if you do n't mind , ”
16153	16157	16159	16159	Teray	57	“ Your business , "
16161	16165	16159	16159	Teray	57	“ And yours . ”
16180	16191	16175	16176	PATTERNMASTER man	375	“ Every mute in the House is your business now . "
16203	16214	16215	16215	he	57	“ You care about the mutes , do n't you ? ”
16219	16234	16215	16215	he	57	" I mean really care . It was n't just a job to you . "
16235	16274	16175	16176	PATTERNMASTER man	375	" I care . Right now I 'm downright worried about them . I 'm afraid you 're going to wind up killing some of them out of sheer ignorance before you find out how to handle them . ”
16275	16281	16282	16282	Teray	57	" Frankly , so am I. ”
16291	16347	16288	16288	Jackman	65	“ Look , they 're people , man . Powerless and without mental voices , but still people . So for God 's sake try to be careful . To me , killing one of them is worse than killing one of us , because they ca n't do a damn thing to defend themselves . ”
16348	16364	16365	16365	Jackman	65	" Will you show me what you know about them - how you handled them ? ”
16371	16382	16365	16365	Jackman	65	“ I 'll teach you what I can , sure . ”
16383	16391	16288	16288	Jackman	65	“ That is n't what I meant . "
16392	16414	16288	16288	Jackman	65	" I did n't think it was . What the hell gives you the idea you 're entitled to anything more ? ”
16415	16441	16365	16365	Jackman	65	" I 'm not entitled . I just thought you might be willing to do the one thing you could do to safeguard your mutes . "
16442	16472	16288	16288	Jackman	65	" Your mutes ! My mental privacy does n't have a goddamn thing to do with it . Nobody but Coransee can make me do what you 're asking . "
16473	16510	16288	16288	Jackman	65	“ And I would n't ask it if other people 's lives were n't involved . But I honestly do n't want to kill any of these mutes . And without your help , I will . "
16511	16519	16521	16521	Jackman	65	“ You 're asking for my memories , "
16523	16550	16521	16521	Jackman	65	“ And you know as well as I do that you 're going to wind up with a lot more than just my memories of muteherding . "
16551	16571	16572	16572	PATTERNMASTER	65	“ There 's no other method of teaching that 's fast enough to keep me from doing some damage . ”
16574	16583	16572	16572	PATTERNMASTER	65	" Nosing into my life is n't teaching . ”
16641	16652	16630	16630	He	57	“ You two leave us alone for a few minutes . "
16668	16676	16677	16677	Jackman	65	“ Do n't hold it against them , ”
16684	16700	16677	16677	Jackman	65	“ They 've looked to me for orders for five years . It 's habit . ”
16701	16719	16677	16677	Jackman	65	“ Jackman , open to me voluntarily . I do n't want to have to force you . "
16720	16727	16728	16728	He	57	“ You 've got no right ! ”
16945	16948	16949	16949	he	57	" Jackman , "
16952	17061	16949	16949	he	57	" I 'm Coransee 's brother - full brother . I might be second to him in strength here , but I do n't think I 'm second to anyone else . Now I know you 're worried about having a rough time when you move to the third floor , and you 're right to be . You 're almost as weak as one of your mutes , and you 're going to be everyone 's pawn . If you want to , you can keep a link with me . After a couple of people try me out , no one will bother either of us . ”
17062	17077	17078	17078	Teray	57	" After what you just did , you think I 'd hide behind you ? ”
17098	17115	17117	17117	Jackman	65	" You 're trying to bribe me to keep my mouth shut about what you did , ”
17119	17135	17117	17117	Jackman	65	“ Coransee'd make you think you were being skinned alive if I went to him . "
17226	17249	17352	17352	Teray	57	" If there was any way for me to kill you , boy , I 'd do it gladly . And slowly . "
17250	17256	17258	17258	Teray	57	“ I 've linked us , ”
17260	17329	17352	17352	Teray	57	“ If you get into trouble , I 'll know . If I find that you caused the trouble to make trouble for me , I 'll let you be torn apart . But if you did n't cause it , and you want my help , I 'll help you . Nothing else . The link is n't a control or a snoop . Just an alarm . ”
17330	17351	17352	17352	Teray	57	" Like the kind some Patternist mothers keep on their kids to be sure the kids are okay , right ? ”
17380	17391	17393	17393	Jackman	65	“ May as well call a thing what it is , ”
17395	17418	17393	17393	Jackman	65	“ The minute you decide you do n't want the link , you can dissolve it . Right now if you like . ”
17470	17487	17463	17463	He	57	“ You 're not really doing this to bribe me to be quiet , are you ? ”
17488	17494	17496	17496	Teray	57	" It does n't matter , "
17502	17542	17498	17498	Jackman	65	“ You 're doing it to soothe your conscience , are n't you ? Doing it to blot out the ' bad thing you did before . You never really left the goddamn school , did you , kid ? ”
17754	17759	17760	17760	he	65	“ Conscience or not , ”
17764	17772	17760	17760	he	65	" you 're his brother all right . ”
18250	18256	18257	18257	he	57	" I 've failed you , ”
18261	18273	18257	18257	he	57	“ Again . I could n't pay the price Coransee asked . ”
18316	18328	18329	18329	He	57	“ Tell me what happened . Tell me all of it . ”
18478	18488	18489	18489	Her	48	“ Are you going to let him kill you ? ”
18498	18511	18489	18489	Her	48	“ Of course not ! I would n't let anyone kill me ! "
18512	18520	18489	18489	Her	48	“ What are you going to do ? ”
18521	18561	18562	18562	He	57	" Fight . . . again . If it comes to that . I 'm not going to waste the time he 's given me . I 'm going to learn whatever I can . Maybe learn enough to ... "
18631	18641	18642	18642	she	48	" I 'm not going to change my name , "
18662	18682	18642	18642	she	48	“ You 're going to do whatever is necessary . You have to make a place for yourself here . "
18683	18686	18645	18645	He	57	“ Teray ... "
18687	18743	18645	18645	He	57	" I ca n't protect you . You . . . are n't my wife anymore . Perhaps you will be again . I 'll fight for that . If I break free , I wo n't leave you here . But for now . . . we both know what you have to do . ”
18744	18754	18642	18642	she	48	" I 'd like to help you kill him ! ”
18755	18805	18645	18645	He	57	“ You know better . You hate him for what he 's done to me ! You ca n't afford to do that . Think of yourself . You 're beautiful , and strong enough to rise high in any House . Please him , Iray . Please him ! ”
19904	19913	19914	19914	Teray	57	" It will be tender for a while , ”
19918	19935	19936	19937	The mute	1139	“ But it 's all right . Have a good breakfast and take the day off . ”
19940	19944	19936	19937	The mute	1139	“ Thank you . ”
20416	20464	20400	20400	She	477	" What the hell is wrong with you , letting this sort of thing go on ! I thought you were a little better than Jackman -or at least stronger . I thought I 'd repaired this poor girl for the last time when you took over . ”
20465	20469	20471	20471	Teray	57	" Hold on , "
20480	20504	20471	20471	Teray	57	“ I do n't know what you 're talking about . Why do n't you take care of Suliana , then tell me ? ”
20505	20511	20400	20400	She	477	" You do n't know ! "
20517	20548	20549	20549	She	477	" No , I do n't . Now let 's wait until you 've finished before we argue about whether or not I should . Take care of the mute . "
20750	20753	20745	20745	Suliana	73	“ Again ? ”
20881	20888	20890	20890	Amber	74	" Did you get it all ? "
20904	20915	20895	20895	she	74	" I got what that kitchen mute knew , anyway . "
20916	20926	20895	20895	she	74	“ And you did n't know anything about it ? ”
20927	20968	20895	20895	she	74	“ Not consciously . I see now that I have knowledge of it from Jackman , though . And I see that it 's been going on because Jackman was too frightened of Jason to go to Coransee about it . ”
20969	20979	20895	20895	she	74	“ Your name is Teray , is n't it ? ”
20980	20983	20895	20895	she	74	“ Yes . ”
20984	21001	20895	20895	she	74	“ Teray , what the goddamn hell have you been doing for the past few weeks ? ”
21011	21018	21019	21019	he	57	“ You 've made your point , ”
21023	21028	21019	21019	he	57	" Now drop it . ”
21029	21032	21033	21033	Her	530	" Why ? ”
21039	21068	21033	21033	Her	530	“ Are you ashamed ? Good . If you can feel ashamed , I guess there 's some hope for you . What are you going to do ? ”
21086	21127	21083	21083	someone	1154	" I 'll see that Jason never gets his 60 PATTERNMASTER hands on her again - or on any other mute . And I 'll warn Coransee in case Jason finds a Patternist woman weak enough for him to abuse . "
21128	21135	21136	21136	Teray	57	" All right . What else ? ”
21145	21203	21136	21136	Teray	57	" I 'm going to listen while you tell me about the other cases of this sort of thing that you 've had to treat . Then when I 've heard them all , I 'm going to take a chance and pass the word that anyone who abuses my mutes will have me to deal with . ”
21207	21253	21204	21204	Amber	74	“ That 's not taking a chance . That 's your job . The only reason Jackman did n't do it was because he did n't have the strength to enforce it - or , as you said , the courage to go to Coransee . ”
21254	21274	21275	21275	She	74	“ For me , it 's taking a chance . You 'll have to take my word for that . ”
21280	21345	21275	21275	She	74	“ In trouble with Coransee already , eh ? I see . Well , I ca n't help there , but if you find that you need help with any of the others , you can call on me . I know you 're strong , but you take away their fun , and they might not come at you one at a time . ”
21392	21409	21384	21384	He	57	“ Amber , why the hell have n't you gone out and started your own House ? ”
21410	21418	21419	21419	she	74	" I will , sooner or later , ”
21422	21433	21419	21419	she	74	“ I just let Coransee sidetrack me for a while . ”
21457	21463	21451	21451	she	74	“ Are you an apprentice ? "
21464	21467	21451	21451	she	74	" No . "
21468	21488	21451	21451	she	74	“ But you sounded serious - as though you intend to just walk away from Coransee 's House someday . ”
21489	21494	21495	21495	PATTERNMASTER	74	" I walked in . ”
21497	21500	21451	21451	she	74	" Voluntarily ? "
21501	21577	21578	21578	He	532	“ Yes . He did n't have a healer and I did n't have a place to stay while I healed myself of some serious wounds the Clayarks had given me . I had just come down from Karston Sector . Then Coransee and I realized how well we got along , and I 've been here ever since . But I 'm not one of his wives , Teray , I 'm an independent . ”
21618	21637	21578	21578	He	532	" I did n't know there were any more independents . As bad as the Clayarks are now ... "
21639	21665	21578	21578	He	532	“ We 're still around . We just stay in one place longer than we used to . We 're still free people , though . ”
21666	21680	21578	21578	He	532	“ I hope I 'm around the day you try to leave Coransee . ”
21681	21705	21706	21706	Teray	57	" You probably will be . That time 's coming fast . You know , we 're supposed to be talking about mutes . ”
21713	21729	21706	21706	Teray	57	“ All right . Tell what you know about mute abuse here in the House . "
21762	21765	21767	21767	Amber	74	“ Open , ”
21769	21780	21767	21767	Amber	74	“ I 'll give it to you all at once . "
22091	22105	22088	22088	his	57	“ Amber , has this been going on while I 've been here ? ”
22106	22163	22258	22258	PATTERNMASTER	74	" Not much of it . People know you 're strong , and they 're cautious . And too , most people repair the damage after they 've done it - or they call me . But Jason had apparently decided that you 're not going to be any more of a problem than Jackman was . ”
22164	22184	22185	22185	Amber	74	“ How can Coransee let all this go on ? He must know about some of it at least . ”
22189	22243	22185	22185	Amber	74	" He knows . I 've told him often enough myself . He wo n't let me do anything about it unless I give up my independence and settle here . I do n't think he 'll stop me , though , if all I do is help his muteherd avoid getting killed . ”
22244	22257	22258	22258	PATTERNMASTER	74	“ But does n't he care that his mutes are being tortured ? ”
22260	22288	22258	22258	PATTERNMASTER	74	“ There 's only one thing he cares about right now . And even though I understand his problem , it 's driving me away from him . ”
22289	22296	22185	22185	Amber	74	“ What are you talking about ? "
22297	22307	22308	22308	She	558	" You ought to know better than I do . ”
22314	22356	22308	22308	She	558	" You 're his brother . Jackman told everybody that . Full brother . I would n't be surprised to find you just like him - sitting around waiting for Rayal to die so you can try to win the Pattern . ”
22365	22373	22374	22374	he	559	“ I 'm not after the Pattern , ”
22377	22402	22374	22374	he	559	“ As I told Coransee , I want my freedom and a chance to establish a House of my own . That 's all . ”
22416	22471	22403	22403	She	560	" I think you 're telling the truth . Which is surprising . Coransee wants the Pattern the way you and I want to go on breathing . It 's just about that basic . If somebody stopped me from healing , I might be the way he is now - climbing the walls . ”
22472	22482	22374	22374	he	559	“ He did n't seem that way to me . ”
22483	22540	22665	22665	PATTERNMASTER	59	“ He ca n't afford to seem that way . But if you were a healer , you 'd know . Or just if you 'd known him longer . He does things to people now , or lets things be done , that he would never have tolerated two years ago when I met him . ”
22541	22551	22403	22403	She	560	“ All because he wants the Pattern so badly . ”
22552	22652	22374	22374	he	559	“ More than wants - needs . Holding the Pattern is what he was born to do , and it needs doing . He was all right when Rayal was doing an adequate job of holding it . Now ... Rayal has all he can do to keep himself alive , and it might be better for the people if he did n't even do that . The people need a new Patternmaster , and believe me , it 's a need Coransee can feel . But he does n't dare do anything about it until Rayal lets go . ”
22653	22663	22665	22665	PATTERNMASTER	59	" You think you know a lot about it . ”
22666	22679	22403	22403	She	560	" I 'm a good healer . I ca n't help knowing . "
22680	22750	22751	22751	She	561	" If you 're right , it seems to me there 's not much more wrong with Coransee than there is with Jason and probably a lot of other people in this House . They 're confined here together with people they 're far from in the Pattern , and denied the right to do work that would have meaning to them --and denied a few other important things . ”
22754	22789	22751	22751	She	561	“ And you see what it 's doing to them , what it 's driving them to do . Think of the damage Coransee could do if he really gave way to his frustration . ”
22790	22807	22403	22403	She	560	“ Do n't think he is n't giving way to it just because you see him . ”
22808	22814	22815	22815	He	562	“ You 're still alive . "
22829	22879	22815	22815	He	562	“ All right . But if he can neglect his House the way he obviously has and allow the kind of perversion that goes on here , I 'm afraid to even think of what he 'll do if he takes on the larger responsibility of holding the Pattern . "
22880	22938	22815	22815	He	562	“ No need to be . Once he has the Pattern , once desire for it is n't eating him alive , then he 'll be able to settle down and attend to the details of protecting and leading the people . The way he protected and led his House before Rayal 's health got so bad . "
22939	22944	22945	22945	he	562	" You 're biased , ”
22948	22961	22962	22962	She	563	“ You care about him . You can make excuses for him . ”
22965	22978	22979	22979	She	563	“ Anything else I can tell you to help with your mutes ? ”
22986	23001	23002	23002	He	562	“ No . I guess I 'll get this one back to her room . "
23015	23021	23011	23011	he	562	“ Should n't she eat ? ”
23022	23041	23002	23002	He	562	“ When she wakes up . Why do n't you keep her here ? She 's well enough . ”
23042	23048	23049	23049	She	563	" Mind your own business . ”
23055	23072	23073	23073	She	563	“ Just keep her away from PATTERNMASTER 65 Jason . That will be plenty for me . "
23531	23547	23548	23548	he	75	" I thought I was going to have to carry you back to your room , ”
23552	23563	23548	23548	he	75	" I do n't have to go back to Jason ? ”
23571	23584	23564	23564	Her	73	“ You do n't have to go back to Jason . Ever . "
23585	23594	23564	23564	Her	73	“ I do n't belong to him anymore ? ”
23595	23600	23601	23601	She	73	“ That 's right . ”
23604	23610	23601	23601	She	73	“ Jackman said that once . "
23611	23640	23641	23641	She	73	" I 'm not Jackman . And after the . . . discussion I just had with Jason , I do n't think he 'll bother you again . ”
23738	23750	23752	23752	Suliana	73	" If I do n't have to go back to Jason , ”
23754	23762	23752	23752	Suliana	73	“ why ca n't I stay here ? ”
23812	23821	23822	23822	he	57	“ You can stay if you want to , ”
23945	23951	23952	23952	she	74	“ Just what you need , ”
23956	23965	23952	23952	she	74	“ I thought you might take my advice . "
23966	23979	23981	23981	Teray	57	" I wish you 'd take mine and mind your own business , "
23983	23994	23981	23981	Teray	57	" I am . I 'm a healer , remember ? ”
23995	24002	24003	24003	She	74	" I do n't need healing . "
24015	24021	24022	24022	she	74	“ I hardly know you , ”
24025	24039	24022	24022	she	74	“ But as you damned well know , we 're like this in the Pattern”-she
24045	24060	24022	24022	she	74	shake—“so when you lie to me , do n't expect me to believe you . "
25307	25310	25300	25300	It	627	" Kill ? ”
25324	25333	25335	25335	Teray	57	“ Not unless you make me kill you , ”
25337	25341	25335	25335	Teray	57	“ Not kill ? ”
25353	25356	25342	25343	The Clayark	57	“ Why ? "
25357	25363	25365	25365	Teray	57	“ I do n't know , ”
25367	25372	25373	25373	Teray	57	“ Boy ? Schoolboy ? ”
25416	25419	25421	25421	Teray	57	“ Man , "
25423	25431	25421	25421	Teray	57	“ So do n't do anything foolish . ”
25432	25436	25373	25373	Teray	57	" You want ? ”
25437	25446	25447	25448	The creature	627	" Nothing . Only to hear you speak . ”
25452	25461	25447	25448	The creature	627	“ Your language . . . not much . ”
25462	25467	25373	25373	Teray	57	“ But you understand . ”
25468	25472	25373	25373	Teray	57	“ To live . ”
25473	25497	25498	25499	The Clayark	57	" If you want to live , you 'd better stop stealing in Redhill . The Masters here are already after your people . ”
25510	25528	25529	25529	He	57	“ Why do you raid us ? We would n't kill you if you left us alone . ”
25543	25546	25547	25548	the creature	627	“ Enemies , ”
25551	25555	25547	25548	the creature	627	“ Not people . ”
25556	25563	25547	25548	the creature	627	“ You know we 're people . ”
25564	25571	25572	25572	It	627	“ Enemies . Land . Food . ”
25606	25612	25614	25614	Teray	57	“ You had better go , ”
25616	25626	25614	25614	Teray	57	" Before another Patternist finds you and kills you . ”
25639	25642	25627	25628	The creature	627	“ Rayal ? ”
25656	25659	25653	25653	He	57	“ What ? ”
25660	25670	25671	25671	Teray	57	“ You . . . your father . Rayal ? ”
25681	25687	25690	25691	the creature	627	“ Go , I said . "
26105	26117	26118	26118	she	74	“ I think you may have come home just in time , ”
26121	26129	26118	26118	she	74	“ Why ? What 's going on ? ”
26130	26169	26170	26170	He	57	" Your friend Joachim . He 's brought one of Rayal 's journeymen here . I do n't think it was a very bright thing for him to do , but I think he did it for you . ”
26175	26182	26170	26170	He	57	“ Why would you think that ? ”
26183	26194	26118	26118	she	74	" You mean how do I know anything about it ? ”
26195	26198	26199	26199	She	74	" Yes ! ”
26202	26224	26199	26199	She	74	" Well , you might as well know . Remember that heart attack Coransee gave you on your first night here ? ”
26237	26253	26254	26254	she	74	" It 's so much easier to hurt or kill than it is to heal , ”
26257	26297	26254	26254	she	74	“ Especially to heal someone other than yourself . Coransee had to call me to save your life . I did n't ask any questions then , but I did later - after Suliana . And Coransee answered them . "
26397	26408	26409	26409	she	74	“ I did n't ask him out of idle curiosity , ”
26435	26438	26439	26439	he	57	“ Listen , ”
26451	26462	26439	26439	he	57	“ Listen , do n't do that again . Ever . ”
26463	26467	26468	26468	she	74	“ All right , ”
26617	26620	26616	26616	his	57	“ no . ”
26653	26660	26661	26661	Coransee	51	“ This is Michael , Teray . "
26667	26677	26661	26661	Coransee	51	“ He 's a journeyman in Rayal 's House . "
26779	26782	26783	26783	Michael	44	“ Teray , ”
26787	26849	26783	26783	Michael	44	“ I have some questions to ask you . First , though , I want you to know what 's happened . Joachim , who was your Housemaster for a short period , has accused Coransee first of illegally forcing you into his House while you were still under the protection of the school - thus , of trading in schoolchildren . ”
26854	26880	26850	26850	Teray	57	" And second , of competing for the Pattern now , before the legal beginning of the competition - while Patternmaster Rayal is still alive . "
26881	26886	26888	26888	Teray	57	" It 's true , "
26890	26923	26888	26888	Teray	57	“ I was Joachim 's apprenticetechnically still in school . Coransee forced me into his House as an outsider so that he could keep me from competing with him for the Pattern . "
26924	26939	26850	26850	Teray	57	" Why do you say he forced you into his House for that reason ? ”
26940	26952	26888	26888	Teray	57	" He told me that 's why he was doing it . "
26960	26966	26967	26967	he	50	“ It 's clear then , "
26970	26981	26967	26967	he	50	“ Coransee was competing for the Pattern ahead of time . ”
26987	27007	26982	26982	Michael	44	“ I could look into the boy 's thoughts for verification , but I would rather not have to . ”
27013	27076	27008	27008	Coransee	51	“ If you expect me to confirm all that , you 're going to have to . It 's true up to a point , of course . I did take Teray from Joachim . And Joachim accepted payment for him . He accepted a very good young artist I had just acquired . I claim that to be a legal trade . ”
27079	27084	27086	27086	Joachim	50	“ Legal , hell ! ”
27088	27099	27086	27086	Joachim	50	“ There is no legal way to trade an apprentice . ”
27100	27114	27118	27118	Teray	57	“ Why did you trade him then - if he was an apprentice ? "
27141	27149	27151	27151	Joachim	50	" You forced me to trade him , ”
27153	27191	27151	27151	Joachim	50	" I 've told Journeyman Michael about the hold you have on me . It shames me , but it 's a fact . I wo n't sacrifice Teray 's freedom by pretending it does n't exist . "
27192	27214	27086	27086	Joachim	50	" You sacrificed Teray 's so - called freedom months ago , Joachim . You sacrificed it to your own greed . ”
27215	27233	27333	27333	Joachim	50	" I will open to Journeyman Michael to prove that you forced me to make that trade ! "
27234	27332	27333	27333	Joachim	50	“ Open . Journeyman Michael will see that I forced you to give up Teray - as I did . But I did absolutely nothing to force you to take payment for him . You could easily have given him up as I demanded , without taking payment , and then gone to Rayal to complain if you felt you had been forced to do something wrong . Instead , you made a profitable trade for a valuable artist . Now you come back trying to cheat me out of the price you paid for that artist . ”
27351	27374	27345	27345	He	50	“ You lying son of a bitch . You son of a whelping Clayark bit ... Coransee went on as though uninterrupted . “
27416	27427	27428	27428	Journeyman	1152	" Helplessly , almost pitifully , Joachim turned to Michael . “
27446	27465	27466	27466	Journeyman	1152	” Coransee looked at Joachim with something very like PATTERNMASTER 79 amusement . Then he looked at Michael . “
27486	27487	27483	27483	I	0	” “
27495	27504	27483	27483	I	0	” Michael glanced at Joachim . Coransee nodded . "
27539	27546	27535	27535	he	1475	” Now he looked at Joachim . “
27570	27582	27583	27583	God	68	" Joachim leaned back and rested his head against one hand . “
27591	27601	27585	27585	I	0	” Michael 's mouth was a straight thin line . “
27623	27632	27633	27633	You	50	” Joachim gave a wild kind of laugh . “
27649	27654	27640	27640	You	50	” Michael looked pained . “
27669	27670	27660	27661	an artist	211	” "
27702	27703	27698	27698	you	50	" "
27739	27740	27720	27720	you	50	” “
27743	27747	27720	27720	you	50	” muttered Joachim . “
27759	28000	27720	27720	you	50	" He glanced covertly at Teray . Teray realized at once that now was the time he could have revenge on Joachim if he wanted it . His own memories acknowledged as an apprentice . Whether Joachim and Coransee opened or not , Teray 's memories would be enough . He could cause Joachim to lose his House . Not 80 PATTERNMASTER only that , but such an act might win Teray 's freedom . Joachim would lose his House , Teray might go free , and Coransee ... ? Certainly Coransee deserved far more than Joachim to lose his House . He might actually lose it for the less - than - one - year period that Rayal had left to live . Of course , within that period Teray would have the freedom to learn . He would be able to travel safely to Forsyth and study at Rayal 's House . But for that possible freedom he would have to sacrifice Joachim . There was no way around that . And somehow , in spite of his severely lowered opinion of Joachim , he could not quite bring himself to destroy the man . He realized that Michael and Coransee as well as Joachim were looking at him as though awaiting his decision . He met their eyes for a moment , then went to a chair at one side of Coransee 's desk and sat down . “
28007	28062	28098	28098	You	0	” he said disgustedly . Joachim seemed to sag , eyes closed in relief . Michael was impassive , and Coransee seemed almost bored . He toyed listlessly with a smooth cube of stone - probably a blank stone with nothing yet recorded into it . Perhaps he was even recording into it now . "
28067	28072	28098	28098	You	0	” said Michael wearily . “
28083	28084	28085	28085	I	0	" "
28089	28097	28098	28098	You	0	” said Coransee simply . Michael frowned . “
28120	28121	28101	28101	you	0	” "
28124	28166	28167	28167	Teray	57	" Teray sat up very straight , wanting to dispute , wanting to damn Coransee for the liar he was , but Joachim 's fate had made him cautious . He waited to see how Michael would handle it . PATTERNMASTER 81 “
28169	28174	28175	28175	you	57	" the journeyman said , "
28188	28189	28192	28192	Journeyman	1152	” “
28194	28195	28192	28192	Journeyman	1152	" “
28205	28206	28199	28199	he	51	” “
28228	28232	28222	28222	I	0	” Teray squarely . “
28239	28240	28234	28234	you	57	" "
28257	28269	28247	28247	He	51	” Immediately Teray wished he had left off the last sentence . “
28276	28292	28274	28274	Teray	57	" It was Coransee who asked the question . Michael looked at him in surprise . “
28304	28305	28299	28299	you	57	” “
28343	28374	28375	28375	Teray	57	” There was no point in telling anything but the truth . It was in his memory - and he was not as good at twisting it as Coransee was . “
28377	28378	28375	28375	Teray	57	" "
28392	28393	28379	28379	You	0	” “
28416	28493	28379	28379	You	0	" Teray fumed silently , seeing the look of defeat come to Michael 's face . The second charge had died even more quickly than the first . Teray let his mind go back over that morning , that breakfast with Coransee , trying to find some truth he could tell or twist . There was nothing . He himself could think of arguments to kill any arguments he might make . Teray glanced at Joachim . “
28498	28505	28506	28506	He	59	” he said quietly . 82 PATTERNMASTER "
28514	28518	28506	28506	He	59	” said Joachim . “
28523	28535	28506	28506	He	59	" Michael shifted in his chair , and said to Coransee , “
28573	28574	28575	28575	He	57	” "
28578	28579	28575	28575	He	57	” “
28582	28583	28575	28575	He	57	" “
28628	28629	28630	28630	I	0	” "
28633	28647	28630	28630	I	0	” Michael lowered his head for a moment , then looked at Teray . "
28682	28683	28669	28669	you	57	” "
28696	28700	28687	28687	he	57	" said Teray . "
28712	28785	28786	28786	Journeyman	44	" That was reckless . Teray wondered why he was bothering to talk recklessly while he was still in Coransee 's House . Maybe the Housemaster 's lies had angered him more than they should have . After all , lies were what he should have expected from Coransee in such a situation . But Coransee had prepared for his lies long before he had to tell them . Coransee spoke quietly : “
28805	28839	28796	28796	I	0	" And that simply , it was over . Teray and Joachim were dismissed so that Michael and Coransee could discuss moreimportant matters . In the common room , Joachim said to Teray , “
28847	28853	28796	28796	I	0	" Teray shrugged . PATTERNMASTER 83 “
28865	28869	28862	28862	Michael	44	" Joachim continued . “
28887	28888	28880	28880	Coransee	51	” "
28894	28901	28880	28880	Coransee	51	" Joachim looked at him strangely . "
28912	28961	28902	28902	I	0	” Teray said nothing , his face carefully expressionless . He did not want to lie to Joachim but he could not confide in him . Joachim was Coransee 's man , whether he liked it or not . Joachim must have understood . He changed the subject : “
28974	28975	28964	28964	Coransee	51	” “
28979	28980	28964	28964	Coransee	51	" “
28983	28997	28998	28998	He	51	” Joachim only breathed the word . He looked around the huge room . “
29007	29008	29011	29011	he	51	” "
29014	29015	29011	29011	he	51	” "
29022	29023	29024	29024	I	0	" “
29030	29031	29032	29032	Teray	57	" “
29072	29096	29097	29097	Joachim	50	" Teray ignored him , and looked around the room to see whether Amber was still there . She had gone . Good . “
29107	29108	29109	29109	Teray	57	” “
29166	29179	29180	29180	I	0	” Teray shook his head slowly , eyes closed for a moment . "
29230	29231	29226	29226	you	50	” "
29257	29261	29250	29250	you	50	” Teray frowned . “
29279	29280	29281	29281	She	74	” “
29326	29327	29320	29320	her	74	” "
29331	29335	29320	29320	her	74	” muttered Teray . “
29354	29361	29342	29342	she	74	" Joachim shook his head slowly . “
29395	29733	29383	29383	She	74	” Silently , Teray hoped he was right . It would be too easy for the woman to pick up something . No matter what happened , he was going to have to leave soon . He found himself wishing he could speak privately to Michael , but he knew it would do no good . Even if the journeyman sympathized with him , the law really was on Coransee 's side . Michael could not change that . Journeyman Michael stayed two days more , then headed farther north on more of Rayal 's business . North . Forsyth was 480 kilometers south . Teray could not even hope to catch up with Michael and try to attach himself to the journeyman 's party . That might not have been a good idea anyway , though , since it would have meant asking Michael to risk his own life by defying Coransee . After all , if things went as Coransee expected , Michael would soon be under Coransee 's direct control . PATTERNMASTER 85 Teray would have to go alone . He realized that he was putting off leaving for just that reason - because the journey looked more and more like suicide to him . And what should he do about Iray ? That was something he did not want to think about . He was afraid to talk to Iray - afraid she might not want to leave Coransee , afraid her apparent interest in Coransee might be real . But even if it was not - she had kept her word , after all , she had not changed her name - how could he ask her to risk herself with him again ? How could he take her out and perhaps get her killed ? Then , strangely , it was Amber who gave him hope . She was waiting for him in his room the night after Michael left . He walked in and found her staring out his window . "
29736	29746	29747	29747	I	0	” she said as she turned and saw him . "
29755	29756	29747	29747	I	0	" “
29769	29770	29757	29757	You	720	” "
29782	29789	29780	29780	Michael	44	” And suddenly he was listening . “
29800	29801	29792	29792	Michael	44	” "
29832	29833	29821	29821	He	44	” “
29837	29838	29821	29821	He	44	” “
29869	29885	29857	29857	Coransee	51	” Teray went to his bed , sat down , and took off his shoes . "
29902	29903	29898	29898	I	0	" “
29934	29994	29931	29931	You	720	" Teray shuddered . He had n't known . He had n't even PATTERNMASTER thought about such a possibility . It was true enough , though , that personal attention from Michael could lead to personal attention from Rayal . And surely Coransee would not want Rayal to have the chance to pay attention to another potentially powerful son . “
30000	30005	29931	29931	You	720	” he asked Amber . “
30023	30099	29931	29931	You	720	” In the moment of utter surprise that followed her words , he did the thing he had feared he might do : He betrayed himself to her . His screen slipped - not far , and only for an instant . Coransee would have been hard put to read anything in so short a time . But Amber , it seemed , knew how to use her closeness to him . She read everything . "
30102	30108	29931	29931	You	720	” she smiled at him , “
30133	30160	30172	30175	a few good fighters	722	” Teray dropped all pretense . Now , either she would report him or she would not . And Michael had seen fit to trust her . “
30166	30170	30172	30175	a few good fighters	722	” he said , “
30192	30193	30184	30185	twelve women	723	” "
30196	30200	30184	30185	twelve women	723	” she corrected . “
30206	30207	30202	30202	you	0	" "
30219	30273	30217	30217	me	0	” He broke off and looked at Amber . She was still barely an acquaintance . Someone to sleep with , perhaps , but not someone to talk over his personal problems with . But on the other hand , why not ? It was so easy . And who else was there ? “
30286	30287	30279	30279	I	0	" "
30314	30315	30308	30308	you	0	” “

30346	30351	30337	30337	I	0	” PATTERNMASTER Amber shrugged . “

30381	30382	30369	30369	I	0	" "

30410	30416	30401	30401	you	0	” She smiled a little . “

30429	30430	30427	30427	Coransee	51	” “
30433	30440	30427	30427	Coransee	51	” She took a deep breath . “
30445	30449	30427	30427	Coransee	51	" she said . “
30452	30453	30454	30454	You	0	" “

30569	30584	30559	30559	We	730	” He took several seconds to digest this . His main emotion was relief . “

30638	30650	30635	30635	Teray	57	“ I wish you were just a little harder to accept . ”
30651	30675	30635	30635	Teray	57	" I 'll wish that myself when the time comes for me to leave you . But I do n't wish it now . ”
30676	30683	30635	30635	Teray	57	“ You 're staying the night . "
30684	30689	30691	30691	PATTERNMASTER	57	“ What about Suliana ? ”
30692	30713	30635	30635	Teray	57	" I just reached her . She 's going to sleep in her old roomor wherever else she wants to . ”
30714	30721	30722	30722	She	731	" I 'm staying , then . ”
30856	30864	30865	30865	he	57	“ I have to talk to you , "
30961	30966	30968	30968	Teray	57	" I 'm sorry , ”
30970	30997	30968	30968	Teray	57	“ but I have to ask you . ... Is there any way . . . through you , that Coransee will hear what I say ? "
30998	31001	31002	31002	she	320	" No , "
31006	31034	31002	31002	she	320	" I 'm linked with him , but only so he can be sure that you and I . . . that we do n't make love . "
31035	31045	30968	30968	Teray	57	“ The link is just an alarm , then ? ”
31051	31067	31048	31048	She	320	“ And I wo n't tell him anything you do n't want him to know . ”
31116	31123	31124	31124	he	57	“ Will you open to me ? ”
31127	31134	31135	31135	she	320	“ You do n't trust me , "
31148	31165	31135	31135	she	320	“ I trust you ... trust who you were . I want to trust you now . ”
31166	31185	31145	31145	her	320	“ You can . I wo n't open to you , but I wo n't betray you either . ”
31186	31205	31145	31145	her	320	" Has he hurt you ? Has he done something you do n't want me to ... ? ! “
31216	31217	31212	31212	he	744	" “
31223	31224	31225	31225	I	0	" “
31230	31253	31227	31227	your	57	” There it was . All his fears wrapped in four words . He could not pretend to misunderstand her any longer . “
31261	31265	31254	31254	I	0	” she said . “
31273	31282	31227	31227	your	57	" She faced him , finally , wearily . “
31296	31308	31309	31309	He	744	” Teray said nothing , could think of nothing to say . “
31316	31320	31313	31313	I	0	” she said . “
31335	31336	31337	31337	Iray	48	" "
31339	31403	31404	31404	Iray	48	" He could not sit still and listen to another woman inventing good qualities for Coransee . Especially not Iray . She looked at him solemnly , her shielded mind not quite hiding the fact that she did not want to be there with him . She had stilled her twisting hands , but her very stillness bespoke tension , withdrawal . PATTERNMASTER 91 "
31431	31432	31422	31422	you	48	” "
31436	31437	31422	31422	you	48	” “
31440	31526	31422	31422	you	48	” He had to trust her . How could he expect her to believe him if he did not tell her what there was to believe ? He had failed her once . Twice . She had reason to be hesitant . He outlined his plan quickly , giving her the assurance that Michael had passed on to him through Amber without mentioning Amber herself . Now was not the time to cloud things further . Iray took a deep breath and shook her head . “
31529	31533	31422	31422	you	48	” she said . “
31546	31547	31422	31422	you	48	” “
31552	31556	31422	31422	you	48	” he said . “

31570	31606	31422	31422	you	48	" He was silent for a long moment . He could look at her and see that she meant it . Instead , he looked at the ground , at a wall of the House . “
31675	31676	31662	31662	I	0	” "
31699	31709	31695	31695	I	0	” He said nothing , only stared at her . “

31847	31988	31989	31989	Teray	57	" There was nothing he could say to her that would not twist back and indict him , too . Even his anger was more at his own helplessness , and at Coransee , than at her . He had thought of her with Coransee , even thought of her coming to prefer Coransee . But he had never really believed she would . In spite of all Coransee 's power and apparent attractiveness to women , he had never let himself believe it . She touched his arm and he savored her touch for a moment , then moved his arm away . She was still shielding him out and her touch brought her no closer to him . He could have taken more pleasure in Suliana 's touch - the touch of a mute . Or Amber 's . “
31991	31996	31997	31997	I	0	” she said softly , “
32003	32014	31997	31997	I	0	” She broke off suddenly as he looked at her . "
32019	32023	32015	32015	I	0	” she said . “
32038	32051	32034	32034	I	0	" He stood up and started toward the common - room door . "
32054	32094	32034	32034	I	0	” She caught his arm again , this time in a grip that he would have had to hurt her to loosen . He stood still , looking down at her , waiting for her to let him go . “
32152	32325	32143	32143	I	0	” After a moment he nodded and she let him go . But he stayed where he was , watching her , not wanting her to see the pain in his eyes but not able to turn away again . He raised his hand to her face . She drew back from him sharply , then turned away and hurried past him into the House . Teray stood still for several seconds longer . Finally he shook his head . He reached out to one of his kitchen mutes . PATTERNMASTER 93 The man whose foot he had healed . Silently , with careful stable mute - a mute who was not one of his charges , but who , of course , was obliged to obey any Patternist . He gave orders to the stable mute , then went back up to his room . Amber was dressed and having breakfast . Teray realized that he had eaten nothing , and at the same time realized that he had no appetite . “
32339	32344	32335	32335	your	753	” he told her . “
32362	32371	32350	32350	I	0	” She looked surprised , but nodded slowly . "
32375	32376	32350	32350	I	0	” “
32408	32409	32410	32410	I	0	" "
32413	32414	32410	32410	I	0	" "
32439	32768	32769	32769	I	0	" She said nothing to that . She went on eating . They traveled southwest toward the coast and toward the nearest borders of the sector . Teray had decided to take the coast trail south , if he could . The inland route was easier , less likely to be washed out or blocked , but it was also the most - often - traveled route . It was where Patternist caravans passed and where Clayarks lay in wait for them . The inland route was a little shorter , too , because it did not follow the eccentricities of the coast . But it did go straight through the middle of twenty - one Patternist sectors . The little - traveled coast route went through three . There were some Clayarks along the coast route . But then there were Clayarks everywhere , breeding like rabbits , warring among themselves , and attacking Patternists . Teray 94 PATTERNMASTER hoped to find them only in small family groups along the coast . Michael , he recalled , had traveled part of his way north along the coast route . Teray had asked a pair of his outsiders about their trip , prying as casually as he could . With his large party , Michael had had little trouble , but he had sensed at least one large tribe . He had gone into a Patternist sector to escape it . And that was something Teray could not do . He had a better chance against the Clayarks than he would have against a group of his own people who decided to earn Coransee 's gratitude by capturing him . Until he reached Rayal 's House , the only Patternist he could trust was Amber . She rode along beside him , strangely accepting of his surly mood . But then , she knew the reason for it . He wished she did n't . She said quietly , “
32777	32778	32775	32775	Teray	57	” “
32781	32782	32775	32775	Teray	57	” “
32854	32855	33150	33150	Amber	74	" “
32859	33149	33150	33150	Amber	74	” he muttered . She said nothing else . They rode for several minutes in silence . Finally , without speaking , he opened , reached out to her . Linking was like clasping hands — and did not require even that much effort . Now her alarm , her fear , almost any strong emotion of hers , would alert him . And his emotions would alert her . But beyond that , as he had feared , he was too much aware of the link - aware of a strong , ongoing sense of oneness with her . Normally , a link , once established , became part of the mental background , not to be noticed again until one of the PATTERNMASTER 95 linked people did whatever the link was sensitized to respond to . But any kind of contact with Amber had to be different , had to be too close . There was nothing for him to do but accept it -- and surprisingly , it was not that hard to accept . He felt himself relaxing almost against his will . Felt the anger and the hurt that Iray had caused him ebbing , not vanishing completely but retreating , shrinking so that it no longer occupied his whole mind . And Amber was not doing it , was not reaching him through the link to offer unasked - for healing . It was her mental presence alone that he was responding to . Her presence was eclipsing emotion that he would normally have taken much longer to get over , and he was enjoying it . He should have felt resentful at even this small invasion . Instead he only felt curious . “
33152	33158	33150	33150	Amber	74	" She looked at him . “
33168	33172	33150	33150	Amber	74	” She grinned . “

33208	33233	33206	33206	you	74	” He considered that , and shrugged . He was too comfortable for her presumptions to bother him . He indulged his curiosity further . “
33258	33275	33249	33249	I	0	" There was something guarded , almost frightened , in the way she looked at him . “
33283	33303	33278	33278	you	74	” Her manner confused him . Apparently she had something to hide . But then , who did n't ? “
33328	33351	33319	33319	You	74	” She sighed , and then kept silent for so long that he 96 PATTERNMASTER thought she was not going to answer . "
33357	33362	33319	33319	You	74	” she said finally . “
33388	33389	33390	33390	Joachim	50	” “
33409	33415	33400	33400	he	1475	” She seemed to relax . “

33621	33628	33616	33616	he	77	" She gave a bitter laugh . "

33814	33822	33823	33823	She	78	” Teray turned to stare at her . "
33825	33826	33823	33823	She	78	" “
33843	33847	33837	33837	he	77	” said Amber . "

33870	33874	33876	33876	me	0	” Teray answered . “
33882	33898	33876	33876	me	0	” She stopped her horse , causing Teray to stop , then spoke very softly . "
33910	33914	33915	33915	Leal	77	” she said . “
33939	33957	33923	33923	I	0	” The link betrayed her hurt . She had taken Teray seriously and was waiting for rejection . “
33968	33997	33998	33998	she	74	” She looked at him mistrustfully , then read the message the link held for her - his lack of any emotion beyond surprise and curiosity . touchy , "
34001	34009	33998	33998	she	74	“ Leal taught me to be touchy . "
34010	34021	33923	33923	I	0	" Why did you tell me that part of it ? ”
34022	34066	34067	34067	Teray	57	" Because you would have found out anyway . Piece by piece . I would be thinking about it and off guard , and you would pick it up . We 're going to pay a price in mental privacy for our closeness . "
34070	34084	34067	34067	Teray	57	“ Well , Leal had reason to react with jealousy , but I ... "
34085	34120	33923	33923	I	0	" Jealousy , anger , humiliation . How dare I put him aside for a woman ? Poor teacher . He had trouble enough trying to compete with men for the women he wanted . "
34121	34144	34145	34146	98 PATTERNMASTER	778	“ I do n't see why . He was the Schoolmaster . He should have been able to attract plenty of women . "
34147	34240	33923	33923	I	0	“ Yes , but not the ones he wanted . He could attract women teachers , but he considered them beneath his notice . He could and did attract older girl students , but they always had to either leave him or become teachers . He had the idea that women from outside the school were better . He tried to attract them and usually failed . But until I met Kai , he had never lost one of his student girl friends to one of them . It was too much . "
34241	34250	33923	33923	I	0	“ And Kai even had her own House . "
34251	34329	33923	33923	I	0	“ Leal would n't have hated her for that if she had gone to him instead of to me . Prestige . But since she did n't , her House just became more fuel for his jealousy . He had always wanted a House of his own anyway , and he knew he 'd never have one . He was almost too strong to be a teacher , but not nearly strong enough to be a Housemaster . ”
34330	34340	34341	34341	Teray	57	" A stronger man would have reacted more reasonably . ”
34344	34354	34341	34341	Teray	57	“ After all , you 're not that unusual . "
34355	34363	34364	34364	He	57	“ Coransee did n't react too well . ”
34371	34401	34364	34364	He	57	“ What difference did it make to Coransee ? It happened before you met him , and it did n't keep you from staying for two years with him . ”
34402	34477	34341	34341	Teray	57	“ But it made a difference . I did n't tell him . He found out by snooping through my thoughts just a few weeks ago . That was when he decided that I was more of a challenge than he had thought . That was when he told me he intended to keep me in his House - deny my independence . Most people do n't try things like that with a healer . "
34478	34484	34341	34341	Teray	57	“ Could he have succeeded ? ”
34485	34514	34515	34515	Teray	57	“ Maybe , with his strength . Frankly , I 'm afraid of him . That 's why I 'd rather run away from him than fight him . ”
34521	34532	34517	34517	his	57	“ He has a habit of trying to domesticate people . ”
34533	34538	34341	34341	Teray	57	“ What about you ? ”
34539	34627	34341	34341	Teray	57	" I 'm still curious . I want to know how a pre - Pattern child PATTERNMASTER 99 managed not to be executed for killing a person as important as a Housemaster . I 'm surprised that his friends did n't before you gained your adult rights . And I 'm curious about you and Kai . But all of that is your business . I do n't want you to tell me because you 're afraid I 'll ferret it out anyway . I wo n't . ”
34628	34644	34517	34517	his	57	“ I do n't mind telling you , but that is n't what I meant . ”
34653	34713	34714	34714	She	781	“ Last night I asked you what you wanted between us , and you said ‘ something good . ' I think there was also the implication of ' something temporary . ' That 's all right for a start , but I might turn out to be as bad as Coransee . I might try for more too . ”
34723	34764	34717	34717	She	781	“ Do n't do it . One Coransee was enough . Now I 'll tell you the rest of my story . By the way , are you checking wide for Clayarks ? I 've seen them in these hills . ”
34765	34773	34774	34774	They	782	“ Checking as widely as I can . ”
34948	35029	34935	34935	he	77	“ Kai got me off , but she could n't get me all the way off . 100 PATTERNMASTER Instead of killing me , they exiled me from the sector . They meant for the Clayarks to do their killing for them . Kai was supposed to take me to the sector border and leave me there . Instead , she took me to her House . She induced transition - just a few days early , but early nevertheless . "
35038	35199	35200	35200	She	795	“ I swear I 'd rather let the Clayarks get me than go through anything like that again . I kept trying to just die and let it be over , and she kept bringing me back . Did I mention that she was a healer too ? Lucky thing . Although I did n't think so then . She dragged me through all of it - stripped away my childhood shield before I was ready to shed it . Left me mentally naked to absorb all the free - floating mental garbage within miles of me . I got other people 's agony , violent emotions , everything , until I could manage to form the voluntary shield that I was n't really ready to form yet . I almost killed her while she was trying to save me . I did n't know what I was doing . And I turned out to be stronger than she was . "
35308	35375	35376	35376	Amber	74	“ She made me eat and took away my weariness and healed the bruises and sprains I had gotten thrashing around during my transition . Then she gave me supplies , put me on a horse , and told me to run . I got out just ahead of the group of Housemasters that had finally - twelve hours too late - realized what was happening . ”
35412	35417	35419	35419	Teray	57	" She loved you , ”
35422	35436	35419	35419	Teray	57	" It was mutual . She almost lost her House because of me . ”
35437	35441	35495	35495	He	801	“ Only almost ? ”
35442	35494	35495	35495	He	801	“ She would have if it had n't been for Michael . That 's where I knew him from . She had called for help from Forsyth when I was first charged . Michael was in our area on other business but he had Clayark trouble on his way to us . "
35552	35553	35545	35545	he	801	" "

35620	35627	35613	35613	she	78	" Teray changed the subject abruptly . “
35636	35686	35688	35690	a small group	804	” He had n't had to say it . She was already looking off in the direction of the Clayarks . They were not visible , but there was definitely a group of them ahead , moving toward Teray and Amber . They were just beyond the next hill . "
35692	35696	35688	35690	a small group	804	” said Amber . “
35711	35712	35700	35700	They	804	” “
35738	35739	35743	35743	You	808	” "
35747	36171	35743	35743	You	808	" 102 PATTERNMASTER She opened to him as no one had since school , giving him access to and control over her mental strength . It was the way people who were close in the Pattern fought best . The way Joachim 's House fought , the way everyone fought in war when Rayal used the power that he held . But only Rayal could pull all the people together , funnel all their strength through his own mind , focus it on Clayarks anywhere from Forsyth itself to the northernmost Patternist sector . Lesser people grouped when they could with whomever they could - with whomever they trusted not to try to make the control permanent . Inexpertly , Teray channeled Amber 's strength into his own . Then , almost doubly powerful , he reached out to the Clayarks . The new strength was exhilarating , intoxicating . He almost had to hold himself back as he reached the Clayarks . Within one of them he located a large artery that led directly from the heart . He memorized its position so that he could find it quickly in the other Clayarks , then he ruptured the artery . The Clayark stumbled to the ground , clawing its chest . Instantly the other Clayarks fled , scattering in all directions , but Amber , otherwise inactive , kept track of them , focusing and refocusing Teray on them until all were dead or dying . Several minutes later they began riding past bodies . Amber was closed again - as closed as she could be while they were linked — and Teray had returned to her control over her mental strength . That strength was temporarily lessened , of course , as was Teray 's , but the lessening was slight . One of the dangers of lending mental strength to another person was that the other person might use too much of it , might drain the lender to exhaustion and death . But neither Teray nor Amber was anywhere near death . PATTERNMASTER 103 Teray stared at the bodies sprawled over the hillside , saw the expressions of agony on many of the Clayark faces , and did not know whether to feel sick or triumphant . Not one Clayark had had time to fire a shot or even get a look at the enemy who killed him . Still , Clayarks too were known to do their killing from hiding . It was strange fighting , repelling somehow . "
36182	36186	36180	36180	you	809	” asked Amber . "
36189	36255	36180	36180	you	809	" Teray rode past a Clayark female , dead , with arms herself . A relative perhaps . A daughter ? Clayarks kept their children with them to be raised by the natural parents . Teray looked away from the pair , frowning . They were Clayarks . They would have killed him if they could have . They were carriers of the Clayark disease . “
36272	36282	36265	36265	you	0	” He turned to look at Amber almost angrily . "

And with his mind , he could not help but be aware of her absolute belief in what she was saying . In spite of her manner , she was not boasting . She was afraid . Afraid for him . He felt the anger drain out of him to be replaced by something else . Something he could not quite name but that was far less comfortable than even the anger had been . "

37062	37078	37053	37053	You	57	” He sighed , and gave up without quite realizing that he was giving up . "
37084	37088	37053	37053	You	57	” she said . “
37101	37121	37092	37092	me	0	” He obeyed , watching her with the same mistrust that she had shown for him earlier . CHAPTER SIX "
37125	37130	37092	37092	me	0	” Amber was explaining , "
37207	37369	37370	37370	I	0	” Teray only half listened . His ears were full of the unfamiliar sound of the surf . He had spent all his life no more than a day 's ride from the beach , yet he had never seen the ocean through his own eyes . He had seen it through the eyes of others in the learning stones he had studied , but that was not the same . Now , as he and Amber rode down toward the oceanside trail , he gazed out , fascinated , at the seemingly endless water . He could see tiny rocky islands off shore . Nearer , the waves broke against sand and rocks with a noisy vigor that sometimes drowned out what Amber was saying . But that she had already given him mentally . Mental communication detracted from their awareness of the land - and possibly the Clayarks - around them . Thus she was repeating , summarizing aloud . "
37375	37382	37370	37370	I	0	” he told her . 108 PATTERNMASTER “
37390	37391	37370	37370	I	0	” “
37399	37716	37370	37370	I	0	” But he was not eager to try her method of killing , or any method of killing , again soon . In his mind 's eye , he could still see the Clayarks he had already killed . Maybe it would be easier if they were not human - headed or if he had not had a conversation with one . But she was right . He would not only have to get used to killing them , but he would have to kill more efficiently , in the way that she had shown him , if the two of them were to survive . He recalled the memory that she had given him of herself on foot , alone , running for the safety of Redhill two years before . She had been wounded but she had kept going . Her healer 's skill had kept her alive and conscious . And she was still killing , limiting the area of her perception to a long narrow wedge , sweeping that wedge around her like the hand of a clock . The Clayarks she touched in the deadly sweep convulsed and died . By the time they were dead , she had swept over six or seven more . They had managed to shoot her by firing from beyond the range of her sweep . But such long - range shooting required marksmanship that not all of them - not enough of them - possessed . Her sweeps turned the Clayarks ' own brains against them . She used their own energy to stimulate sudden , massive disruptions of their neural activities . The breathing centers in their brains were paralyzed . Their hearts ceased to beat and their blood circulation stopped . They died , almost literally , as though they had been struck by lightning . Or as though ... Teray frowned . “
37720	37727	37728	37728	your	827	” he said after a while , "
37746	37747	37740	37740	we	828	" “
37755	37759	37760	37760	You	827	” she said . "

37865	37875	37854	37854	they	830	” She frowned , and thought for a moment . "
37935	37936	37926	37926	we	828	” “

38101	38114	38069	38069	you	57	" Teray frowned , not understanding but not wanting to question further . “
38119	38123	38069	38069	you	57	” she said . “
38126	38127	38069	38069	you	57	" “

38250	38765	38240	38240	I	0	” It was the disease again , blocking the way . A disease that protected its carriers and killed their enemies . The disease of Clay 's Ark , brought back hundreds of years before , so the old records said , by the only starship ever to leave Earth and then return . A starship . A mute contrivance that had supposedly ended the reign of the mutes over the Earth they had sought to leave . That part of history had always held a grim fascination for Teray . His own race had been small then , scattered , disunited , a mere offshoot of the mutes . His people had been carefully bred for mental strength - bred by one of their own kind who happened to have been born with as much mental strength as he needed . One whose specialty had not been healing , teaching , creating art , or any of the ordinary talents . The Founder 's specialty had been living . He had lived for thousands of years , breeding , building the people who were to become Patternists . Finally , he had been killed by one of his own daughters - she who first created and held a Pattern . And meanwhile , mutes had been building a society more intricate , more mechanized , than anything that had existed since their downfall . Some Patternists refused to believe this segment of history . They said it was like believing that horses and cattle once had mechanized societies . But in Coransee 's House , Teray had seen for himself that mutes were more mechanically inclined than most Patternists . And PATTERNMASTER 111 mutes were intelligent . So much so that Teray would have enjoyed challenging them - letting them have more freedom , encouraging them to use their minds and their hands for more than drudgery . Then he could find out for himself whether the inventive ability that had once made them great still existed . After all , even now it was the mutes who handled what little machinery there was in Patternist Territory . And the Clayarks , who were only physically mutated mutes , were said to use simple machinery in their settlements beyond the eastern mountains . On the western side of the mountains , however , Clayarks produced nothing but weapons and warriors . At least , that was all Patternists had ever known them to produce . Yet Teray found himself thinking about the Clayark he had talked to . The creature had known Teray 's language , at least enough to communicate . But Teray , like most Patternists , knew nothing of the language the Clayarks spoke among themselves . Patternists almost never let Clayarks get close enough to them to hear them talk . Patternists and Clayarks stared at each other across a gulf of disease and physical difference and comfortably told themselves the same lie about each other . The lie that Teray 's Clayark had tried to get away with : “
38769	39089	38766	38767	Not people	1623	” That night another group of Clayarks drifted near them . Teray and Amber were camped on the beach , back against a hill . Amber had checked the horses over very carefully in what was to become a nightly ritual . She healed any injuries she found before they became serious , seeing to it , as she said , that they did not wind up on foot , and Clayark bait . They saved their rations and ate quail that Teray had mentally lured from one of the canyons in the hills . The Clayarks came into range behind them while they were eating . Amber , aware of the danger the moment Teray sensed it , 112 PATTERNMASTER opened to offer him her strength . He accepted it , and used it to extend his range . At once , he could sense the entire group of Clayarks walking toward them , moving through the hills rather than along the trail . Very shortly , those in the lead would see the two Patternists ' fire . Swiftly Teray reviewed the technique he had learned from Amber , then he swept over them like an ocean wave . A wave of destructive power , killing . group was slightly larger than the one they had met earlier . But Teray handled it in a fraction of the time he had needed to handle the first group . He handled it using less energy , since he was not required to puncture or tear anything . And since he handled it so quickly , he did not need Amber to spot potential escapees for him . There were no potential escapees . Since he would never see them physically , he swept over them once more to see that they all were dead . There was no movement at all . He turned to look at Amber . “
39092	39097	39098	39098	I	0	” She nodded gravely . “
39103	39104	39098	39098	I	0	” "

39226	39242	39206	39206	I	0	" He looked at her , shook his head , and smiled slightly . PATTERNMASTER 113 “
39254	39258	39244	39244	anyone	1502	" she asked . “
39281	39282	39268	39268	I	0	” “
39291	39292	39268	39268	I	0	” "
39350	39354	39344	39344	I	0	” She nodded . “
39399	39400	39394	39394	you	0	” "
39404	39449	39394	39394	you	0	” He hoped she was right . It would be reassuring to be able to do something better than Coransee could . Travel grew more difficult the next day . They reached the higher mountains and found that the trail lost itself among them , “
39456	40084	39394	39394	you	0	” Amber said . The sectors nearest the coast were supposed to keep it clear , but during Rayal 's long illness such work had become too dangerous . Teray and Amber walked and led their horses more than they rode . On the third day they did no riding at all . There was no longer a beach . The waves broke against rocks and the rocky base of the mountains . They knew the canyons and highlands that they had to travel . These they had memorized . There was no chance of their getting lost . But they were losing time . Walking , scrambling over rock and brush , wondering themselves where they and the horses were finding footholds . The trek was physically wearing , but at least they encountered few Clayarks . There were deer and quail for hunting , and there were 114 PATTERNMASTER cattle that they left alone . The cattle belonged to coastal sectors whose attention they did not want to attract . On the fourth day they traveled within the boundaries of one of these sectors . They passed through as quickly and carefully as they could . They were farther inland than they wanted to be . At one point they found themselves looking down on a large House comfortably surrounded by its outbuildings , which lay below them in a small valley . They hurried on . It was while they were passing through this sector that they became aware of a great tribe of Clayarks . They were well out of sight of the House , riding easily now since the people of the sector took care of their part of the trail . But they did n't take care of themselves very well if they let themselves be invaded by so many Clayarks . The Clayarks were resting - or at least they were not moving . Teray and Amber , their strength united , tried to find out how large the tribe was . They could find no end to it . It extended beyond their doubled range . Hundreds and hundreds of Clayarks ; surely death to any but a large , strong party of Patternists . Teray and Amber detoured widely to avoid any possible contact with them . The Clayarks seemed not to notice , but neither Teray nor Amber could relax again for some hours . Midway through the journey - on the ninth day rather than on the fifth , as it should have been — they had to leave the trail entirely even though it was well kept and smooth now . Here , it left the coast and ran through the middle of a large sector . It had only gone through an edge of the sector in which they had found the Clayarks . Now , though , the coast jutted out in a large peninsula while the trail continued on due south . Teray and Amber decided to lose a little more time and stay near the coast . They would not follow it as closely as they had , but they would stay well away from the Houses of the sector . As careful as they were , though , PATTERNMASTER early the next day they suddenly became aware of Patternists approaching them on horseback . Seven Patternists . By now Teray and Amber worked together almost instinctively , worked together as though they had been a team for months instead of days . And they both were strong . It was possible that together they could take on seven Patternists and have a chance of winning - if none of those Patternists was Coransee . Amber spoke as though on cue . "
40121	40122	40115	40115	he	51	” “
40130	40134	40123	40126	People from this sector	859	” said Teray . “
40146	40204	40123	40126	People from this sector	859	” The two groups met in a grove of trees , Teray and Amber on one side , and the seven strangers - four men and three women - on the other . Teray and Amber sat still , tense , shielded from the strangers , joined to each other only by the link . They waited . "
40212	40228	40123	40126	People from this sector	859	" said a small , white - haired woman in the center of the seven , "
40237	40353	40230	40230	you	861	” The woman 's hair was naturally white , not grayed with age , yet Teray knew she was old . He could not have explained how he knew . Her age did not show in any definable way . Either she or her healer had stopped all physical signs of its progress , to leave her looking about thirty - five . Yet Teray had no doubt that the woman had lived more than twice her apparent thirty - five years . Which was unusual for a Housemaster - as this woman seemed by her manner to be . Most Housemasters were killed for their Houses long before they reached this woman 's age . “
40360	40366	40356	40358	seventeen of us	862	" the woman said quietly . “
40394	40454	40389	40389	you	864	” 116 PATTERNMASTER Immediately Teray and Amber became aware of the ten others approaching from the opposite direction , only now coming within range of the quick scan that they dared to make . Teray looked at Amber . Amber shrugged , then relaxed into a posture of apparent submission . What could they do against seventeen linked Patternists ? “
40462	40469	40457	40457	you	864	” asked Teray . Teray frowned . “
40475	40476	40457	40457	you	864	" “
40491	40492	40493	40493	You	864	" “
40501	40502	40493	40493	You	864	" “
40505	40550	40493	40493	You	864	” Teray relaxed as Amber had , aware of the tension in the link between them . It was not the tension of a thing on the verge of breaking , but of a thing held in check , ready to spring into action . "
40553	40611	40493	40493	You	864	" said Teray quietly . The ten approaching Patternists came into view from among the trees . Teray ignored them , and felt Amber turn her attention to them , as he had expected her to . She was fast enough to sense any attack from their direction before it could do damage . Teray spoke again . "
40634	40635	40636	40636	You	867	" "
40656	40662	40652	40652	she	868	” And Amber spoke up : "
40688	40702	40706	40706	you	867	" For the first time , the woman took her eyes off Teray . “
40714	40723	40712	40712	Amber	74	” Amber lowered her head slightly in greeting . “
40766	40783	40784	40784	You	867	” Teray picked it up at once , suppressing his surprise that Amber knew the woman . “
40827	40828	40829	40829	I	0	” "
40835	40839	40829	40829	I	0	” she said . “
40872	41071	41072	41072	Lady	876	” She signaled the ten riders now waiting a short distance behind Amber and Teray . The ten began to move forward , clearly intending to herd Teray and Amber before them . But neither Amber nor Teray moved . Through the link , Teray felt Amber 's slight expenditure of strength an instant before he realized what she had done . Then he understood . Six of the horses approaching them - the six closestcollapsed . Shouting with surprise , some of the riders jumped clear . Some fell . All seventeen Patternists had been expecting an attack on themselves , or at least on Darah . This attack on their horses caught them completely by surprise . Amber finished it quickly , giving them no chance to take advantage of the momentary opening in her shield . Teray was instantly on guard to stop any who tried . But there was no movement other than that of the fallen riders and their horses picking themselves up from the ground . None of them seemed to be hurt . And as the Patternists remounted , none of them seemed eager to close with Teray and Amber again . “
41074	41079	41072	41072	Lady	876	” said Amber softly , "
41138	41149	41121	41121	I	0	” 118 PATTERNMASTER The woman held Amber 's gaze steadily . "
41162	41163	41156	41157	My people	170	” "
41175	41176	41177	41177	You	0	” “
41187	41188	41185	41185	Coransee	51	" "
41191	41192	41185	41185	Coransee	51	" “
41221	41222	41224	41224	you	0	” “
41226	41227	41224	41224	you	0	” “
41236	41245	41234	41234	Amber	74	” The woman 's voice had become hard . “
41249	41250	41251	41255	No . . . Lady	880	" “
41257	41258	41251	41255	No . . . Lady	880	" “
41273	41277	41259	41259	I	0	” Amber smiled . “
41283	41284	41280	41280	you	0	" “
41287	41301	41302	41302	I	0	” the woman continued over Amber 's words , speaking to Teray again , “
41320	41321	41312	41313	someone else	1318	” "
41341	41342	41343	41343	I	0	” "
41364	41366	41367	41367	Lady	876	” . "
41407	41418	41403	41403	I	0	” The woman stared at him , then laughed aloud . “
41433	41473	41426	41426	You	0	” She did n't think he was boasting . In fact , Teray thought , in a way she was boasting - assuring him that he was doomed , yet not attacking . Trying to separate Amber from him . “
41483	41502	41503	41503	I	0	” he asked . She said nothing but her people looked more alert . PATTERNMASTER 119 He nodded . “
41515	41634	41507	41507	I	0	” He whipped his horse forward suddenly , sending it straight into Darah and her companions . He was aware of Amber moving beside him but he kept his attention on Darah and her people . Their horses reacted , leaping aside , startled , half rearing before their riders tightened controls on them , calmed them . At a canter , Teray and Amber continued on , Teray now focusing his awareness ahead while Amber focused hers behind on Darah and her people . But Darah was not following . Teray wanted to urge his horse into a headlong gallop , get away before the woman changed her mind . But he knew better . There was no "
41636	42169	42170	42170	Amber	74	” within his immediate reach . Darah could catch him if she wanted to as long as he was anywhere near her home sector . She had allies , no doubtother Housemasters who would be willing to help her . And she had other members of her own House whom she could command to help her . It was all a matter of how much she was willing to lose to repay her debt to Coransee . He had no doubt that she was willing to sacrifice a few of her people . But apparently her own life was another matter . Now if only she did not find someone else more courageous - or more foolhardy - to lead another attack in her place . They rode on , no longer following their roundabout route , but traveling due south across the peninsula . It seemed better to take the chance of riding through more of the sector now than to take the time to ride around it . If Coransee wanted Teray held , then he was coming after him . He was probably already on his way , and possibly not far behind . Teray and Amber had not spoken since their escape , but through the link , Teray could feel Amber 's anxiety . She was as eager to put the sector behind them as he was . She was 120 PATTERNMASTER grimly alert , her awareness now mingling shieldless with his . Together they covered an area nearly twice the size that either of them could have managed alone . With only brief rest stops , they rode on through the evening and into the night , not stopping until they had to , until both they and the horses were too weary to go on . Then they camped in the hills , in a depression too small to be called a valley . It was surrounded by low grassy hills , so that while a Patternist passing nearby might sense them , no one who failed to sense them would see them and have reason to be curious . They lit no fire , ate a cold meal from the rations they had been conserving . Biscuits made that morning , water , jerked beef , and raisins . And for the first time they felt like the fugitives they were . The night passed uneventfully . They slept as usual since the canopy of their awareness guarded them , once set , whether they were awake or asleep . The next morning they ate a quick skimpy breakfast and rode on early . They were no longer within Darah 's sector but they were still close enough to it to be nervous . A little of their urgency was gone , though . They reassured each other , calmed each other , without intending to . They had hardly spoken since escaping from Darah - had hardly communicated in any way beyond sensing each other 's feelings . That had been enough until now . Now Teray was in a more talkative mood . And now he had something to say - perhaps . “
42172	42178	42170	42170	Amber	74	" She glanced at him . “
42186	42187	42181	42181	you	74	” “
42190	42194	42181	42181	you	74	” she said . “
42251	42252	42253	42255	An old lover	892	” “
42260	42266	42253	42255	An old lover	892	” She raised an eyebrow . “
42275	42340	42273	42273	men	1725	" He looked at her for several seconds , studying her . Golden - skinned , small - breasted , slender , strong . Sometimes she looked more like a boy than a woman . But when they lay together at night , their minds and their bodies attuned , enmeshed , there was no mistaking her for anything but a woman . Yet ... “
42350	42359	42346	42346	Amber	74	” She did not pretend to misunderstand him . “
42365	42370	42360	42360	I	0	” she said softly . “
42378	42385	42372	42372	you	74	” He looked away from her . "
42404	42405	42399	42399	I	0	” “
42408	42418	42399	42399	I	0	” she whispered . He pretended not to hear . "
42432	42436	42428	42428	I	0	” she said . “

42626	42639	42616	42616	She	83	” Amber was silent for a moment . Then she smiled ruefully . “
42664	42665	42643	42643	She	83	" "
42672	42677	42668	42668	you	0	” She said nothing . “

42847	42853	42874	42874	her	124	" Be reasonable , Amber ! ”
42854	42870	42871	42871	He	0	" I am . After all , I 'm going to need a lead husband . ”
42891	42909	42871	42871	He	0	“ Why the hell did you stay two years with Coransee if you wanted your own House ? ”
42910	42927	42874	42874	her	124	" To enjoy the man , and to learn from him . I learned a lot . "
42928	42942	42943	42943	PATTERNMASTER	74	" You needed that on top of what you already had from Kai ? ”
42945	42971	42972	42972	Her	124	" I needed it . I did n't want to be just a copy of Kai , running on her memories . Clayarks , Teray . ”
43200	43209	43211	43211	Teray	57	“ If they do n't go any faster , ”
43213	43221	43211	43211	Teray	57	“ we can keep ahead of them . ”
43222	43247	43189	43190	two Patternists	920	“ I 'm not so sure I would n't rather be behind them . I do n't like the idea of their driving us . ”
43248	43275	43211	43211	Teray	57	“ There are supposed to be some mute - era ruins not far ahead of us . Maybe the Clayarks will settle there for a while . ”
43276	43310	43211	43211	Teray	57	“ I do n't think so . I 've been through those ruins . There 's not enough left standing to give shelter to a family of Clayarks , let alone a tribe . ”
43311	43324	43189	43190	two Patternists	920	“ That 's not what one of the stones I studied said . "
43325	43352	43211	43211	Teray	57	" Then that stone was out of date . I think people from 124 PATTERNMASTER Darah 's sector tore the ruins down because they attracted Clayarks . "
43389	43399	43401	43401	Teray	57	" Maybe they 'll stop there out of habit , ”
43403	43418	43401	43401	Teray	57	“ Whether they do or not , we 'd better keep ahead of them . ”
43419	43429	43189	43190	two Patternists	920	“ Or find some cover and let them pass . ”
43430	43461	43401	43401	Teray	57	" No . If they get ahead of us and stop , they 'll spread out . We 'll have to detour back through the hills to get around them . ”
43462	43500	43501	43501	She	924	" Fine . At least we 'll be alive to make the detour . If we stay ahead of them , and they decide to come out of the hills , we 'll have nowhere to go . ”
43523	43526	43527	43527	he	57	" Listen , ”
43530	43546	43527	43527	he	57	" if you want to stay here and let them pass you , go ahead . ”
43547	43550	43551	43551	He	57	“ Teray ... "
43557	43585	43551	43551	He	57	“ We ca n't afford this . Only people safe and secure in Houses can afford to let their emotions get in the way of their judgment . "
43586	43594	43527	43527	he	57	“ Do you want to stay behind ? ”
43595	43641	43666	43666	she	924	“ Yes . But I wo n't . I 'll stay with you unless the Clayarks start to veer in our direction . If that happens and you still have n't cooled off , I 'll stay back and watch you go to meet them . ”
44601	44608	44595	44595	he	57	" How far away is he ? ”
44642	44655	44656	44656	Amber	74	“ Not far . He 'll be here in a few minutes . ”
44682	44687	44672	44672	Teray	57	“ Cut him off ! ”
44708	44724	44695	44695	She	74	" If he 's almost here , surely you can wait to talk to him . "
44732	44741	44729	44729	She	74	“ I was trying to bargain with him . ”
44825	44835	44819	44819	his	57	“ I assume you failed - in your bargaining . "
44836	44841	44842	44842	He	57	" I think so . ”
44849	44862	44842	44842	He	57	" I could have told you you would . But thanks anyway . ”
44863	44872	44819	44819	his	57	“ He wants to take you back alive . ”
44873	44878	44879	44879	She	74	“ He wo n't . ”
44882	44905	44879	44879	She	74	" If we were n't so close , you and I , I 'd try to get you to change your mind . ”
44906	44909	44819	44819	his	57	" No . "
44910	44925	44926	44926	He	57	" I know . We 're alike that way . Stubborn beyond any reasoning . "
44941	44957	44939	44939	him	57	“ Look , I want you to stay out of it when he gets here . "
44958	44961	44962	44962	He	57	" No . "
44969	44991	44962	44962	He	57	“ Amber , I mean it . He is n't Darah , to be frightened off . He 'll kill you . "
44992	45003	45004	45004	He	57	“ Maybe . But he 'll surely kill you alone . ”
45040	45043	45044	45044	she	74	" Teray , ”
45047	45102	45044	45044	she	74	" please . This is n't an ordinary confrontation . He made you his outsider illegally . You have n't challenged him . You do n't want anything he has . He 's dead wrong , but he 's still going to kill you . Your only possible chance is for me to help . ”
45103	45133	45134	45134	She	957	“ I said no . He 'll face me alone , without any of his people backing him . That 's the way I 'll have to face him . ”
45149	45157	45158	45158	she	957	“ The hell with your stupid pride , "
45163	45229	45161	45161	PATTERNMASTER	84	" You 've forgotten that I do n't want to go back to Redhill any more than you do . You 'd better link up with me again , because when he hits you , I 'm going to hit him . If we are n't linked , one of us is liable to get killed , without doing the other any good at all . ”
45230	45236	45161	45161	PATTERNMASTER	84	" Amber , no ... ! "
45237	45242	45243	45243	He	959	" Link . Now ! ”
45334	45345	45314	45314	He	51	" I do n't suppose you persuaded him to submit . ”
45346	45352	45307	45307	Coransee	51	" I did n't try . ”
45353	45369	45389	45389	He	51	“ And you 're staying with him . I thought you were brighter than that . ”
45370	45388	45389	45389	He	51	“ No , you thought I was more frightened of you than that . You were mistaken . ”
45400	45413	45389	45389	He	51	“ Teray . . . do you really want to die here ? ”
45414	45442	45443	45443	Coransee	51	“ I 'll either die here or I 'll go on to Forsyth . Nothing is going to get me to go back to Redhill with you . "
45446	45458	45443	45443	Coransee	51	“ What did you expect to find in Forsyth , anyway ? "
45459	45462	45389	45389	He	51	“ Sanctuary . ”
45472	45479	45463	45463	Coransee	51	“ Sanctuary ? For how long ? ”
45480	45500	45389	45389	He	51	" Even if it was only for a few months , at least I 'd spend them in freedom . ”
45501	45514	45516	45516	PATTERNMASTER	74	" You 'd spend them learning everything you could to defeat me . ”
45517	45527	45516	45516	PATTERNMASTER	74	" Only because you 've left me no choice . ”
45528	45541	45542	45542	Coransee	51	“ I left you one very simple choice and you . . . "
45550	45592	45542	45542	Coransee	51	“ There 's no point in arguing that with you again . Whether you believe it or not , though , I really do n't want to kill you . Look . . . I 'll give you one more choice . ”
45593	45597	45599	45599	Teray	57	“ What choice ? ”
45602	45635	45636	45636	Teray	57	“ Not much of one , maybe . It 's just that even with our ancestry , I find myself wondering more and more how much of a threat you could become . ”
45646	45666	45636	45636	Teray	57	" Left alone I 'd be no threat to you at all . I 've already told you that . ”
45667	45712	45542	45542	Coransee	51	“ And it still does n't mean a thing . It 's not your promises I 'm interested in , it 's your potential , and that 's something I can only guess at . Rayal would be able to do more than guess . ”
45713	45721	45599	45599	Teray	57	“ You want Rayal to evaluate me ? ”
45722	45725	45636	45636	Teray	57	“ Yes . ”
45726	45749	45542	45542	Coransee	51	“ What would happen if he found out that I ... that I did n't have the potential to interfere with you ? ”
45772	45793	45767	45767	he	57	“ What will you do with me if I turn out to be too weak ever to stand against you ? "
45794	45802	45636	45636	Teray	57	“ What do you want to happen ? "
45803	45809	45636	45636	Teray	57	" I want my freedom ! "
45810	45814	45636	45636	Teray	57	“ No more ? ”
45815	45823	45824	45824	Coransee	51	“ Freedom from you will be enough . ”
45827	45849	45824	45824	Coransee	51	“ You would n't ask me for more , no matter how much you wanted it , would you , brother ? ”
45854	45867	45850	45850	Teray	57	“ No matter . Are you willing to be judged by Rayal ? ”
45868	45871	45636	45636	Teray	57	“ Yes . ”
45872	45919	45920	45920	Teray	57	“ We 'll go on to Forsyth , then . We 're nearly there and I PATTERNMASTER 131 want to see Rayal anyway . But there is one more thing . Only Rayal 's findings can free you . You go to Forsyth as my outsider . "
45923	45927	45920	45920	Teray	57	" My property . ”
45928	45934	45636	45636	Teray	57	" You 've captured me . ”
45935	45940	45941	45941	Teray	57	" Say the words . "
45949	45968	45941	45941	Teray	57	“ I 've wasted enough time with you , Teray . Say the words or face me now . "
46021	46027	46029	46029	Teray	57	" I am your outsider , "
46032	46036	46029	46029	Teray	57	“ Your property . ”
46585	46600	46601	46602	the Housemaster	1224	" You looked as though you were just about to reach out to her , ”
46605	46615	46601	46602	the Housemaster	1224	" To help her . She might need it . "
46616	46636	46640	46640	him	1224	" No . I 've seen her badly hurt before . She manages better if she 's left alone . ”
46751	46764	46740	46740	Coransee	51	“ Were you speeding up a little just before she was shot ? ”
46765	46781	46847	46847	Coransee	51	“ Yes , to talk to you . To talk about her , in fact . ”
46782	46815	46816	46816	Teray	57	“ That 's interesting . From what Lias said - she was riding just behind Amber - if you had n't moved when you did , the bullet would have hit you . "
46825	46839	46816	46816	Teray	57	" It was probably you they were aiming at . You were lucky . ”
46840	46846	46847	46847	Coransee	51	" Where was the Clayark ? ”
46854	46895	46847	46847	Coransee	51	" He was high and far back , but he waited until you and Amber were almost directly in front of him . I hope they do n't have many rifles or riflemen who can make that kind of shot . ”
46896	46907	46816	46816	Teray	57	“ Well , at least now they have one less . ”
46908	46915	46916	46916	Teray	57	“ No . We lost him . "
46922	46934	46916	46916	Teray	57	“ All of you ? You could n't catch one Clayark ? ”
46940	46949	46935	46935	Coransee	51	“ That 's what I said , brother . ”
46961	46981	46982	46982	He	57	" I do n't see how you could possibly have missed him . So many of you . . . ”
46988	46997	46982	46982	He	57	“ Lord , are you linked with anyone ? ”
46998	47011	47026	47026	Coransee	51	" I 'm not , but the others are linked in pairs . "
47064	47067	47069	47069	Coransee	51	" Blame ? ”
47072	47092	47069	47069	Coransee	51	" What are we doing out here between sectors with the Clayarks , Teray ? Why are we here ? ”
47100	47170	47093	47093	Teray	57	“ All right , make it my fault if you want to . But you know as well as I do that you should link up with at least some of your people . You could stand it with a couple of them even though they 're not close to you . Hell , you 're the one who wants the Pattern . That will link you with everyone . ”
47186	47190	47192	47192	Coransee	51	" You know , ”
47195	47230	47192	47192	Coransee	51	“ I would have stopped you some words back if I did n't realize you were speaking out of your feelings for the woman . But even for that , you 've said enough . ”
47406	47431	47390	47390	He	57	" You 're right , Lord , I did speak out of love for her . I ... do you intend to keep her ? ”
47432	47435	47390	47390	He	57	“ Yes . ”
47436	47457	47390	47390	He	57	" I was afraid you did . If Rayal 's findings free me , will you let me buy her ? ”
47458	47464	47390	47390	He	57	“ Buy her with what ? ”
47465	47504	47390	47390	He	57	“ With service , brother , work . I had planned never to see Redhill again if I was freed . But I 'll go back and work at whatever you say if my service will buy her . ”
47513	47539	47506	47506	Coransee	51	“ You 're welcome to come back to Redhill , to my House , if you 're freed . But she 's not for sale . "
47544	47555	47540	47540	Coransee	51	“ You 'd never be able to hold her anyway . "
47556	47580	47390	47390	He	57	“ I would n't try to hold her against her will . I want her as my wife , not as my prisoner . ”
47581	47619	47620	47620	Amber	74	" You wo n't have her as either . At least not until I 'm tired of her . But you 'll have the same access to her as any other outsider if you return with me . ”
47645	47649	47651	47651	Coransee	51	“ Of course , ”
47655	47666	47667	47667	Amber	74	" you can have it all what you 'll get . ”
47784	47792	47793	47793	She	74	" I 'm an independent , Lord . ”
47801	47824	47793	47793	She	74	" I 'm an independent because most people realize how much trouble I can cause them if they try to hold me . ”
47825	47836	47778	47778	Her	74	" You think I do n't , after two years ? "
47837	47848	47793	47793	She	74	" I think you have n't thought about it enough . "
47849	47856	47793	47793	She	74	“ That sounds like a warning . "
47857	47872	47873	47873	He	989	" Good . At least you know me well enough to understand that much . ”
47908	47917	47918	47918	he	989	" I 've taken you into my House , ”
47921	47934	47918	47918	he	989	“ You belong to me . You do n't give me warnings . ”
47935	47943	47944	47944	Her	74	" I 'll give you this one ! ”
47951	47968	47969	47969	Teray	57	" Hit me again and you wo n't have an undamaged organ left in your body ! ”
47992	48002	48004	48005	the Housemaster	1224	“ This is none of your business , Teray , "
48007	48040	48004	48005	the Housemaster	1224	“ Lord , she 's just recovering from a wound that would have killed anyone else . Ca n't you at least wait until she 's rested before you start on her ? ”
48050	48064	48041	48041	Amber	74	“ Stay out of it , Teray . You 've made your deal . ”
48065	48069	48070	48070	He	57	" Keep quiet . ”
48129	48134	48135	48135	he	57	“ We 're one , ”
48139	48155	48135	48135	he	57	“ She and I are one . Attacking her is the same as attacking me . ”
48164	48173	48156	48156	Coransee	51	" She 's worth your life to you ? ”
48176	48180	48183	48183	he	57	" She is . ”
48214	48224	48225	48226	the Housemaster	1224	“ Has she already agreed to stay with you ? "
48237	48248	48249	48249	Coransee	51	" No , Lord . In fact , she refused . "
48253	48264	48249	48249	Coransee	51	“ Then you 're a bigger fool than I thought . ”
48279	48301	48274	48274	Coransee	51	“ Would you let him throw away his foolish life for you , girl ? You know I 'd kill him . "
48307	48329	48330	48330	He	51	“ You might even have some chance against me since I 'm no healer . He 'd have none at all . ”
48335	48344	48345	48345	Amber	74	" Do you really want my life now ? ”
48349	48366	48367	48367	He	51	" Are you trying to move him out of your way so you can kill me ? "
48370	48399	48367	48367	He	51	“ I doubt that that would be necessary . Believe it or not , what I 'm trying very hard to do is keep both of you alive . ”
48400	48409	48274	48274	Coransee	51	“ Then what do you want from me ? ”
48410	48467	48367	48367	He	51	“ For now , a link . I want you to open and let me see what slowly lethal thing you may already have done to my body . Then I want a link that will let me know if you try to do it again . Only that in place of the beating you deserve . "
48468	48475	48367	48367	He	51	" I 'm linked with Teray . "
48476	48519	48520	48520	She	994	“ That 's your problem - and his . To keep you from murdering me , I need a link with you . You warned me , after all . Refuse , and I 'll have to kill you here and now . ”
48534	48547	48548	48548	he	57	" If you decide to fight , I 'll stand with you , "
48551	48554	48548	48548	he	57	" No . "
48557	48569	48367	48367	He	51	“ We have a chance . Your strength coupled with mine ... "
48570	48575	48576	48576	She	994	“ No , Teray . ”
48593	48621	48622	48622	She	994	“ Not now . Not unless I have to , and especially not with you . I 'm too tired , drained . I might fail you . ”
48625	48632	48622	48622	She	994	“ Shall I break our link ? ”
48633	48643	48367	48367	He	51	“ Break it ? No , of course not . ”
48644	48655	48367	48367	He	51	“ But you 'll be joined with him through me . ”
48656	48683	48622	48622	She	994	" Only incidentally . He wo n't be able to read me any more than he already does . He and I are too far apart . "
48684	48704	48367	48367	He	51	“ But . . . he 'll be more aware of you . You wo n't be able to ... "
48705	48739	48367	48367	He	51	“ Take him by surprise ? I probably could n't anyway . Besides , if you want our link broken , you do n't have to ask . You can just break it . ”
48740	48767	48768	48768	He	996	" I do n't want to . I should , for your sake , but I do n't want to . I want you with me . "
49090	49099	49100	49100	he	57	" Can we rest here for a while ? ”
49104	49115	49100	49100	he	57	" You can probably feel how far gone she is . ”
49116	49120	49121	49121	Coransee	51	" Is she ? ”
49126	49138	49121	49121	Coransee	51	“ Tell him what you were going to do to me . "
49139	49159	49100	49100	he	57	“ What difference does it make ? I ca n't do it now without alerting you ahead of time . "
49160	49166	49167	49167	She	74	" I said tell him ! ”
49179	49213	49167	49167	She	74	“ I was going to try to kill him tonight while he slept . The way we kill Clayarks . It might have worked if I could have caught him completely off guard . ”
49218	49249	49214	49214	Coransee	51	“ Anytime you want to try your luck , healer , you can face me . But it will be face to face , with both of us wide awake . ”
49254	49269	49250	49250	She	74	“ Now , are you ready to go on or are you too tired ? ”
49270	49283	49284	49284	Teray	57	" I 'm tired , Lord , but I can go on . ”
49301	49309	49311	49311	Coransee	51	“ Get to your horses , then , ”
49325	49330	49332	49332	Amber	74	“ At this point , ”
49335	49390	49332	49332	Amber	74	“ I think he would have killed me regardless of the damage I 'd do him before I died . Killed me and left me here . He 's angry enough to take the risk . He still has the nerve to be outraged when he finds someone else trying to take unfair advantage . ”
49391	49399	49311	49311	Coransee	51	“ Would you really have done it ? ”
49400	49463	49332	49332	Amber	74	“ Of course I would have done it . That 's why he 's so angry -- and that 's why he 's more than a little worried . He 's starting to think . He 's thinking about how far he is from the nearest healer - other than me . God , I wish I did n't feel so weak ! "
49464	49476	49311	49311	Coransee	51	“ I should have attacked him the moment I saw him . "
49477	49487	49488	49488	He	1003	“ You have n't given up , have you ? ”
49495	49500	49488	49488	He	1003	“ Of course not . ”
49528	49529	49548	49548	he	1003	" “
49535	49536	49548	49548	he	1003	" "
49556	49557	49548	49548	he	1003	" "
49571	49572	49573	49573	I	0	" "
49614	49621	49622	49622	You	1004	” Teray glanced back toward Coransee . "
49633	49638	49624	49624	you	1004	” She smiled tiredly . "
49651	49702	49647	49647	you	1004	” They traveled for the rest of the day , Teray offering Amber as much of his own strength as she needed . She acPATTERNMASTER 143 cepted only until she found in her rations enough readily edible food to steady herself . She refused Teray 's offer of his rations . "
49718	49992	49716	49716	yourself	1004	” she told him . Teray 's awareness of Coransee 's link had dulled , was nothing more than an annoyance now . It kept Teray tense , made him do more looking over his shoulder than necessary , but that was just as well . The canopy of his awareness , spread as he had vowed it would be , covered even less of the area around him than it normally would have covered unassisted . This was not only because he had given part of his strength to help Amber , but because he was tired himself . He was worried about the Clayark sniper . If the creature fired again from as far away as he had when he hit Amber , Teray would have no chance of sensing him . Then there was the possibility that Teray had not had time to think about . The possibility that Coransee had been more right than he knew when he suspected that the Clayark had been aiming at Teray . They made camp that night against a long rocky ledge . They had not heard or sensed anything more from the Clayarks , but one of Coransee 's women had sensed a doe back in the hills and lured it out . After everyone had eaten , Teray called Coransee aside . ! The Housemaster had apparently gotten over his angeror he remained angry only at Amber . He followed Teray away from the group far enough along the rock ledge to be out of earshot . There he told Coransee of the Clayark he had talked to before leaving Redhill . "
49999	50003	50004	50004	It	1007	” he finished . “
50013	50014	50004	50004	It	1007	” “
50035	50038	50018	50019	the sniper	1009	” 144 PATTERNMASTER "
50094	50100	50091	50091	Rayal	59	” Coransee frowned , thinking . “
50152	50153	50150	50150	you	0	” "
50156	50162	50150	50150	you	0	" Coransee raised an eyebrow . "
50175	50182	50183	50183	You	0	" Coransee looked away , exasperated . “
50201	50279	50280	50280	Brother	64	" Without a word , Teray turned away to go back to the fire . He had delivered his message . Only hours before , Coransee had made a mistake that had almost cost Amber her life . A mistake that the Housemaster not only did not want to be told about , but that he had not yet bothered to correct . He had certainly not linked with Amber to widen the range of his awareness . "
50282	50289	50280	50280	Brother	64	” Teray looked around at him . “
50292	50312	50313	50313	Brother	64	” said Coransee simply . As though he were calling an animal , Teray thought . Or a mute . “
50315	50328	50313	50313	Brother	64	” Teray trudged back . Coransee leaned against the ledge , relaxed . “
50337	50349	50350	50350	Amber	74	” Teray stared at him , speechless , for a moment . “
50352	50353	50356	50356	Amber	74	” “
50365	50403	50358	50358	You	64	" It was his right since he had claimed Amber . No woman of his House had the right to refuse him . His women could refuse any other man if they wished , but not him . “
50411	50415	50418	50418	yourself	64	" said Teray , "
50420	50448	50418	50418	yourself	64	” Coransee could have called her without moving from where he was or saying a word aloud . But he preferred to humiliate Teray . Coransee smiled . “
50464	50465	50466	50466	You	64	" “
50510	50511	50504	50504	she	74	” “
50528	50541	50519	50519	I	0	" Teray glared at him , hearing the challenge , ignoring it . "
50614	50720	50721	50721	I	0	” Teray completely surprised both himself and Coransee . He smashed his fist hard into the Housemaster 's face . Caught off guard , Coransee stumbled and fell to the ground . Teray turned and , without hurrying , walked back to the group . He was tensed and ready to defend himself if Coransee attacked , but surprisingly the Housemaster let him go . Amber was not beside the fire . He looked around and saw her preparing their pallet a short distance away from the others against the ledge . He went over to her and she turned to look at him apprehensively . “
50733	50737	50721	50721	I	0	" she said . “
50757	50758	50747	50747	you	1023	" "
50763	50838	50759	50759	He	1024	” said Teray tonelessly . She was on her knees on the blankets , looking up at him . 146 PATTERNMASTER Now , after a moment of surprise , she rose and walked a few steps away and stood with her back to him . The contained fury he sensed in her alarmed him . He went to her and put his hands on her shoulders . She turned and was in his arms . "
50855	50859	50839	50839	I	0	” she muttered . “
50866	50867	50864	50864	Teray	57	" “
50872	50873	50864	50864	Teray	57	” "
50884	50890	50891	50891	He	1024	” Her voice grew bitter . "
50913	50914	50905	50905	He	1024	" "
50918	50919	50905	50905	He	1024	” “
50948	50949	50939	50939	I	0	” “

51139	51149	51170	51170	I	0	” She took a deep breath , slowed down . “
51195	51218	51219	51219	You	57	” PATTERNMASTER 147 She bent to pick up a blanket . He caught her arm . They straightened , facing each other . "
51226	51231	51219	51219	You	57	” he told her . “
51250	51265	51268	51268	you	57	" Without speaking , she severed the link . Solitude came to him jarringly . “
51279	51280	51281	51281	You	57	” “
51295	51317	51281	51281	You	57	” Understanding , Teray grimaced . For the second time that day , their extreme closeness made the link a handicap . “
51321	51325	51281	51281	You	57	” he said . “
51351	51352	51343	51343	I	0	" "
51357	51361	51362	51362	My	0	” she said . “
51365	51403	51362	51362	My	0	” From anyone else , that would have been enough to stop him . But he knew her better than he had ever known anyone else . He did not believe she really wanted him to stop . “
51407	51425	51362	51362	My	0	” he said quietly . He was still holding her arm and she wrenched away from him . "
51436	51440	51430	51431	a fool	1028	” she said . “
51452	51453	51430	51431	a fool	1028	” “
51463	51472	51456	51456	you	57	" She gave a short , mirthless laugh . "
51514	51528	51507	51507	I	0	” For a moment Teray 's surprise left him without words . Finally , “
51536	51538	51531	51531	you	0	” . "
51569	51570	51564	51564	he	51	" “
51583	51586	51587	51587	You	57	" 148 PATTERNMASTER "
51614	51615	51616	51616	He	51	” "
51625	51629	51616	51616	He	51	” Teray frowned . “
51660	51661	51649	51649	he	51	" “
51684	51685	51686	51686	You	57	" “
51704	51705	51692	51692	I	0	” "
51712	51716	51706	51706	I	0	" she said . “
51736	51740	51728	51728	you	57	” Teray winced . “
51745	51746	51728	51728	you	57	” "
51757	51758	51751	51751	him	51	" “
51769	51770	51761	51761	you	0	” "
51797	51798	51783	51783	He	51	" "

51833	51837	51818	51818	He	51	” She sighed . “
51860	51864	51865	51865	I	0	" Teray frowned . “
51884	51885	51877	51877	you	0	" "
51904	51905	51893	51893	You	0	" "
51936	51937	51927	51927	Coransee	51	” "
51945	51950	51938	51938	I	0	” she said softly , "
51987	51988	52018	52018	PATTERNMASTER	1156	” “
51995	52005	52018	52018	PATTERNMASTER	1156	” He hugged her and suddenly found himself smiling . “
52042	52043	52044	52044	He	51	” "
52062	52165	52052	52052	He	51	” Teray laughed softly . She had given him a kind of victory . Not a large victory , but one he could savor . One that Coransee 's humiliations could not destroy . And the child would be a living link between them even if Teray was unable to convince her to stay with him . Or it would be a part of him that survived even if Coransee succeeded in killing him . But he did not want to think about that last . Living suddenly seemed more important than ever . Living and keeping Amber and the child alive . “
52168	52183	52166	52166	Teray	57	" He looked at her , knowing that she was about to leave him . “
52201	52271	52196	52196	him	51	" He told her . She smiled a very small smile , kissed him , gathered up a blanket , and went to Coransee . CHAPTER EIGHT Amber returned to Teray before breakfast the next morning . She was quiet and withdrawn . She seemed to relax a little when he asked her to link up again . But through the reestablished link he could feel her smoldering anger . “
52279	52280	52273	52273	he	51	” "
52283	52291	52273	52273	he	51	” The anger flared for a moment . “
52297	52303	52293	52293	you	57	” She did not answer . "
52310	52311	52305	52306	the child	2049	” “
52332	52341	52323	52323	I	0	” Now Teray felt anger of his own . “
52348	52349	52350	52350	God	68	” "
52352	52356	52350	52350	God	68	” she whispered . “
52363	52364	52350	52350	God	68	" “
52390	52391	52392	52392	He	2049	" "
52427	52465	52415	52415	he	2049	" Teray looked toward the main group and saw Coransee standing encircled by his people . He was talking to them , and though Teray could not hear what he was saying , Teray felt suddenly apprehensive . “
52476	52482	52484	52484	he	2049	" said Amber . 152 PATTERNMASTER "
52489	52490	52484	52484	he	2049	” "
52584	52588	52589	52589	I	0	” Teray nodded . “
52602	52603	52598	52598	I	0	" "
52623	52624	52604	52604	You	0	” “
52674	52675	52671	52671	I	0	” "
52681	52685	52677	52677	I	0	” said Amber , “
52711	52712	52703	52703	He	2049	” “
52722	52723	52724	52724	He	2049	” "
52774	52775	52765	52765	He	2049	" “
52803	52804	52786	52786	Rayal	59	" “
52861	52862	52867	52867	he	2049	” "
52905	52908	52910	52910	you	0	” PATTERNMASTER 153 "
52916	52917	52918	52918	I	0	" "
52934	52935	52932	52932	you	0	” "
52942	52959	52932	52932	you	0	" she said . He frowned at her , surprised . He had expected an argument . "
52969	52973	52961	52961	you	0	” she said . “
53026	53065	53008	53008	he	2049	” She was n't just angry , he realized . She was bitter and resigned . Her last sentence reminded Teray of what he had said when Michael asked him whether he could ever accept Coransee 's controls . "
53068	53073	53008	53008	he	2049	” he said softly , “
53141	53169	53170	53170	I	0	” He wondered what the chances were of her breaking free of ten Patternists . They had to be far worse than his chances of killing Coransee . “
53174	53178	53170	53170	I	0	" he said . “
53183	53195	53196	53196	He	2049	” He did not answer . Their eyes met in understanding . "
53202	53206	53196	53196	He	2049	” she said . “
53210	53553	53554	53554	I	0	” As it happened , though , Coransee , like everyone else , was kept busy enough watching for Clayarks . The Clayarks were apparently closing in for the kill . At least one sniper was with the Patternists constantly , sometimes more than one . The creatures kept out of sight , traveling through the hills . And they kept out of range — just out of Teray and Amber 's combined range . It had occurred 154 PATTERNMASTER to Teray that one of the reasons Coransee still permitted him to link with Amber was the unusually wide range of their awareness . That and the knowledge that no other linked pair was as anxious about Clayarks , after what had happened the day before . The group had come a short distance inland , crossing a small peninsula . In the clear air , they could see the ocean in the distance as they rode over a slight rise . There were Clayarks in the hills alongside them , firing uselessly . The Patternists had become used to them . But as the Patternists reached the top of the rise and looked down at the land and the vast expanse of ocean , a single deeper , louder shot thundered out . One shot . Teray knew nothing more than that the sound seemed to have come from ahead of them , and that neither he nor Amber had been hit . He snatched more strength from her , reached , stretched , extending their combined perception as far as he could ahead of them , sweeping a wide area , finding and killing a single Clayark . There was only one in range . Teray shifted his attention back to the Patternists and realized that they had stopped . Coransee had dismounted or fallen from his horse . He was kneeling on the ground , Amber approaching him , others dismounting , going toward him . Teray swung down from his horse quickly and strode over to the Housemaster . "
53559	53566	53554	53554	I	0	” Coransee was saying to Amber . "
53580	53617	53554	53554	I	0	” He turned sharply as Teray approached . For a moment they stared at each other , Teray assessing the damage with his eyes alone . His mind was suddenly tightly shielded . Coransee said softly , "
53633	53690	53624	53625	the Clayarks	43	" Teray relaxed slightly , cautiously . Coransee 's wound was PATTERNMASTER 155 not serious . The bullet had only torn through the flesh of his shoulder . He was not incapacitated mentally , not forced to give large amounts of his attention to keeping himself alive . He was no more vulnerable for his wound . "
53697	53703	53691	53691	You	262	” said Coransee with surprise . "
53724	53725	53717	53717	you	262	” "
53739	53744	53727	53727	you	0	" said Teray softly . "
53762	53907	53751	53751	you	262	” Teray met Coransee 's eyes levelly , but he was shaking inside with reaction to what he had almost done . And he was shaking with anger - anger at himself . He had been too obvious , in too much of a hurry . If Coransee had not turned and spoken , Teray might have made a fatal error . Inexperience . Never in Teray 's life had he stooped to attacking a wounded person . He was surprised now at how ready he had been to do it . Coransee had indeed been a good teacher . But Teray found himself a little ashamed of having learned this particular lesson . He would do it again if he had the opportunity . But he would n't learn to like it . Coransee seemed to read his emotion . The Housemaster smiled . “
53915	53919	53910	53910	you	1059	” he said . “
53938	53983	53931	53931	I	0	” Coransee turned from him and began healing his wound . Teray glanced at Amber and saw that she had been quietly surrounded by Coransee 's people — just in case . Frustrated and angry , Teray went back to his horse and remounted . "
53992	54000	53986	53986	you	1059	” Coransee asked , looking up again . "
54020	54023	54016	54016	he	1060	” 156 PATTERNMASTER “
54027	54035	54016	54016	he	1060	” Somehow , Teray controlled his temper . “
54079	54100	54101	54101	You	1059	” As Teray spoke , Amber went back to her horse , watched but not stopped by Coransee 's people . "
54106	54110	54101	54101	You	1059	” said Coransee . “
54119	54120	54101	54101	You	1059	" “
54125	54129	54123	54123	Lord	1063	” said Amber . “
54144	54151	54154	54154	him	1063	" Coransee stared at her coldly . “
54176	54182	54173	54173	my	0	” He looked at Teray . “
54195	54211	54212	54212	I	0	” Without answering , the two urged their horses forward , away from the group . "
54218	54222	54212	54212	I	0	" said Teray . "
54238	54243	54173	54173	my	0	” Amber said nothing . "
54252	54265	54173	54173	my	0	" He looked at her . Her face was too carefully expressionless . “
54273	54274	54173	54173	my	0	” “
54283	54284	54173	54173	my	0	” "
54287	54288	54173	54173	my	0	" “
54305	54318	54298	54298	you	0	” Teray frowned and turned to stare at her with sudden realization . "
54333	54337	54323	54323	you	0	" she said . “
54381	54388	54371	54371	you	0	" Teray shook his head miserably . "
54396	54400	54389	54389	I	0	” he said . “
54424	54425	54426	54426	I	0	” “
54470	54471	54473	54473	he	57	” "
54499	54500	54486	54489	None of his people	1067	" “
54535	54766	54532	54533	the Clayarks	43	" They came upon the Clayark sprawled on the side of a low hill , his rifle lying beside him . They did not touch the weapon . Patternists had learned through bitter experience that Clayarks often booby - trapped their rifles just before using them - set them to inject a little recently taken saliva into the fingers of unwary Patternists . This could be done with nothing more than a few well - placed wood or metal splinters . Kept warm and moist , the Clayark disease organism could live for a few moments outside a human body . Teray and Amber only observed that the rifle was not the usual Clayark weapon , as Teray had thought . It was heavier , and doubtless more powerful . Neither Teray nor Amber had seen one like it before . Mounted atop it was a telescopic sight that had already proven its usefulness . In the past , Clayarks had rarely used such things . But then , in the past , Clayarks had not shot Patternists from nearly a kilometer away with rifles . Either the long period of Rayal 's illness had given them time to improve their weaponry or they were simply bring- 158 PATTERNMASTER ing out their best guns — and their best marksmen - to kill two of Rayal 's sons . Probably both . "
54775	54779	54769	54769	we	1070	” said Amber . “
54783	54784	54769	54769	we	1070	” “
54791	54804	54788	54788	you	1071	” Teray stared at the polished wood of the rifle 's stock . “
54824	54825	54788	54788	you	1071	" “
54835	55221	55222	55222	You	1072	" Teray probed at the rifle where it lay , and sensed the three remaining bullets . He nodded . Then as Amber covered it with the driest grass she could find , Teray reached down to Coransee . He did not want contact with the Housemaster , but it was necessary . He found Coransee waiting for them , apparently finished healing his shoulder . You 're going to hear shots , Teray sent . It will be us destroying the gun . Warn the others . He was carefully open enough so that Coransee could see that he was telling the truth - that open , and no more . Coransee returned wordless agreement . Teray brought his attention back to Amber and saw that she was ready . She lit the grass , then both she and Teray took cover down the opposite slope of the hill . There , while Teray kept watch for Clayarks , Amber saw that the tiny fire did its work . As the fire heated the metal of the gun 's receiver , Amber extended her perception into the metal itself and observed minutely the reaction of the metal to the fire - how it changed as it heated . She claimed later that she had never examined an inanimate object so closely before . But she seemed to have no difficulty doing it . She observed the quickening motion of the molecules of the metal . And once she had observed it , understood it , she could control it . She could intensify the heat of the metal to a point beyond the ability of the tiny dying fire . For a moment she sweated , concentrated on doing the unfamiliar PATTERNMASTER 159 thing . Then the three cartridges exploded almost simultaneously . The rifle leaped into the air with a roar . It fell to earth in two pieces , receiver blown open , stock and barrel completely separated . The pieces landed heavily on the body of their Clayark owner . Teray and Amber went down the hill to where they had left their horses and found that Coransee and the others had ridden forward to meet them . Immediately Coransee gestured Teray up beside him . He spoke as they rode . “
55240	55241	55238	55238	you	1072	” "
55245	55246	55238	55238	you	1072	” “
55256	55257	55253	55253	However	88	" “
55263	55264	55260	55260	you	1072	” “
55290	55332	55281	55281	you	1072	" Teray looked away from him in silent defeat and desperation . As careful as he had been , Coransee had read himhad read him as easily as he had that first time months before on the day Teray left school . "
55339	56292	56293	56293	He	1075	” After a moment , Teray obeyed and dropped back silently to his place beside Amber . Everything Coransee did made Teray more aware of how little chance he had of surviving a fight with the Housemaster . He had let himself hope , let himself forget . Coransee might make even quicker work of him this time , because this time the Housemaster would be out to kill instead of only to subdue . Teray would die . Then Coransee would turn his attention to Amber . Eventually she would die . The embryo growing within her would die . Painfully , Teray considered giving in , submitting to Coransee 's control . It was not something he would do to save himself . Could he do it for Amber 's sake ? 160 PATTERNMASTER He had not done it for Iray 's , and Iray had been his wife . He thought about it , head down , perception indrawn , not caring at this point whether the Clayarks shot him or not . No . No , that was stupid . Dying by a Clayark bullet would be the same as dying in combat with Coransee . Amber would still be left to the Housemaster . In fact , even if Teray submitted to Coransee 's controls , Coransee would still be free to kill Amber . Teray would be of no more help to her than Joachim had been to Teray . Submitting would solve nothing even if he could have done it . And he could n't have . He could n't . Amber . What could he do to help her , beyond trying to cripple Coransee ? And with ten Patternists restraining her , how could she get to Coransee if Teray did manage to cripple him ? He looked at her , then looked away . She was watching him . She was beside him , watching him , yet he had never felt so cut off from her . He could not link with her or speak openly to her . And tonight , against her will and his , she would again share Coransee 's pallet . Teray turned his thoughts away from that quickly . In that direction lay fury , recklessness , death . And he realized now more than ever that to be of any help at all to Amber , he had to find a way to keep himself alive . If there was a way . Teray found himself thinking about Rayal . Journeyman Michael had promised Teray sanctuary if Teray managed to reach Forsyth on his own . How much of a difference would it make to Rayal if Teray reached Forsyth not on his own , but in tow , the acknowledged outsider of Coransee ? Not a successful runaway , but an outsider . How much did Rayal care about either of his two strongest sons ? He was the one man who could surely take Teray from Coransee if he wanted to . But would he want to ? Apparently he had all PATTERNMASTER 161 but openly designated Coransee his heir . That was contrary to the law of succession , but who was going to force Rayal to obey the law ? And if Rayal had chosen Coransee , why would he now oppose Coransee over Teray ? But then , why should Rayal have offered Teray sanctuary at all ? Would it be worth Teray 's while to trust Rayal , go on to Forsyth , giving up any hope of leaving a crippled Coransee for Amber to kill ? If only he could reach Rayal and find out before he arrived at Forsyth . But he did not know Rayal . He had never had any communication with him , and never recorded within his memory the knowledge of anyone who had . That meant that he could not call Rayal as , for instance , he could call Coransee or Amber . It was possible that Amber had met the Patternmaster on her last trip to Forsyth and could share her knowledge of him with Teray . But Teray did not dare to ask her . Thus , there was only one way for him to reach Rayal . One illegal way . Through the Pattern . Since the Pattern connected each individual Patternist with Rayal , in theory , any Patternist , however lowly , could use it to contact Rayal . In fact , though , the use of the Pattern for communication was restricted to Housemasters , Schoolmasters , Rayal 's journeymen , and Rayal himself . Rayal , of course , could use it whenever he chose , but Housemasters , Schoolmasters , and journeymen were permitted to use it only to report a Clayark emergency . Lately Rayal had chosen to ignore their emergencies . It was possible that he would also ignore Teray 's . He might even punish Teray for misusing the Pattern . But Teray had to take that risk . Had to take it soon - that night . Forsyth was getting closer . That night when everyone was bedding down , Amber stole a few moments from Coransee and came to sit on 162 PATTERNMASTER Teray 's pallet . She said little . She simply took Teray 's hand and held it . The sensation was much like being linked with her again . Teray could feel her begin to relax . He could feel himself relaxing . He had not realized how tense he was . Then a woman named Rain came over with a message for Amber . “
56297	56313	56293	56293	He	1075	" Amber winced , got up , and left . Rain stayed a little longer . "
56331	56336	56314	56314	I	0	” she told Teray . "
56350	56391	56337	56337	You	1076	” Teray looked up at her and forced himself to smile . It was n't hard . She was a beautiful woman , well - shaped , loose down her back . Another time , under other circumstances . . . "
56398	56402	56392	56392	I	0	” he said . “
56419	56420	56422	56422	you	1076	” "
56428	56439	56422	56422	you	1076	” Rain smiled and sat down where Amber had been . “
56456	56457	56458	56458	Rain	89	” “
56460	56471	56458	56458	Rain	89	” Teray held on to the shreds of his temper . "
56488	56489	56490	56490	Rain	89	" “
56492	56501	56490	56490	Rain	89	" She jumped , and looked at him . “
56507	58246	56490	56490	Rain	89	” She was not accustomed to being refused . She flushed deeply and muttered something that was probably insulting , though Teray hardly heard . Then she stalked away angrily . Beyond being glad that she had gone , Teray did not care . Without moving , he closed his eyes and focused his awareness on the Pattern . He had been lying on his back , looking up at the stars . Focusing on the Pattern now was like shifting to view anPATTERNMASTER 163 other night sky within his own head . A mental universe . Other Patternists were seen as points of light constantly changing in shape , color , and size , reacting as individual Patternists changed their thoughts , their emotions , their actions . When a Patternist died , a point of light blinked out . Teray , seemingly bodiless , only a point of light himself in this mental universe , discovered that he could change his point of view without seeming to move . He was suddenly able to see the members of the Pattern not as starlike points of light but as luminescent threads . He could see where the threads wound together into slender cords , into ropes , into great cables . He could see where the cables joined , where they coiled and twisted together to form a vast sphere of brilliance , a core of light that was like a sun formed of many suns . That core where all the people came together was Rayal . Because Teray was doing something he had never done before , he first had difficulty understanding that the sphere of light was not a thing that he had to travel to , but a thing that he was a part of . He could not travel along the thread of himself . He was that thread . Or at best , that thread was a kind of mental limb , a mental hand that Teray discovered possessed a strong instinctive ability to grasp and hold . Teray grasped . And instantly , he was grasped . He struggled reflexively , uselessly , for a moment , then forced himself calm . He was not being hurt or even roughly handled . He was simply held in a grip that he knew he could not break . Something was done to him . He was disoriented for a moment , then he lost his focus on the Pattern and found himself channeled through to Rayal as though to a friend - as though he had simply reached out to the Patternmaster . And he was no longer held . He could break the contact if he wished . 164 PATTERNMASTER The Pattern was again clear for emergency calls . Teray waited , giving Rayal access to his thoughts so that the Patternmaster could see and understand the situation quickly . It seemed to Teray that Rayal examined his thoughts longer than necessary , but there was nothing he could do about it . He was in no position to rush the old man . Finally , though , he became aware of Rayal sending . Things have gone too far , young one . Too far ? You 're going to have to face him .. You mean you wo n't give me sanctuary ? Not even for ... Teray caught himself , stopped the thought . But Rayal guessed what his words would have been anyway . Not even for the time I have left ? That 's right , young one , I wo n't give you sanctuary for even that long . It would n't do you any good . It would keep me alive ! Me , Amber , our child . I 'd have time to learn the kind of fighting that they do n't teach in school . You 've had time . In Coransee 's House ! Do you think anyone there would dare teach me what I need to know ? I 've learned nothing ! You offered me sanctuary through your journeyman . Why are you turning your back on me now that I 've almost reached you ? You know why . I offered you sanctuary if you could make it here on your own . Obviously , you could n't ; you were caught . That does n't have to mean anything to you if you want to help me . It means a great deal . Especially since if you had n't been caught , you would probably have been killed by Clayarks . PATTERNMASTER 165 Do n't you think I had a reason for making your sanctuary conditional - for making it a thing you had to earn ? Teray was beginning to understand . He had been tested , and as far as Rayal was concerned , had been found wanting . That apparently made him not worth bothering about . Can you . . . will you help Amber ? he asked . I 'll let myself be brought into Forsyth , fight him there , if you 'll give her sanctuary . No . The thought was like a stone . There was nothing more to be said . Teray could feel the old man 's absolute inflexibility . Teray shot him a wordless obscenity and broke contact . Rayal was old and sick and useless . He had not fulfilled his responsibilities to the people for years . Teray was not really surprised to find him unwilling to go a little out of his way to help only one person . Especially when he might be helping that one to defeat Coransee . Teray still could not see why Rayal had bothered to offer sanctuary at all . Why even waste time testing Teray when he had already chosen Coransee to succeed him ? Teray sighed , opened his eyes , and looked around the camp . Apparently no one had detected his communication with Rayal . The camp was as it had been before Teray closed his eyes . He closed his eyes again , resolving to sleep one more night , live at least part of one more day before he challenged Coransec . He would not ride into Forsyth with the Housemaster . He would not give his life away . Tomorrow perhaps the Clayarks would give him another chance at Coransee . If they did , he would make good use of it this him , he would do his best to spare the people the burden of Coransee 's leadership . CHAPTER NINE The next day Clayark snipers harassed the Patternists from the moment the Patternists broke camp . The snipers kept well out of the Patternists ' range and fired their rifles more to keep the Patternists on edge than to kill . It was possible that Teray 's kill the day before had made them cautious . Which was just as well since Teray could never make such a long - distance kill now , alone . Only once did the Clayarks become careless . A trio of them lying in wait let the Patternists get too close . Coransee spotted them first . He killed all three almost before Teray was aware of them - certainly before Teray could take advantage of Coransee 's momentarily diverted attention . Or rather , Coransee injured all three Clayarks . Surprisingly , he fought Clayarks in the way Teray had before he 'd learned Amber 's way . He killed by imitating the action of a bullet and damaging Clayarks ' vital organs . But he did it with blinding speed . He jumped from one mortally wounded Clayark to another , working as quickly in his way as Teray or Amber could have in theirs . Coransee 's Clayarks took several seconds or even several minutes to die . But once he wounded them , they were helpless . His method denied the merciful quick death of Amber 's , but it was just as effective . The Clayarks apparently took Coransee 's kill as a warn- 168 PATTERNMASTER ing . No more of them came into range . They stayed well back and made noise . There seemed to be more of them now , shooting their guns at odd moments , sometimes singly , and sometimes in such large numbers that they sounded like a battle in progress all by themselves . The Patternists ' horses were skittish and had to be controlled more closely than usual . The Patternists themselves were skittish , first wearing themselves out seeking what was beyond their reach , then resolving to be content with what they could reach and assume that they were safe . But of course they were not safe . They could not know when the next Clayark with a special rifle would announce himself by killing someone . The land around Forsyth had once contained a huge population of mutes . Mutes who had lived packed together in great cities . Clusters of the buildings left over from those cities still stood , in spite of centuries of Patternist demolition efforts . Nowadays , as Rayal conserved his power and kept himself alive , Clayarks did not just frequent these ruins . They gave up their wandering and lived in them full time . The Clayarks who had been harassing Coransee 's party picked up local support . A young outsider named Goran - who happened to be riding directly behind Terayhad his horse shot from under him . Another special rifle . The sniper got away . Amber could have saved the horse , but Coransee ordered it abandoned . He was in a hurry . He ordered Goran to ride with Lias , the woman with whom Goran usually paired . As the group rode on , Teray saw Amber turn and look back . He realized that she had reached back and killed the wounded horse . He found himself wondering whether Coransee would have abandoned a wounded Patternist as easily as he had abandoned the horse . Why not ? The thought bothered Teray enough so that amid a PATTERNMASTER 169 nerve - shattering but otherwise ineffective volley of shots , he rode close to Amber and spoke to her . "
58286	58290	58291	58291	You	0	” She nodded . “
58305	58306	58310	58310	they	1082	” “
58349	58361	58343	58343	They	1082	" He had told her about his talk with the Clayark . "
58386	58387	58365	58365	they	1082	" "
58402	58403	58393	58393	they	1082	” “
58450	58462	58440	58440	them	1082	” She said nothing for a long moment . Then finally , “
58488	58497	58482	58482	their	1082	" Teray probed ahead and found the ruins . “
58539	58540	58541	58541	I	0	” "
58546	59183	58541	58541	I	0	” He glanced at her . She probably could with her healer 's propensity for poking around inside and outside of things . Fine . A moment later , as they rounded a bend , they came within sight of the ruins Amber had spotted . These were just the shells of a cluster of buildings . They were ahead of 170 PATTERNMASTER the Patternists and farther inland , away from the trail . Roofless and half demolished as they were , they could provide shelter . The shooting had died down a little now . Most of it seemed to come from behind them , where there were hills and trees for cover . Most of the land before them now was flat and empty , covered only by tall , slowly dying grass and an occasional tree . The territory around Forsyth was semiarid . Redhill was lush and green all year , but now , in late spring , this land was turning brown . A few yards away from the Patternists on one side was a sheer drop of about five meters . Beyond that was a slender ribbon of sand , and the ocean . The Clayarks could not shoot from that direction . In front of the Patternists and to their other side there was little cover beyond the dying grass - and the buildings , of course . But they were definitely empty . It looked as though the Clayarks would have to wait until the Patternists turned inland toward Forsyth . Not until then would there be more hills - the low hills that surrounded the sector itself . Teray could feel a general relaxation in the group . The shot caught everyone off guard . Coransee 's horse stumbled and went down . Amber 's horse reared , out of control for a second , and the next shot went through Amber 's left hand . Teray , fearful that she would be shot again , ignored the fallen Coransee and whipped out in search of the sniper . He could not find the creature , but he did discover the place from which the Clayark probably had fired . It was a dark round hole in the ground . Teray traced it down with his perception and discovered beneath the ground a network of tunnels . Doubtless they were ancient mute structures , dangerous now , even partially collapsed . But obviously the Clayarks had found them usable . Coransee 's horse was dead , a bullet lodged in its brain . PATTERNMASTER 171 The Housemaster took Amber 's horse and ordered Amber to ride with Teray . They rode only the short distance to the ruins , though . It was time for a rest stop , and Amber needed a protected place to repair her shattered hand . Teray needed a protected place too - to do what it was certainly time for him to do . He sat down beside Amber on the grassy floor of the building shell . She had chosen a spot as far as she could get from the others and begun to repair her hand . Her injury bothered him because healing it would leave her weakened . She had to be strong if she was to have any chance of finishing Coransee - if he left Coransee in need of finishing . On the other hand , he could not tell her to get ready , that he was about to attack . Not while there was still the possibility , however slim , of surprising Coransee . If she had been still linked with him , she would already know , and her emotional reaction would alert Coransee - and the fighting might already be over . "
59195	59200	59184	59184	I	0	” she told him . “
59212	59213	59184	59184	I	0	" “
59219	59238	59184	59184	I	0	” She opened her mouth as though to answer , but instead made a kind of wordless exclamation . “
59241	59283	59184	59184	I	0	” she said . Teray 's eyes were drawn automatically to her wounded hand where it lay in her lap , covered by her other hand . He looked at it , then back up at her quickly , in surprise . “
59289	59335	59286	59286	you	1090	” It was a foolish question . He could see what she had done . Her left wrist now ended in a smooth pale cap of new flesh . The thing that had been her left hand lay shriveled , detached , in her lap . "
59340	59344	59345	59345	I	0	” she said . “
59370	59417	59345	59345	I	0	" She held up the severed hand . It was literally nothing more than dried skin and bone - a claw . A 172 PATTERNMASTER She shrother fuli.g Iconummifi misshapen claw with at least three of the fingers held on only by shreds of dried flesh . “
59423	59427	59345	59345	I	0	" said Teray . "
59454	59473	59345	59345	I	0	" She shrugged . If she lived another month . He was grateful to her for not finishing . “
59477	59482	59345	59345	I	0	” he asked quietly . "
59505	59557	59558	59558	I	0	” She smiled slightly . He did not return her smile . He found himself staring at the smooth , new cap of skin . It was easier to try to figure out how she had done such a thing than it was to think about the things she kept saying . “
59570	59608	59558	59558	I	0	” he told her . He wanted her to eat and be as strong as she could . Coransee 's people had located and lured in several wild rabbits . They were preparing now to roast them . “
59614	59618	59619	59619	I	0	” she said . “
59634	59672	59628	59628	I	0	” He grimaced , both repelled and pleased . However she had managed it , she had kept her strength . She could fight . She looked at him silently for several seconds , then looked away . “
59678	59683	59673	59673	You	1092	” she said quietly . "
59741	59742	59722	59722	they	1094	” “
59747	59751	59722	59722	they	1094	” he said . “
59757	59758	59754	59754	you	1092	" “
59804	59807	59796	59796	You	57	” PATTERNMASTER 173 “

59830	59831	59832	59832	Amber	74	” “
59834	59835	59836	59836	I	0	" “
59870	59911	59865	59865	He	1092	" Her last words echoed Iray 's months before , when he had fought Coransee for the first time . He looked around , concealing sudden fear , and saw Coransee striding toward him . He spoke to Amber quietly . “
59931	59932	59928	59928	your	74	” "
59940	59946	59933	59933	I	0	" He touched her face . “
59955	59982	59947	59947	I	0	” She left , glaring at Coransee as she passed him . She was with her ten guards before they realized that they were on duty . "
59992	60047	59983	59983	I	0	” Coransee told Teray . Teray considered getting up to face him , then rejected the idea . If he stood , he would have to waste part of his attention keeping his feet . He leaned back against the building wall . He was tightly shielded , as ready as he could be . "
60057	60081	60049	60049	you	0	” asked Coransee softly . Teray held his face expressionless . He was almost used to Coransee invading his mental privacy by now . "
60096	60097	60093	60093	you	0	” “
60117	61187	60115	60115	Rayal	59	" Teray hit him . The blow , not one of Teray 's hardest , bounced off Coransee 's shield . Teray struck again , testing the strength of 174 PATTERNMASTER anded into date wat neither more was the shield . It was like pounding with his fists against a stone wall . He remembered with longing the muteherd Jackman 's eggshell shield . Coransee hit back , rammed Teray 's shield , not testing but trying at once to demolish . Teray 's shield withstood the blow . Teray realized already that neither he nor Coransee would be pounded into defeat in the usual way . Something more was needed . Teray swept his perception through Coransee 's brain as though through the brain of a Clayark . For an instant , Coransee frowned , seemed disoriented . But he was recovering himself even as Teray swept again . Somehow he deflected Teray 's second sweep . Then abruptly he struck back . As quick as Teray 's sweep had been , the Housemaster almost caught him unshielded . And that deflection ... Safely shielded , Teray tried to understand what had happened . It was as though he had tried to land a physical blow and had had the blow blocked by his opponent 's arm . It was not like running against the solid wall of a shield . No Patternist could lay a mind shield around his physical body . But apparently a strong Patternist could strike out with part of his strength to deflect attacks against his body . An attack that could be sensed could at the same time be deflected . Teray thought he understood . A second later Coransee tested his understanding . Coransee struck at Teray 's head . For a confused instant , Teray thought he perceived a physical object flying at him . A fraction later , he knew what it was , and used his new knowledge with fear - inspired accuracy . Without understanding quite how he knew , Teray realized that he had just avoided - or at least postponed - a cerePATTERNMASTER 175 bral hemorrhage . Coransee was unwittingly teaching him to defend himself . If only he could learn fast enough . Teray contracted the muscles of Coransee 's legs savagely . Before Coransee could stop himself , he fell screaming to the ground . He had been too busy guarding the vital parts of his body . He had not realized what agony his legs could give him . And before he could shut that agony out , Teray hit him again - hit at what had to be a weakened , unattended shield . And smashed through ! He had a foothold . Instantly Coransee forgot his legs and slashed at Teray . Teray hit back hard , hit again and again . He was a man in armor battering a naked man . He had won . Surely he had . ... Coransee slammed him back , hammered at him as no shieldless Patternist should have been able to . Teray fought with savage desperation , unable to believe what was happening . The naked man was beating him into semiconsciousness . Finally , Coransee tore Teray loose from his hard - won foothold . Tore him loose , held him , and continued to batter him . There was no longer any question . Coransee was stronger . The Housemaster broke through what was left of Teray 's shield and began beating Teray in earnest . Now Teray was the naked man . Pain . Teray could not think . He was ablaze with agony . He lashed out blindly . The old way of killing Clayarks - Coransee 's way : the large artery just where it emerged from the heart . Coransee had been foolish enough to relax his defenses . After all , he was winning . 176 PATTERNMASTER For all his speed , he could not reestablish them in time . Teray ruptured the great blood vessel . Coransee 's attack collapsed . But even as he lay on the ground clutching his chest , trying to prevent himself from bleeding to death , he took his revenge . Teray found himself suddenly disoriented . His head hurt . His head was exploding . He tried to reach up , clutch it between his hands . One of his arms would not work . He was going to be sick . He managed to turn his head so that he did not vomit over his own inert body . His mind was still working , still aware . In spite of the broken blood vessel in his brain , he was still conscious . He could still fight . With his last strength , Teray swept through the struggling Housemaster 's brain . Coransee had no defense now . He was completely occupied with his injury . Teray swept over him again and again , leaving himself no strength to keep his own body alive . He was killing both Coransee and himself , but his awareness had deteriorated to such a degree that he did not realize it . He realized only that he could not hold on to consciousness much longer . That he must do as much damage as he could while he could . He did not know when Coransee 's body went into violent convulsions . He did not know when Coransee 's muscles contracted so violently that they snapped one of the Housemaster 's legs . He did not know when Coransee bit off a large piece of his own tongue . He knew nothing until just before he lost consciousness completely . Only then did he realize that he had won . Coransee was dead . Teray opened his eyes to a vast expanse of clear blue sky . It took him a moment to see the ragged walls of the ruin and realize where he was . He was weak and tired and ravenously hungry . He tried to remember what had happened . PATTERNMASTER 177 Then it came back to him and he sat up abruptly . Too abruptly . He would have fallen back had Amber not been there to help him . She had come from nowhere , kneeling beside him , steadying him . "
61199	61214	61192	61192	You	1097	" There was food . Roast meat from somewhere . He stared at it . “
61220	61221	61222	61222	Rabbit	93	” "
61239	61341	61222	61222	Rabbit	93	” He had been out for a while , then . They had had time to cook . That was to be expected . Coransee had all but killed him . He flexed his right arm - the one that had n't worked the last time he had tried to use it - and moved his right leg . Both moved easily . Satisfied , he settled down to eating roast rabbit and fresh biscuits and drinking a great deal of water . He ate in silence for several minutes , concentrating only on the food . Finally , he spoke . "
61350	61351	61348	61348	he	1099	" "
61355	61356	61357	61357	He	1099	” "
61361	61366	61357	61357	He	1099	” She said nothing . "
61377	61378	61373	61373	You	0	” “
61382	61383	61373	61373	You	0	” “
61392	61393	61385	61386	the others	1295	" “
61422	61429	61416	61416	I	0	” He raised an eyebrow questioningly . “
61444	61445	61435	61435	They	1295	” "
61456	61506	61452	61452	Coransee	51	" He looked around for Coransee 's body . She read his glance and pointed past the clusters of waiting outsiders and women . Just beyond a ragged edge of wall , he could see two outsiders working at something , digging a hole , a grave . 178 PATTERNMASTER "
61509	61519	61452	61452	Coransee	51	" he said quietly . Amber looked at him . “
61562	61563	61557	61558	any Patternist	429	" “
61568	61569	61557	61558	any Patternist	429	” “
61578	61584	61557	61558	any Patternist	429	” He looked at her . "
61602	61867	61599	61599	your	0	” She nodded . The Patternists had gotten wood for their cooking fire from a pair of ancient dead trees behind the ruin . Now they took more of the wood , and made a funeral pyre for the fallen Housemaster . The woman , Rain , had washed smeared blood from Coransee 's face and closed his eyes . She had straightened his body on its pyre and wept over him . Now , as he burned , as Amber saw to it that he was completely incinerated , others wept too . Teray watched them impassively for a few moments , then walked away . There was something missing . He had hated Coransee . He had never been more pleased at another person 's death . Yet ... The mutes would have made a ceremony , a funeral . Mutes were ceremony - making creatures . Patternists had left such things to them for so long that there were almost no Patternist ceremonies left . For a funeral , ancient words would have been said , and the body consigned to the earth with quiet dignity . Even Patternists who thought no more of mutes than they did of draft animals attended such ceremonies with respect . They had become the due of any Patternist or mute who died - a time for friends , husbands , and wives to pay last respects . The ten who had belonged to PATTERNMASTER 179 Coransee , who now belonged to Teray , would have appreciated it . Amber came to stand beside Teray . “

61923	61940	61911	61911	me	0	" Teray turned to look at her , his expression cautious , questioning . She smiled . “

61979	61980	61968	61968	you	1104	” “
62003	62061	62062	62062	I	0	" He shuddered , knowing she meant it , knowing that he was alive only because she loved him . Not for the first time , he realized what a really dangerous woman she could be . If he could not make her his wife , he would be wise to make her at least an ally . "
62077	62086	62062	62062	I	0	” he said . She raised an eyebrow . "

62221	62242	62214	62214	I	0	” She laughed , as he had intended her to , but did not give him an answer , exactly . “
62251	62289	62244	62244	you	0	” she asked . That startled him . He could see at once that it was true , but he had not been aware of linking with her . He could not recall when it had happened . "
62295	62299	62290	62290	I	0	” she said . "

62375	62432	62368	62368	I	0	" He kissed her . She had put him in just the right frame of mind for the other thing he had to do . He went over to the cluster of outsiders and women who stood watching as Coransee 's ashes were covered with earth . When that was done , he spoke to them . "
62442	62447	62368	62368	I	0	” he told them . “
62460	62513	62514	62514	We	1117	" They obeyed silently . Some of them , Rain in particular , clearly resented him , but they had seen him kill their Housemaster in a fair fight . Custom said they should lower their heads and accept him as their new Housemaster , unless one of them wanted to challenge . "
62520	62524	62514	62514	We	1117	" he said . “
62556	62569	62570	62570	I	0	” The ten Patternists understood him . They began to look apprehensive . "
62582	62586	62587	62587	I	0	” he continued . "
62599	62607	62608	62608	You	1121	" Immediately there was protest . PATTERNMASTER 181 “
62620	62627	62608	62608	You	1121	” said a man named Isaac . “
62647	62658	62659	62659	We	1117	" Teray said nothing , just looked at the man . “
62676	62677	62665	62665	you	1121	" "
62686	62687	62688	62688	You	1121	” "
62699	62700	62692	62692	Coransee	94	" "
62708	62735	62736	62736	Lord	1122	" Isaac glared at him for a moment , then glanced out to where the ashes of Coransee were buried . Finally he lowered his head . “
62738	62753	62736	62736	Lord	1122	” It was Goran who spoke . There was no hostility in his voice . “
62779	62780	62781	62781	I	0	" "
62784	62828	62781	62781	I	0	" He was surprised to realize that he actually was as confident as he sounded . He had never gathered such a widespread group before , yet he had no doubt that he could do it , or that he should do it . “
62833	62837	62781	62781	I	0	” he said . “
62846	62847	62848	62848	You	1123	" “
62858	62870	62871	62871	You	1123	” Rain . Teray had expected to have trouble with her . “
62895	62911	62885	62885	You	1123	” She was standing up now , and shouting . Teray spoke to her quietly . “
62921	62922	62885	62885	You	1123	” "
62935	63001	63002	63002	I	0	" She was much stronger than Jackman , but getting through her shield was not too difficult . Very carefully , he pushed her into unconsciousness - that to prevent her from wasting her strength fighting him . He formed a link with 182 PATTERNMASTER her . The unity was not pleasant even while she was unconscious , but he would get used to it . "
63007	63013	63002	63002	I	0	” he told the others . "
63067	64568	63065	63065	Goran	91	” He had chosen Goran because he knew the young outsider would not refuse . Goran opened . Beside him , taking her cue from him , Lias also opened . That got things started . It was not necessary for Teray to force anyone else . Within seconds , he controlled the combined strength of ten Patternists . He had linked , then taken from all ten at once . The exhilaration he felt was something totally new to him . The canopy of his awareness first seemed almost as broad as the sky itself . Feeling like some huge bird , he projected his awareness over the territory . He could see , could sense , the lightly wooded land dotted with ruined buildings . He could see the distant ranges of hills , was aware of the even - more - distant mountains . The mountains were far beyond his striking range . In fact , they were near Forsyth , still over a day 's journey away , but he could see them . He swooped about , letting his extended awareness range free through the hills and valleys . Then , finally , he settled down , and focused his awareness on the Clayarks who formed a wide half - circle around his party . He swept down on them , killing . Before , with Amber , he had killed dozens of Clayarks . Now he killed hundreds , perhaps thousands . He killed until he could find no more Clayarks over all his wide range . He even checked the system of underground tunnels . When he was finished , he was certain that there were no more Clayarks anywhere near enough to affect him or his party . Then suddenly Rayal was with him . PATTERNMASTER 183 You 've done well , young one . Very well . But be careful Is with ful of ? he he old Keep your links with them . What am I being careful of ? he asked coldly . You or my people ? He would never forgive the old man for refusing him help when he needed it so desperately . Rayal picked up his thought . I do n't care whether or not you forgive me , young one . But keep in mind what you told Coransee 's people a few minutes ago . I suspect I 'm even less patient than you are . Teray took the hint . What do you want of me ? Let the woman know that you 'll be unconscious for a while once you let go of your people 's strength . Tell her not to try to help you — just to keep your people of you . She did it once . She 'll have to do it again . It 's a good thing you had n't taken from her too . He had not taken strength from Amber because she had obviously been tired . She had done her share for the day , he had thought . Now , obediently , he relayed Rayal 's thought to her . Rayal continued before she could reply . Now let them go . All at once , the way you took them . If you try it one at a time , you might kill the last ones by giving back too much to the first ones . Teray obeyed , let the strength of the ten Patternists snap away from him like a released spring . The breath seemed to go out of his body . There seemed to be nothing left of him . He sagged , the strength of his muscles gone . The strength of his mind kept him alive , but it did nothing more . He could still understand Rayal 's mental voice speaking inside him , but it would be a while before he could respond . It 's never easy , sent the old man . But the first time is always the worst . Ten or ten thousand , it does n't make any difference if they are n't compatible with you . You pay for 184 PATTERNMASTER the power you take from them . You pay whether you take it through a few temporary links or through the Pattern itself . Can you tell whether the others are all right ? Teray could not project the thought . He had no strength for that . But he hoped Rayal would pick it up . They 're fine . Even the one you had to knock out is all right . They wonder what 's the matter with you . They are n't the only ones . Rayal projected amusement . You 're fine . Recovering faster than I expected . You 'd better be fine . I 've stayed alive fifteen damnable years longer than I wanted to , waiting for you . In his surprise , Teray could not form a coherent thought . Surprised , young one ? It does n't matter . As long as you 're good enough to succeed me , nothing else matters . But why would you wait for me ? You had chosen Coransee . Coransee had chosen himself . But he said ... That 's right . He said . Of course , he could have succeeded me . No doubt he would have if you had n't killed him . But you did n't want him to ? He was n't good enough , young one . He was stronger than I am . That 's not surprising . He was stronger than I would be alone - though I never let him know it . But the strength was all he had . That healing ability that your Amber found in you was all but missing in him . She 's not the only healer who 's tried to teach him . But why would healing ability be that important to a Patternmaster ? The healing part of it is n't . It 's the way a healer can kill . The way Amber taught you . Without that method just now , you would have killed at least three of the people you just PATTERNMASTER 185 took power from . Three out of ten . You would have been punching holes in Clayarks , wasting strength that was n't yours to waste . Imagine killing thirty per cent of the Patternists in even an average - size House . Teray winced away from the idea . Why did n't you tell me ? Why did n't you tell him ? If he understood , he might not have had to die . I would n't have sacrificed one of Jansee 's sons if he had n't had to die . Do you really think anyone could have talked him out of wanting the Pattern ? You could have , perhaps . Young one , me least of all . Think ! The only thing that kept him from attacking me outright to take the Pattern was the belief that it would come to him without a struggle if he waited a little longer . Could he have taken it ? Very possibly . Teray sighed , feeling the strength flowing back into his body . He could have opened his eyes if he had wanted to and seen Amber next to him waiting . I will never gather the strength of the Pattern in my mind again , sent Rayal . It would kill me . When the need arises next , young one , the Pattern will be yours . That will kill me , too , but at least I 'll die alone - not take thousands of people with me . But you ca n't just give it to me . Others will contest . ... I will give it to you . You 'd win it anyway . If there was anyone better than you around , I would n't have chosen you . And once you have it , with your health and strength , those who contest will be no more to you than that girl Rain . Remember that and treat them gently . Your only real opponent is dead . But another healer ... a better healer ... You 've got a better healer sitting next to you . And she 'll G 24 186 PATTERNMASTER always be a better healer . You wo n't ever surpass her in healing skill . And she wo n't ever surpass you in strength . There are plenty of better healers , but no stronger healers . And no weaker healer could survive what you just survived . You have the right combination of abilities . Teray sighed , opened his eyes , and sat up . He looked at Amber and she nodded slightly . “
